Actor Paxton made his directing debut with this creepy, obscure and competent thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who chases his two sons into wildcat killings, claiming that the victims are not human beings but "demons "and that they were selected by God to destroy these" demons. " All this is counted in flashback by one of the now grown-up children (Matthew McConaughey), the skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It's hard to forget this movie automatically; better than most of the serial killer features, is a sinuous and haunting tale told in a direct way with a minimum of movie tricks. Paxton, laudably, barely shows blood to the end. Well represented by everyone, especially the two young actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I've deduced any point is because I can understand that some people may find it all hard to bear. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
