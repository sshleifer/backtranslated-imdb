Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve several murders among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate overly intricate mysteries (like that), but I love this movie. He moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that only speed up the narrative), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a bedroom murder that was incredible) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very smooth and great as Vance - he does not seem to be acting - he is Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do, but adds class and beauty to production. Everyone is also very good, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinct voice and some of his lines were hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basically, an excellent Hollywood murder mystery of the 1930s. Worth seeing. <br /> <br />
