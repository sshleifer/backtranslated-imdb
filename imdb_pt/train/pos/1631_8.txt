This movie has it all. Dress jokes, subtle jokes, play on words and verses. It is a ragtag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes who unite to defeat a common enemy. If you watch this more than once, you will find that you are quoting as Animal House (and yes I love Animal House as well). I put in the top 15 funniest movies. The major of a boys' military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause problems (in this movie he's right). He is sadistic, indifferent, cruel and has to be withdrawn. The group of kids who do not get along at the beginning, ends up getting together to survive and get rid of the Major with a crazy plan that only Mad Magazine could write. A must see - you'll love it!
