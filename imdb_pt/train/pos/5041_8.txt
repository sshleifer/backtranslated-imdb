Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer pursued by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he says that the serial killer is in fact his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life from childhood. They were a simple family of three people: his widowed father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night his father reunites the two brothers and says that an angel of God had visited him and appointed his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I watched it again, now on DVD. Despite being a low budget film, the script is crisp, flawless. The cast is excellent but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to play by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror film. A great debut behind the camera. I'm sorry for the Brazilian title of this movie: 'The Hand of the Devil'. If only it were "The Hand of God," it might be acceptable. But calling this movie "devil's hand" is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Hand of the Devil"
