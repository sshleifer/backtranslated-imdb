In fact: drug use, shoot-'em-ups in shells, 'Matrix' bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races and a lone vampire - all in the same movie - seems like a story that could only be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what 'Moon Child' is, and more. While all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for an exaggerated B movie of the week, 'Moon Child' brings with it only a few obstacles and difficulties along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a brave, definitely independent feel, jumping from one scene to the next, not in smooth transition, but in sporadic jumps and limits, giving glimpses into the lives of the characters and barely getting a real plot . But the film makes no apologies, instead turning the story into friendship, love, trust and betrayal, all clothed with sugar in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society in conflict with gangsters and vampires. HYDE as the sombre vampire 'Kei' is excellent, giving character depth and balancing Gackt's overzealous acting as 'Sho', an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful 'Son' who befriends an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their friends and family extended through different periods of their lives, and how simple friendship can easily be transformed into grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Although the action is sometimes very unusual and unrealistic effects appear only to show, one thing the movie never does is boast about the immensely popular Asian singers that it features. Superstars as actors have their flaws and their characters as well. The film rarely gets boring and ends where it should, after jumping a little. 'Moon Child' is quite nice, funny at times and even very touching: definitely worth it!
