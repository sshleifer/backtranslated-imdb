This place in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss. Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them, but reluctantly accepts them. It looks like she's studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft! Come on!) Before she can finish the course, although the college is closed because of the war (???) and she's chief teacher Browne David Tomlinson). And she and the children travel around a bed with the help of a magical bedknob. <br /> <br /> I first saw this when I was 9 and vaguely remember loving it. Surely you do not stand up as an adult! The story is silly (even for a fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly unpleasant. Also Roddy McDowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Naboombu Island, which is run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney) and has a very violent and too long game of football between animals. There are some saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are great; the songs (forgettable) are pleasing; The long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the special effects Oscar winners are still quite impressive in the end. But the weak story line, the poor animation and the nasty kids really do away with it. I've heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give this to a 7.
