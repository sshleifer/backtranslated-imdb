In the late 1800s, San Francisco, the poor and well-dressed Errol Flynn (as James J. Corbett) works in a bank and likes to participate in local "fights" with co-worker Jack Carson (as Walter Lowrie). One day, the beautiful Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) enters the "Comstock Bank", where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so impressed by the elegant beauty of Mrs. Smith, who offers to carry her purse. Smith is taken covertly with the beautiful Flynn, but is admonished by his impetuosity. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (in fact, collector's attempt) makes him a courtesy affiliation to the flashy "Olympic Club". conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's smug manner and practical joke (he tickles men in the parallel bars) irritates the "Club" members. When an English boxing champion visits the club, members try to convince Flynn to fight the man. They are hopeful Flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> First-time producer Robert Buckner has put together a good package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner was certainly heating up the success of his (script) contribution to the brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy" from the studio. Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was a "Gentleman Jim" - this story is supposed to be filming the true James J. Corbett's autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd" - but, this film must be significantly fictionalized. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive leader; he maneuvers the script lightly and should have been recognized, in the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's characterizations have been (are?) Neglected as great performances, and this is one of them. Smith does well as his female interest, skillfully conveying his emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes the nonsense seem soft and extravagant. The supporting cast is a treasure trove, from the noisy Alan Hale (as Pat Corbett) to the walk-on Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
