This is a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! A splendid time is guaranteed for everyone. The audience (with a few celebrities such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is, as always, quite surprising: from small children to former activists of Them know the words of all songs of color, and some of them are crying when Paul invades "blackbird "" yesterday "" all my love "and all the treasures of his catalog (which, except John Lennon and Dylan, can claim such a repertoire?) There are two particularly moving moments: The double tribute to Lennon and Harrison, first "here today", performed solo (the title was included in "tug of war" 1982 and was his best track), then "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - "The long and winding road" surrender, a key moment, when Paul's voice cracks, as he is moved to tears by the hearts that tour team members hold in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember, in the early seventies, when people despised Paul. , because he was not involved in politics, as his former partner was. They had to change their mind to Paul is a committed artist: "fame is great because it allows charity". The film shows different aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is anything but selfish.
