A realistic depiction of young love for the college set, but also appealing to an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see films with black urban characters that can appeal to older, non-black audiences, and show a more real representation of the lives of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place on a university campus and a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are several well-known friends and situations that affect them for better or for worse. Typical plot some may say, but this really was unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself hoping for the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in their history. Moments of deep reflection and revelation arose from the performances of the actors. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant film that I would approve for the young at heart, in love or who never fell in love. Great movie. I'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
