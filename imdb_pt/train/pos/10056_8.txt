We observed this in my Women's Health Issues class to show how women are treated as inferior to men in many societies, and I loved this movie. I intend to try to get a copy of myself to watch. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to everyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this movie was exactly what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family, despite its rating. This is a movie that I'll show my kids. The teacher in our class wanted the film to be primarily about educating about women, too, but this movie was more than that. It's one of those movies that will stay in my mind forever and be a favorite.
