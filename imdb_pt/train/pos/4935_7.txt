In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels queasy and leaves a poker game while beating the criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service discovers that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find out who had any kind of contact with the man inside forty. Eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The city's mayor attributes the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find the killers who are infected with the plague and inoculate them. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story but is still effective and with a great villain. The surrounding story did not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs despicable scum on his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Panic in the Streets"
