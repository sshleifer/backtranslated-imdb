That's My Bush is a live action project by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after a season, not because of bad reviews (actually had good reviews), but because it was very expensive. is a very funny parody of an average network TV sitcom. It's also a political satire. Now this is far from as good as South Park, but it's a very funny parody of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire. face playing in whats my bush looks a lot like it! If you can find the program, check it out. There are many laughs to be made! <br /> <br /> 9/10
