One of the ten best comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> This looks like a comedy so light and joyful that it sings. Keaton's comedies are _internal, harmonious, cleverly ordered, thought out. Wonderfully fun, deliberately delicious and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a sketch of a series of comedies, if I were to sketch one. A triple love story will delight viewers; I want to bring this approach here - Keaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINATION, down or to REBORS. Again, a couple crosses the waters of time and times in the Stone Age, Rome and the times of Keaton, a Muslim country, Renaissance Italy and China. The same device works in both films - a dark and weird melodrama; - the other, a light and virtuous comedy. Keaton is essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with Lang. The baby Wanted by Buster and Beery is cool. I found the THREE AGES well written and intelligent, without being ostensibly sophisticated; the plot is basically POPEYE as the baby is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivals Keaton and Beery. <br /> <br /> Keaton's film is simply very enjoyable, and perhaps No one would be tempted to claim this seems ambitious fun? Not yet, but it's a lot of fun, great fun, a lot of fun. And Wallace Beery makes a good foe.
