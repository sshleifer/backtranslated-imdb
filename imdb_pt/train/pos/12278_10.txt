well, I said everything in the summary, I just love the movie and the cast ... I would give each actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 years old now and I've watched four different periods and I I always think I will not cry and I always do, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. it was absolutely brilliant, jeremy irons too..just brilliant ... I wish the film received more prizes ... I really do not know anyone who watched it and did not love it ... also, Glenn by the way was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything clear and Esteban loved each other so much, and as the blanca was close to her parents ...
