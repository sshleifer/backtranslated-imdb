All dogs go to Paradise is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I first saw it when I was 3 years old. Now I'm 12 years old and rent it, it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories, these were "the days". I love music, I love it when Charlie is coming in the sky, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play Charlie's voice so well. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it's so original and great. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If I could go back to those days. I love the characters. If that's how memories come back when I'm 12, imagine how I'll feel when I'm 19, hopefully I'll be able to see it when I'm older. When I first saw this, I never knew I'd really look back and feel like this, I hope you're available to watch. I am so happy that this movie was made and the incredible idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give a perfect 10. It's an incredible movie. It is so difficult to explain the feeling, when I get older and have children, I hope they feel that feeling.
