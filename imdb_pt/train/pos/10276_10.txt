Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural suggestion of what it is to unfold in this intense drama. All the compositing devices that Bach has perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained apply to this film. There is no mutual tenderness between the two main characters and the protagonist in the final scene which seems to me justified in stating that she was raped despite her victimizer feeling she was warned that he was an idiot. Mamet convincingly explores the emotional gulf and differences between genders, but I feel he has no idea how they really complement each other given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous approach to the interaction between the sexes, I wonder how that work would have ended? As it exists, it is very bleak and malicious.
