This movie is a real gem. The plot arc is set in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives completely believable. The dialogue is new and so real. The situations are unique to the characters and are not clich√©s or banal. Until the climax, that's it. So it's as if the film got off the rails a bit and it was a little bit corny and unbelievable. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 are truly remarkable. I gave it a 8. There are some notable performances here. Check out this movie.
