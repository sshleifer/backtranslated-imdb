I gave it a 10, since everyone seemed to like it and would have been rude not. The reason I'm bothering you is to add a personal observation about Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I saw "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the clever color sequence where everything except blood is in black and white) a few times and "The House On Haunted Hill" many times. <br /> <br /> Even I'm not old enough to see them when Castle was with his showman tricks, so I can enjoy them on their own merit. And while most pass it as second rate, schlocky, hammy, etc., I believe they do it a disservice. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Homicidal" is GENUELY shocking and works today - and The premise of "The Tingler", though silly, was highly original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. Having used this Frank Lloyd Wright house as its exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid cast, plus good score and production values ​​- when I first saw it in a crowded late-night performance in the late 1960s , produced a public reaction. I had not seen it before and have not seen it since. <br /> <br /> It was the moment when the heroine is alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Without any telegraphy of what is to come, the camera slowly pulls away, forcing AUDIENCE to shift its gaze to ... I'm saying no more (my "spoiler" statement above just covers THIS movie ). <br /> <br /> The point is, I believe that this maneuver was DELIBERATE - not accidental - and when it happened, the whole audience shouted (including most of the movie). men!) It took the audience ten minutes to calm down. <br /> <br /> Now that's top movie. An extravagant showman he could have been, but "House" and the other two movies I mentioned were good movies. Castle may not have been a Hitchcock, but neither was Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on one's quirks and forget to examine your TALENT. So, I hope this documentary has recognized that. I am looking forward to see you.
