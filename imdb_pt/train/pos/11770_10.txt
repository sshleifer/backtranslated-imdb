I was hoping this would be good as a Timothy Dalton James Bond fan and although it was not his well-deserved '3rd Bond outing' it was a laugh. Belushi brought a bit of good humor to his part, and Dalton considered it very well, but it was probably underused. part of it was a camping version of jack nicholson on some good men. the other Brit in was a bit shocking, but overal was a laugh.
