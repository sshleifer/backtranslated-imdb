As a Westerner observing the vision of another culture and the tradition of marriage, I found the Just Married fascinating and charming. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. However, this is the case in this Hindi movie. Told with humor and new perspective, we learn about Abhay and Ritika who have met only once and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As said, it is hard to believe in this affluent age of cell phone that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still happens. We see the strangeness this young couple feels when they meet on their first night and how they try to forge a bond, even if they do not know each other. We see different visions of marriage and commitment as presented by other couples also on vacation, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of marital commitment. There is music, witty dialogue, moving moments, mixing and comparing new forms and traditions. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the story's truthfulness, but it's still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little banal and the bus incident a little taken and forged; however, the film in general was worth watching.
