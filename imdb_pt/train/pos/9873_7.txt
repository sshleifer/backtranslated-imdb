Lily Mars, a small-town girl who lives in Indiana, dreams of succeeding on Broadway and her aspirations gain momentum when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to her hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything for Thornway to notice, but he gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to stage her show, Lily follows (unknown to John, of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in her upcoming gig, just as a favor to her family, however Thornway begins to fall to this young girl and a romance flourishes, which makes the protagonist of the series, Isabel Rekay, get jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the romance of John-Lily that causes friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small role in the play, which may also jeopardize the romance. A very charming film, and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth while it should be humorous, never threatened her singing career) I liked the character of Heflin (Thornway) when he was angry with Lily, instead of being romantic. The film came to be somewhat predictable and the scenes were not put together so well together, but a very nice film. Evaluation, 7.
