The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two, we received the last installment. Here's my opinion: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) in the coattails of those who know everything. He's been running for a long time. This time, it ends. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, incredible writing, fantastic direction, suspense and some of the best action of the summer. Matt Damon offers possibly his best performance so far. He has the conviction and swollen desire of the troublesome killer. <br /> <br /> There is some clever humor here and a good suspense. Reactions to certain events will make you laugh (in a good way) or twist. (or both) I have heard many intelligent laughter in the theater and many palms. The audience was loving it. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum delivers it all in a gift wrapped package. All goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best movie this summer. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer movie thrillers should be made. I love the Bourne trilogy.
