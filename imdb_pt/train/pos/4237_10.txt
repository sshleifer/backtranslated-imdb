Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg chose not to wear the traditional loin cloth. I hope no one throws you like Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first two films of the Planet, but Estrella Warren barely shows the neckline - her hair is always on the way. Tim Burton could have sexed this saga and given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the caste Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her fantasy that looks like a great curtain. She is cute, but all love is restricted to eager glances and a kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence, which discusses interspecific sex between robots and humans, but never surrenders - The Planet of the Apes insinuates romance between species between humans and monkeys, but only tips. Lisa Marie is the only monkey that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors like Tim Roth, Carter and Paul Giamatti, who interpret the scenery as a trio of monkeys and are fun to watch. Superlative (a certain Oscar), costumes, scenery, music make this movie the summer hit of 2001.
