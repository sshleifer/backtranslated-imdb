The movie was not so good. The book is better. But the movie was not so bad. It was interesting to say the least. The plot had enough suspense to keep me watching though I would not say I was really interested in the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :) They have some cute scenes that should appeal to the romantic. Overall, I would give the movie 7 or 8. It was not bad, just missing a bit of plot.
