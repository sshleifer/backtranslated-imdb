I loved Joan. Great performance. Why is not she good? I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre soon after ... she's just getting better. My heart was racing. Great old drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm happy to have you on video. I do not know what else you need in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... a trial ..... The costumes are very cool . Makes me wonder what the budget for this movie was? I wish they would still make movies like this. Whenever they try, they seem to make an extravagant movie. Black and white movies still hold a certain mystery.
