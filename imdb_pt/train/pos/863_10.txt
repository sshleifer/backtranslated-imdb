I was totally involved in this movie from the first to the last minute. It is brilliantly filmed, with many camera angles and interesting and original techniques employed. The plot involves a deaf woman who is chosen by friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention of finding love. He is an ex-convict and she takes advantage of him to take revenge on those who have hurt her. In return, she must help you with an assault that requires your lip reading skills to do so. The film transcends in a dark noir film, with a couple of truly excellent scenes and an even better ending. The real beauty in this movie comes from the way the director takes advantage of the main character's disability. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic changes from silence to noise keep the blood pumping, for sure. Add a comedy of dark humor and a tone of erotic sexual repression that results in a great movie. It's the kind of movie that Hollywood really wants to do, but it can not.
