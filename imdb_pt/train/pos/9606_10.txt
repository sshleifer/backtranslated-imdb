This was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It hit the exact point of what it really is about Bulimia and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting. It showed how people with Bulimia tend to think of things like their view of life, friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows you what Bulimia's problem is, is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. He showed that people with Bulimia do not have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. It has to do with just them and them. This shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention on them. It showed that Beth needed attention at that moment and she needed her mother's attention more at that moment.
