The comment from the person who said that Pat Robertson is bad and his program is bad has nothing to compare what is wrong and fair. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good from evil and good from evil! He does not even know he fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to know Him now, that's fine. He still loves you, but when you finally bow down to him, and you go, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You go there at your own decision and your spit sets it! May God have mercy on you and give you an experience on the Damascus Road. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson's ministry is one reason I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God He did! You have the right to say what you have said, but you have no right to curse your words. God have mercy on you.
