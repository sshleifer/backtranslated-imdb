I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I was talking to my brother and my mom at the same time). Can someone tell me what happened to her? I saw a little that the husband was listening to someone was talking to his wife in the room and then he opened the door, she is already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to her? She killed herself? How could she arrange everything like the phone calls while she was at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer? Anyone can explain me, please. I'm so curious !! (in the end, I read that she suffered from the Personality of Multiple Imbalance). Previously.
