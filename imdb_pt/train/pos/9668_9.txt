This is a little movie, few characters, theatrical.And still says something about Ireland that you will not find anywhere else.This movie is Ireland. The boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and above all Madge. I know them.I'm in the pub with them or kneeling pray to them. They are our sad story and they are our gift.
