Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which certainly beats the male type). He flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with the captor's theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of female libido is sometimes superficial and spasmodic, but Borden traveled far beyond the feminist dogma of women gaining power through their insatiable lust. An impressive scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing shorts, asking her to show how she rides a horse. He pushes a whip between his legs, pressing it against his groin, and this greatly increases his arousal. <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly, he leaves her at home and she swears openly in the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the crook, and although he is far from beautiful, he chooses Janes and has enough screen presence to make a person believe that women could swallow his line. In all accounts, Sean Young proves that she is a strange person and she is unattractive. However, in this film, as district attorney, her intense face and slender body of long limbs and sharp hips and disconnected movements periodically turn into erotic fascination. His performance is blunt and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that she is so at odds with the modern and irresponsible zeitgeist that I really appreciate it.
