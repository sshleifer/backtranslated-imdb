I saw this movie with a lot of friends and although only two of us left the theater thinking how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, that was because it's not to be taken so seriously, basically it's a movie that mocks horror movies and does a great job ... There seems to be another movie coming out this way too, a ... Scary Movie ?? Well, that's Australian and original !!! Jessica Napier does an amazing performance and Sarah Kants has a brilliant future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move and Kylie was even better. The Impossible Princess was Queen of the Screen !! I recommend watching this movie, as you will guess by the end the connection with Raffy, Hilary and The movie that never ended 20 years ago.
