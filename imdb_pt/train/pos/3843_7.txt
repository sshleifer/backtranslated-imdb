The first time I saw this movie in the theater at a foreign film festival, I found intriguing, fascinating, sensitive bisexual artist. Very European, very Dutch! Recently I rented it for a second showing and I barely managed to laugh at the mad writer's overloaded work with a complex of religious and sexual persecution. Get a grip! This guy is a profiteer, living from society. I suspect the real reason he's having these fantasy nightmares about the "spider-woman" is that his guilt complex is coming in after ignoring his mother's advice about getting into cars (and bedding) with strangers! Not only is he making outrageous sums of (probably untaxed) loot to make up stories (lying guilt trip), but he is too cheap to pay for a haircut, hence he rushes the salon owner. So he has the guts to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this movie was made. On a serious note, it was fun to see some of Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much after all?
