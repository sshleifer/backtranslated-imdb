A great cartoon of Bugs Bunny from previous years has Bugs as an artist in a shop window at a local department store. Once he is ready for the day the manager arrives, tell him he will be transferring soon. Bugs is happy to accept that he finds out that the new work is in taxidermy ... and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. Animals as they say, a certain rabbit. This causes a battle of intelligence between the rascal and his now former employer. I found this short to be delicious and definitely one of the best of the early 1940's. It still remains so funny almost 60 years later. This short animation can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
