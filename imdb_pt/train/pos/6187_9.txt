There are moments in the movie that are so terrible, your teeth hurt. But knowing that it was only a few weeks before the Code made the movies innocuous and bland, Paramount hastened production before hints and leering went out of style. Vanities is so horribly anti-feminine that it's delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are displayed with price tags that insult a prostitute from the Bronx. They emerge from mollusks (poked, poked, wink, wink) in absolute submission postures. Assholes of the law, so stupid that they can not find the door, can look at their skirts and laugh. Chorus girls with bare breasts sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (Can they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) As we listen to "Sweet Marijuana" and watch as blood falls on the chest of a coriander. <br /> <br /> Of course, Carl Brisson learned his lines phonetically and does not seem to know what he's saying. But it's all worth it, since Norma steals the show while no one is looking. <br /> <br /> Dedicating a moment of this fragile flu is seriously losing the sense of the whole exercise. Watch this with a founding member of NOW and get ready to justify all the Hollywood machismo between body blows. <br /> <br /> Toby Wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> A must-see for Memory Lane.
