I originally met Linda Feferman's Seven Minutes in Heaven when I was 14 and worked at a video store and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized it is a lost treasure. The film starred Jennifer Connelly nearly twenty years before she would win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a softer, smoother and softer version of Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful from the 1980s, and that's exactly why it's so good. It's honest, not forced like these movies, and parents will love watching this movie with their kids. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he must live because his life at home sucks. With the support of Natalie's friend Polly, played beautifully by Maddie Corman, she leaves. But this movie is not about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can do. The three tracks are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest, that what appears best in their performances is heartbroken. These characters really care about each other. It's a great movie to show kids who are reaching pre-teenage adolescence. <br /> <br />
