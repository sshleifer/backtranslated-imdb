Not that much happens in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but that was not true, and she found herself when she met this person who was doing some research for her next job. There should be more types of movies like this, not even as old as considered "mature" (im 13 by the way) and still have the idea and the point of the film. The main point is, in my opinion: DO NOT THINK YOU CAN NOT HAVE A BETTER LIFE, BECAUSE YOU CURRENTLY HAVE THIS. <br /> <br /> Although I admitted that I was thinking of watching another movie, but after reading all the comments and saw the trailer I decided on this even though I did not know that much action would appear in the movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the movie, and it's a very good ending.
