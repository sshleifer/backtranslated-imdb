I just watched this movie and I can honestly say this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Guy not only gathers the cast of a movie from the list ab (ish) and turns them into such glorious characters, he gave us a movie with a fantastic diverse story with a lot left to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and delivered to them on a board ... yet these are the movies that get poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
