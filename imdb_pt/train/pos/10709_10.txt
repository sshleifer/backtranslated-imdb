This movie really woke me up, as if I woke up the main male character in this movie bravely different from his sleep of life. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) takes his mediocre life safe from a bank-box in a small English provincial town, until the gorgeous and wild girl Nadia (Nicole Kidman), sorted by email of Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, according to the plan of Johns. However, a flaw appears - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns' language. Though calm and unemotional on the outside, John gets so interested in the beautiful Nadia that, instead of using the full refund policy of the mail service, he buys a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What happens from now on? in the plot really shakes John poor of his sleep of a securely paid employee decently paid into a decently decision-making action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message "probably would have acted the same way." <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz form a great team acting like Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, "almost" only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, however light a Russian native for the hard work done so the words sound good. Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character very different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you're certainly not ready to stop watching when the final titles appear, you'd rather feel like you're in the middle of the plot, and get the desire to see the sequence as soon as it is launched. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and get this movie right away and watch and enjoy it. In short, it has an unusual plot, great acting and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of ​​the "rude awakening" of the safe and routine artificial life of a wheel in a Society's machine, the life that Fellowship members were so eager to abandon, and the machine Pink Floy sings " coming to the machine! ") I bet, in the end, John was a little out of his mind with Sophia on the way to the unknown than not having met her. Thank you, writers, for the great story and make it a sequel! And you can stage it and name the location, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999% of potential viewers, I'm sure of that.
