At first, I was surprised that the main character on a TV show could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought about trying. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and I look forward to the evenings of Wednesday just to watch it, so for the next week I watch a few more times on my DVR. Colorful characters, witticisms, quick dialogues, and unique new situations attract me and captivate me from beginning to end. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to see when they work the novel around the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the character of Detective Emerson Cod continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She rocks me! The voice of the narrator is fun to hear and cinematography gives me the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a TV show. I recommended my family and friends to activate "Pushing Daisies" and they are addicted too !!! The show is worth waiting for a week for a new episode and if you have not seen "P.D.", I recommend watching it!
