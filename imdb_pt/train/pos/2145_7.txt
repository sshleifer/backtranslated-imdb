"Shall We Dance?", A gay movie from Japan, tells of an overworked accountant and a family man who is drawn to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he sees from the train during his daily commute. What he finds in the studio are dance lessons and, above all, himself. Funny, poignant and absolutely charming, "SWD" is an award-winning movie that deserves to be seen by more mature viewers. (B)
