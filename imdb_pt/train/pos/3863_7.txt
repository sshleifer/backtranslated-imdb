This is an interesting series that takes people from real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of his real story with a character in the continuing series who participates in this story. Railway Detective "Matt Clark" - plays a role in tracing the famous Old West Outlaws in stories that are, at least in part, based on true accounts. In that sense, it's almost an anthology series, and as someone else pointed out, this strange structure puts some timeline conflicts with real events, but it's a fun-filled series with a lot of action to satisfy Western audiences of the 1950s - and yet take it well 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western outfit while facing some of the worst villains in history. And your girl partner, Frankie, is a good dish. If you are a western fan, be sure to check it out if you get a chance.
