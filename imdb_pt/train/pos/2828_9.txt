After tracking it for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> It's not disappointing because I'm one of those SMAP fans who need to see all of their work and I finally got to see the so-called Goro hot movie. But I could not believe that Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he shrinks that he made this movie. However, they found the perfect person to look embarrassed, uncomfortable and half depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can not believe he made this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many parts, not believing he actually made such a movie .... hahahaha .... <br /> <br /> But I'm glad to have watched. Thank God he grew up ....
