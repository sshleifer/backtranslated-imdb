This highly derivative movie will be entertaining for many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime movies. I liked it more, especially after the fairly flat opening minutes at the museum (although the pre-title sequence is a lot of fun and includes some of the best bits of animation). James Garner as the commander and Leonard Nimoy as the king give impressive performances.
