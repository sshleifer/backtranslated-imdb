The first tour of Reese Witherspoon on the big screen was memorable. She appears as a clean face and a half "middle", but undeniably Reese. <br /> <br /> I always liked her as an actress, and had no idea she started this young woman with her career, will understand. I really gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early. I say this because whenever I see her, the characters so far, in each portrait, she also seemed to have her own personality that lived with this character, very well indeed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first. The cinematic experience with Reese was the parody of Little Red Riding Hood that Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed it was her first time at the bat. Not so, well done Reese
