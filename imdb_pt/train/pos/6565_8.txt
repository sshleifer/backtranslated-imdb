I know the snobs in the movie are sniffing. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride in the jungle of movie B, try the "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> Slightly thin at times, but their lines and location make up the most. for this. John Hurt (God loves him), seems to be amused by playing his role as the ultra-evil white drug dealer. The Crawfords nemesis, Jake Speed. It adds a dimension to the film that only a professional like Hurt could provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you wonder why they get on well. However, together, Crawford and Christopher play such a fun team that if you can get past it for a moment, you can see yourself acting like a kid again in the face of the situations and the inherent suspense they provide. The delightful Karen Kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress who is more concerned with her savior's motives than her tormentor's. <br /> <br /> I still have to find a movie that is so fun without being lazy, or messing up the movie by trying hard. Not every movie has to be the latest "Citizen Kane." And believe me, Wells was an original. So let's remember that sometimes movies are for fun.No social commentary or trying to politically influence an audience. But just for the simple pleasure of being alive and living in a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
