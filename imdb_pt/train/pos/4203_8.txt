This is yet another brave and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist, fast director has something unusual for his previous films - a cast with a few stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this movie about a group of communist agents trying to steal secrets from America - and they will not hesitate at all for success. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters in a subway car being watched by federal agents. They know she's a link in a long spy chain. Unknown to everyone is the wildcard in the equation - a small picker (Widmark) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying. Widmark thinks it's just another purse he was looted - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he stole. Now it's Widmark alone - with the Commies and the FBI on their way. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is thrilling from start to finish. Although she has not received the best billing, a special mention must be made of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her life as a stool pigeon. Seldom did she have this chance to act and I was struck by her ability to play an old and sad lady. <br /> <br /> With regard to the script and direction, they are very good-but with one small exception. At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It's one of the few times in the movie that you'll see a woman pounded in the mouth! Now this is difficult. Later, inexplicably, they become surprisingly close - too close to be believable. Still, with as much drama and a film as effective as Noir, this can be forgotten. Watch this movie.
