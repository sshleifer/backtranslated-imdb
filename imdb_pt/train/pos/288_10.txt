This movie was great! I'm a teenager, and me and my friends all love the series, so this shows that these movies draw attention to all age groups. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite phrase in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "pink cheeks" when he is talking about his little girl. He's a great actor, just like Erin Cottrell. They pair very well and have great chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are such attractive people and are very good actors. I finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately it has been difficult for me to find films that are good and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not cheesy.
