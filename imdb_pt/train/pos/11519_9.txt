The only reason I did not give this 10 stars was the DVD format, no menus, extras, etc. However, if you ever had a dream of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most life-affirming movies I have ever seen. It's magic. The acting is superb, the plot serves purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those movies that the status of "cult" used to be. I recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love it, some can not finish it. Whenever I think or feel something is impossible, I think of the role of Alan Arkin in this film. Of course I would like to make more movies.
