Although this movie has some weaknesses, it's worth seeing. I chose the cast and I applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles different from the ones they took in the past. Both portray very disturbed people, complete with warts, but make them nice because of their humanity. The story is playing, but it's the performances that go up. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of deficiencies that I had not thought of before, but it was also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended very abruptly, but better than an emotionally manipulative ending (see "Stepmom"). The very real English scene added to my amusement - it was England in the 1990s, both urban and rural, without being depressing. .
