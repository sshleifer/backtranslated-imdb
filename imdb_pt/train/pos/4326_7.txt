I can not say how close the film follows the novel, having never read the book, but since this clock reaches six and a half hours, it is a good bet that most of the base is covered or at least we can say with some certainty that this is not an abridged version of Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> Production figures are high, well above the standards of other classic BBC series such as the Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We may believe that Dickens' London seemed, sounded and thought so. There are some occasional minor lapses - some sportsmen firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever that happened. <br /> <br /> The performance should also be applauded. Suzanne Burden is the educated and honest heroine who quietly does good. She is also cute, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtation. Denholm Elliott is his guardian (and more than that, as you can see). Burden and Elliott are two of the few characters who are good in a pure way. Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil for bad people. Another is a poor, helpless boy. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else has written that. He has all the signs of Dickens - poverty, tragic deaths, raw capitalism, the generous and rich guy in his closed home, hidden kinship, obscure motives, and the impotence or direct evil of the judicial system. Well, not the justice system as a whole, but the chancellery, which evidently was a court that ruled matters related to the distribution of property. (So ​​I gather at Wikipedia.) It became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was completely renovated in England in 1973. Twice, Elliott's character describes it as "a curse." The most impressive scene involves a money seeker lender chasing a retired soldier in the latter's gym during a fencing class. The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember of Dickens. The lender and tenant of apoplectic money is shouting threats from his seat and the sergeant turns to him and does a gentle exercise with the saber after another, each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor while the old scarlet face lender back in his seat. . <br /> <br /> Some things are missing. Often, Dickens will dwell on at least one or two fun lines of dialogue. ("Humbug!" Or "The law is a donkey"). Not here. "Bleak" house is the right title. Secondly, there are virtually no "ideal types" of Weberians - none of Micawbers, Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos, is relentlessly discouraging. One tribulation follows another, usually having to do with money or some shameful pecadillo of the past. <br /> <br /> My God, it's depressing. It is as if the author was exhaling his spleen in everything he hated in the world he knew. Poverty, all right. He knew poverty. But one wonders what the chancellery did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and it's better in two ways. There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a bit faster. And the business of Jarndyce Vs. Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right away, rather than lurking in the shadows as that mysterious "curse", so the plot is easier to follow.
