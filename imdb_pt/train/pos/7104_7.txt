Los Debutantes is the story of two orphan brothers who moved to Santiago de la South after their mother died. Silvio, the older, confident brother, gets a job for the owner of a strip club after taking the naive Victor for his 17th birthday. <br /> <br /> As Silvio blossoms under the tutelage of his boss, both brothers involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, Gracia. As the film unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and obvious ways of each manipulating the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pace. It's also very sexy, with lots of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. He uses the now popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view, out of chronological sequence. Many people hate movies like that because they do not understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies use this device. The plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction, and many other good noir movies. <br /> <br /> As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters and their motivations evolves. While the plot may be a little clich√©, it's also smart and fun. <br /> <br /> I would say it's a nice movie, worth seeing, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many movies from Chile, and it is always interesting to see noir films from other countries. Other than that, rent it if it's available, but do not lose any sleep if you're not.
