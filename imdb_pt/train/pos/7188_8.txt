Along with "King of the Rocket Men", this was still being repeated on BBC TV in the early to mid eighties. If I were carrying a time capsule from that period, both sets would definitely come in. <br /> <br /> Someone watching for the first time will think it's silly, but this is one of the best examples of "Serials". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was little my nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin's head) and it was funny to be shot he says "his bullets can not harm me", then he stumbles back, apparently less than that happy. I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I watched it again because I had fond memories of it for years, there are some good tricks and good music, it has the ingredients you expect, including water, rockfalls, trail carts ... In addition of the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner), the fencing was not as good as I remembered, and yes, it presents the inevitable episode of "flashback"! You get 8 out of 10 because you still suffer from slow pacing, filling and the other tricks. If you are interested in these serials I recommend William Witney's book, "On a Door, in a Fight, Out of a Door, in a Chase", although there is only a small entry on this series.
