I saw him at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was impressed by the absolute power that this movie has. It is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the army in the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be looked after by our government for this. The film details the psychological changes that take place in training camps as soldiers are transformed into "murderers of their country" and put to war and the after effects when they return home. It also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche. It is a tribute to soldiers and never criticizes soldiers unlike other films, instead criticizes a system that is not prepared for and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought-provoking. It stands out as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but also listening to them, and helping to support a change in how their health and well-being are met after the killing ends. <br /> <br /> The best film of the Festival so far, **** / ****
