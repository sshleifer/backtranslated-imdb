52-Pick Up never received the respect it should have. It works on many levels and has a complicated but easy-to-run storyline. The actors involved give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfect and offer deep character interpretations. Notable is also Vanity, who should have bet this on a serious acting career, given the unexpected ability she shows, and Kelly Preston, character who will haunt him for a few days. Anyone who likes action combined with a complicated story will like this.
