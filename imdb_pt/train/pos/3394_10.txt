I watched this type of movie by accident, having bought it as the B side on the DVD of The Omega Man. The Omega Man was a little disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest is just the material of the TV movies. But Soylent Green is in another league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I've never seen anything like it before. Heston casually went to bed with the "furniture" while discussing something completely different! A whole crowd of people being picked up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Okay, maybe it's been done since then - but there are not many movies that are as consistently original as this. And what the hell is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this movie without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. So I watched again, and took advantage of all the little tracks that are worth the long opening scenes. A very good script - and some good sets too. Just when you thought you had seen it all. . .
