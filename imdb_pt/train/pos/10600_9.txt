This is a very funny comedy from Ealing about a community in central London that, through an unusual set of circumstances, discovered that they are not English, but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy. The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway (better known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY) as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on news of the time. , when the Canadian government "officially" gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of royalty. The idea really reminded me of the real-life case of the Hutt River Province in Western Australia where a landowner "broke up" with the Australian government because of a wool quota dispute. (This has never been recognized by the governments of Western Australia or Australia). <br /> <br /> This is a great script that plays with many political and economic issues, more or less like the TV show "Yes Minister"; besides being a nice little eccentric bit too.
