Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was hoping to be disappointed with the movie because I heard it did not get great reviews. However, I left the cinema completely amazed at how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There was no bad acting throughout the movie, every character is believable. The romantic moments between Cruise's character David Aames and Cruz's character Sophia are incredibly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they would be a real-life couple). <br /> <br /> The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the movie and there is very little chance of you guessing the end. However, the ends are tied at the end, leaving you with a strange blend of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy by David Aames. <br /> <br /> The movie is intellectual and you have to pay attention everywhere. This is not so difficult because chances are that you will be completely drawn to the movie and will not take your eyes off the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> I usually leave cinemas forgetting everything about the movie that I just watched. But Vanilla Sky is still in my mind days after watching it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a simple and shallow movie change.
