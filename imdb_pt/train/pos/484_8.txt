Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former chess player who tries to return in a tournament organized by Italy. His brilliance is unquestionable, but his obsession with chess has disrupted his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to identify potential partners in the marriage. Vera leans to a sizeable count, but, surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met on a walk. Sascha is also taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at her second meeting. But with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess games and, with other events in his past still causing problems, will he win Natalia's heart? Oh, and he can become the chess champion too? This is an adorable film, based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is incredible, with Watson very well as the beautiful rich girl and Turturro utter perfection as the chess enthusiast timid and clumsy. James gives a good turn when the dominating mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. As for the look of the movie, it could not be better. The scenery is a "look out" type, the vintage costumes are beautiful and the cinematography deserves much applause. Yes, the story is unusual and reckoned with the use of flashbacks, sometimes becoming a movie that not everyone will like. So, too, the ending is bittersweet. However, if you like romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenario or the art of creating movies, do not miss this one. You will be helpless to resist its myriad charms.
