DO NOT judge this production for the 2 hour version released on VHS in the USA, which is an irregular and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of watching the full 6 hour version available on DVD from the UK, and I was fascinated. The deliberate rhythm and growing sense of threat are fascinating, as is the incredible visual and sound landscape; this is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and much more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was justly celebrated for his 1968 mini-series of The Odyssey, and this mini-series is equally powerful. . Just as Bekim Fehmiu has become the best screen Ulysses, Klaus Maria Brandauer may be the best screen Nero. Now, I hope that someday we will see Rossi's version of A Eneida (Eneide) that was aired on Italian TV in 1971. <br /> <br /> I am undecided which version of QUO VADIS is most powerful, this one or the version polish 2001 miniseries; each one has different virtues and, in many ways, they complement each other. Certainly, either man dominates the Hollywood tumult starring Peter Ustinov.
