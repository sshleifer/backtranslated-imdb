The most incredible spiritually uplifting film about the restoration of the gospel. Much better than any other movie or movie made about restoration so far. If you have not seen it, get on a plane to Salt Lake and see now. You will not regret! You really have a sense of what the early Saints had to face, putting full and complete faith in the prophet Joseph Smith. You finally understand some kind of understanding of the things that the prophet had to face and the persecutions he and his people faced. If you have any questions about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, just watch this movie, which will make complete and complete sense later.
