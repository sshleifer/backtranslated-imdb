Fortunately, as a student, I was able to watch "Diagnosis Murder" for several years. It's basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his son LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of outstanding entertainment. What set him apart from the many other police programs and deserved to be seen many times was the cast and quality of writing. The main cast performed well, and Dick Van Dyke's roots were animated by the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were fast paced, witty scripts, and, of course, the eavesdropping score. Unfortunately, it has been unfairly compared to "Murder," she wrote. DM is far superior, presenting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it's gone, TV's a worse place. Gone are the days of feeling good, familiar police show. Now there are just depressing 'gritty' ones.
