For me, personally, this movie falls into my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proven himself over and over again that he is a master storyteller. Through films like Aliens, The Abyss and the two Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and confident director when it comes to action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is very different from its other traits of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famous traveler sinking into his maiden voyage is legendary, so the challenge was for Cameron to make a true, interesting and interesting movie about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, became superstar overnight with the release of the film and in most movies I get angry when the characters do not have much to do, but in this film is more purposeful because, as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells his story, it is quickly apparent that it is just the story of Rose and Jack, no one else. Emotionally it is totally satisfactory and can not leave any dry eye in a theater or at home. The song became iconic and legendary. It is the best soundtrack of the composer James Horner and it evokes both the film and the public. The song after so much time has become annoying, but I still appreciate it by the phenomenon that is and this movie is. Only one problem, the usual problem of James Cameron, is the dialogue that is memorable, but in a bad way, as in how tacky it is in points, but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that takes you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart will not continue with this.
