This is a very good and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat that are taken to live with someone else for a while, but the animals do not understand and they escape and will find the family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and it lives up to its name. Chance is the youngest dog that knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is the oldest and wisest dog that feels things. Put the three together in an adventure and this contributes to a happy and fun time. There is no special effect of the mouths moving, so it is nothing fancy. It's the best talking animal film I've seen so far. It's a very good movie for families.
