The biggest Kasparov or Fischer games can be a mess for a total rookie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the clue! This is a private plot, built as a private company. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. As a conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, with no traces at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. Everything can be done only by delegation. The "director" should be just a trigger. If the normal viewer can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the film, a real plot is less likely to be discovered. All the performances of the actors are well done, with a special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
