Well, was Morgan Freeman more unusual than God than George Burns? This movie was certainly better than that "Oh, God". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the time. Carrey was perfect as an aspiring anchor, and Aniston did her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual performance. I, for example, do not consider her ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the file, thinking that she would never be able to keep her life story. See if you can identify the file in the cabinet that contains the mood events of your bathroom: I was going over it. Well written and even better, this comedy will fall as one of the best of this funny man.
