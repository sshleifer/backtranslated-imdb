Being a huge fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was very excited when I discovered that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life. I was not dissapointed. In fact, this movie far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for brave but not very satisfactory interpretations, but I am very happy to say that both managed to keep me captivated and believe the story as it happened. Moon Child has the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious and painful moments. I can not say that I've cried more in a movie and these more tender moments are admirably represented by the couple, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The fighting scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you're quick to get into the movie and start relating to the characters. I thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
