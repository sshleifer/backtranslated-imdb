Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I have the film for Hugo Weaving and watched it through to the end. It's one of those "drama of life" movies, as my mother used to call a movie that portrays a real-life story without extraordinary events and that is mainly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without much guilt, but without much merit. I longed for something like The Interview, or at least some element of matrix villain here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. History teaches us to face our own destiny and to free ourselves from the environment that others build for you, but this happens when the peach factory that gives life to the region is about to close, so it does not take much effort to change things. <br /> <br /> The "clever" sound of American Beauty sound in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but only that once after 100 minutes of film became annoying. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think he did his job of presenting a part of the Australian life, but for me it did not seem specifically Australian (could have been put anywhere) and did not look attractive as a story . <br /> <br /> I think you have to be in a way to like the movie.
