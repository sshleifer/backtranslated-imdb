One of my favorite movies that has been overlooked by many movie goers, an observation that mystifies me. Not only directed by acclaimed Ang Lee, he had many young actors who would become big stars, such as Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before the Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing. <br /> <br /> When the director's biographies and achievements (even when he won an Academy Award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from his past performances. I discovered the movie on DVD by accident and it became one of my most watched movies. However, it is rarely seen in cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons why this film is not well known.
