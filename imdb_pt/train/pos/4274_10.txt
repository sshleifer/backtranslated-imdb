I really like this movie, but it's a fact you can not understand, unless you're from former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are dead and these were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegowina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was former Yugoslavia, a cauldron of the Balkan nations. It could be a land of dreams if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists did not poison the mind of the nation with their unhealthy ideas.
