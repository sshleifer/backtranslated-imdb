Man On Fire tells the story of a former drink-dealing special forces agent who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard for a little girl in Mexico during a wave of ransom kidnappings. At first he is not friendly, but then they make friends with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc, etc ... then one day she is kidnapped ... and dead ... <br /> <br /> And He will not stop at anything to get revenge. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story of Man On Fire, but expect a few twists at least a few times, including the ending that is beautiful and will probably make you. This is also because of the great music that Harry-Gregson Williams composed with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait. The thing is that everything here is perfect. First - acting. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are as good as ever, the great Radtha Mitchell and the AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> So come the cinematography that is stunning and along with an excellent edition, should have won an Oscar for sure. <br /> <br /> History is not just a movie of revenge. The story is smart, the story makes you think ... and it's pure beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you need to see in your life, at least once!
