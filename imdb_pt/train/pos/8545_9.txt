Overall I found this movie quite entertaining and fun to watch, with lots of loud laughter moments. <br /> <br /> But this movie is not for everyone. That's why I raised this quick question - if you answer yes to any of the following questions than I recommend you watch this movie <br /> <br /> (1) Do you like gross sexual humor? (2) Do you like alcohol-related humor? (2) Do you like incredibly hot girls? (3) Do you like to see breasts? (4) Do you like to see several breasts? (5) Did I mention all the beautiful breasts in this movie? <br /> <br /> If you've noticed the spoiler alert, which is referring to the amount of mass nudity you can expect in the movie, I myself have no idea what the plot was about. Not that it matters.
