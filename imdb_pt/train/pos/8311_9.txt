I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classic singers, is very good at his job, when you see him in a music film, you know it will be good! I would suggest that people watch this thrilling, sad and special movie if they want to know more about Richard! Exceptional! Fresh!
