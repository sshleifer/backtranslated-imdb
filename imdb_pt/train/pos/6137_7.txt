What a great jewel this is. It's an unusual story that is fun to watch. Yes, it has singing, but it is very well worked on in history and it is very melodic to listen to. It was so nice to watch; I liked it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during World War II. It's about an apprentice witch who is looking for a lost portion of a spell she needs. She uses her crude "magic" to transport her and three children under her care to various destinations to find her. They are accompanied by their correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons of their school really work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects look a bit old-fashioned in the beginning, when you get used to them, they will become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and entertaining - and it's hard not to like the melodious songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think anyone of any age could find something to like this movie.
