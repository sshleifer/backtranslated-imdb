I think the opening 20 minutes of this movie is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed, with the brilliant soundtrack working to increase tension and reach a devastating climax. What movie goers did about it in the '30s, I can only imagine. The Times said at the time: 'A miracle has hit the screen.' Watch and marvel.
