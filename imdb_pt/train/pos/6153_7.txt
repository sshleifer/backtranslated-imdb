The obvious parallels between the charming Bedknobs and Broomsticks of Walt Disney and C. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are quite apparent. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins, although much of the same creative talent has entered the two Disney films. Like The Chronicles of Narnia, it involves some English children leaving London. during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And these kids have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis, the Rawlins boys have the magic of invading their world and helping to defeat the people who make a mess in the here and now. Not retreating to a fantasy realm like the Pevensie kids. <br /> <br /> No heavy philosophy here from Walt Disney, except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches, even apprentices like Angela Lansbury who learn the magic of a charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury was not one of the most fundable artists at all. It carries its own brand of magic that even the special effects that the Disney boys could not overcome. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this movie. <br /> <br /> Two artists said goodbye to movies in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her final role in this film, she has graced many films in the UK as one of her most beloved musicians. And that great actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the Old House Guard in war and songs, adieu to film audiences around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote the score for Mary Poppins, wrote a good and useful here. The Age of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Shaft theme. Personally, I like David Tomlinson's homage to the most colorful of London's streets, Portabello Road. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fantasy film that still holds after nearly 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.
