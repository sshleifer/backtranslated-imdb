My nanny was a fan, so I saw many of the older episodes growing up. I'm not a Scooby Doo fan, so I do not know why I left the TV on when the show debuted. To my surprise, I found it pleasant. To me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodge the tomatoes of other fans * so I like that they focus on just those two. However, this may cause fans of the original programs to hate you. I like dubbing, especially from Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked to hear it before I even knew it was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi it seems to me that he is really enjoying his work as an actor. I also have fun with the technicians with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or interpret Star Wars scenes (not called by those names in the program, of course).
