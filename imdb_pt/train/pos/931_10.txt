I like all versions of this story, but this is my all time favorite. George C.Scott gives a depth to the character Scrooge that others do not give. The film shows more about why it becomes so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents they show him. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim by far. He is of the right age, rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager, as in other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his milk teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. It portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity neither as a weak man shrunk under the Scrooges fool, but as a man who graciously accepts him because he has a family to support. Susannah York and the other actors do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen. Most of the time he is interpreted as a joyful Santa type character. In this he shows anger at Scrooges' attitudes and really makes Scrooge reconsider. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the scenery really give life to Dickens' London. A wonderful film.
