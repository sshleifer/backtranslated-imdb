In 2004, I saw "True", the contribution of Tom Tykwer to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and was thrilled. It became my favorite short film and made me really appreciate the format. Of course I wanted to watch the whole movie, and I would even check who was online, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the internet. <br /> <br /> Everything I should say looks amazing. The picture is BEAUTIFUL in all shorts and shots, at worst being nothing special - but still bright and clear. Later I read the trivia here, and maybe it's how the 6K digitization gives more justice to all DP work. My special favorites are the first scene "Qué de Seine" (that sunlight!), Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondissement" - but you know, what the hell like all of them: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still makes me nervous with these bright colors (my eyes tremble!) and "Quartier Latin" is gold stuck in silver. Pretty. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some beautiful short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's see the content. I very much (and I mean VERY) like eclecticism that is so successful. You've never had the same themes or treatment between two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to allow all these artists to explore beautiful and deep things inside the shorts. I loved to move from a simple love story to a crazy-Chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder into a social commentary in a horror comedy in a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's great that they have taken the chance to let all these directors show things that are not usual in mainstream cinema (which I come to despise a lot). It's not very experimental, but I can breathe the breathing space these people had. <br /> <br /> I like the little time and I love acting. I love simplicity and love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism and in general it is a movie that is very very good to see, alone or with someone. To simply feel. It made me feel so good. <br /> <br /> There's something about the seriousness about it ... it's so forthright ... <br /> <br /> What I did not like? Well, for me there are two shorts that are not exactly the best - "Which of Seine" (which is good-nature, of course, and maybe even necessary, but looks a lot like a commercial?) And "Père-Lachaise" love the performance, I felt that the themes were forced. But that, of course, is just me. "Tour Eiffel" I also did not love it, but I think it's probably because of my sensitivity very different from that of Sylvain Chomet? I do not know if this film has a special interest in people who already know the actor and the directors, and so they can delight in their interaction in surprises (look for Alexander Payne in a funny role) and basically in "what this director will do this? "great question. I really liked it that way. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: most of the shorts I loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix. I definitely recommend it. Definitely!!! So, watch out if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
