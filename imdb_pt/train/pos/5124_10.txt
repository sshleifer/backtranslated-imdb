This is a great movie that I do not think gets enough credit like Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but he's too piggy to admit his feelings for her. Instead, he wants to get involved in mechanical mounts because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even if it was done in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is great. 10/10
