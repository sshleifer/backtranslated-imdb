I think the movie was very good, will add it to my "classic collection" after all this time. I think I saw other posters that reminded some of the most demanding people that it's still just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points challenge "logic," but many religious matters accepted by "faith" do not pass the test of smell. If you will accept any faith you sign, you can certainly accept a movie. It's just me or someone else noticed that the Aja-Yee Dagger is the same knife owned by Lamonte Cranston had so much work to gain control in "The Shadow". No mention of this in the trivia section for any movie here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar on a donut is the same prop.
