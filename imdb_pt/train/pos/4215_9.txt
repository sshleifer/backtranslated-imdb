In this excellent film-noir of Twentieth-Century Fox, the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living one another. Urban landscapes fall upon insignificant humanity in the gloomy Expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> A prostitute took her purse from the subway. It contains a microfilm, and a Communist spy ring will do its best to retrieve it. Two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and police hunt down precious information. <br /> <br /> Anti-Skipper Skip McCoy is played with a scornful assurance from Richard Widmark. He knows that the cops are his inferior moral and intellectual equals, so he insults them: "Go ahead," he tells Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "carry a load. "In this ruthless world, cops are just another street gang. Like Candy, the prostitute bribes Lightning Louie to get a lead, so the police are busy paying pigeons for information. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when Widmark made this movie he was already in early middle age. . The 39-year-old, coming to the end of his contract with Fox, plays the rookie Skip McCoy with the impetuous irreverence of a teenager. Today, it may not be acceptable for the novel to take its love interest to unconsciousness, reviving it by pouring beer on its face, but by the customs of the period meant resistance - and Candy, after all, is a fallen woman. Jean Peters is radiant like Candy. Here, right in the middle of her five-year explosion at the B movies, she is beautiful and involved as the prostitute with the golden heart. She is the victim of history, a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else. It means well, but it's constantly being manipulated by cynical men - Joey, Skip, and the cops. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. Stunning urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living and malevolent force. Like worms in a rotten cheese, human figures run through the city's shortcuts. Elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks - even a dumb waiter works as a conduit for the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche that offers security: Moe has his room dirty and rented, Ignores his haunted cabin on the Hudson River. As the characters move and interact, they are framed by bridge architecture, or trusses of beams, or are divided by hanging tackle winch. The personality of the city is constantly imposing itself. The pier angles and cross beams are an echo of the grid street plan, and the index cabinets of cards in the boardroom mimic the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the subway is barred, it's as if the city's steel tendons are entangled. <br /> <br /> An amazing proportion of this film is filmed in extreme close-up. The character directs the plot as it should, and the close-ups are used to increase the character. When Skip interrogates Candy, the close-up captures the sexual energy between them, preventing the hostility of Skip's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted in light, in close-ups of soft focus. The device is also used to increase the voltage. The opening sequence, the bag, contains no dialogue: the drama depends entirely on the effect of near the powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Spies, and gossiping about gossiping, populate the film. Moe (Thelma Ritter) earns his living as an informant, and his place in the hierarchy is accepted even by his victims. When Skip remarks, "she has to eat," he's singing a recurring chorus. Just as "heterosexual" New Yorkers sell lamb chops or wood, the underworld traffick the commodity of information. <br /> <br /> And even the pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet in Moe's bed symbolize the transgression of the most basic moral code. Joey is beyond pale. Moe will not negotiate with Joey, even to preserve his life: "... even in our miserable business, you have to draw the line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "Pick-Up" was done in the depths of the Cold War. Richard Nixon had just been chosen as the Republican vice presidential candidate, having made his name with his fake communist microfilm exposed by Alger Hiss and all. The McCarthy trials were a daily reality. We see the cops in the film investing against "the traitors who gave the atomic bomb to Stalin." <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant receptacle in which frauds, squeaks and murders of human offal. Containers form a leitmotif throughout the film. Moe carries his registered box of ties, and the candy bag, microfilm container, is the engine of the plot. Skip keeps his unique possessions in a submerged crate, symbolizing his secret wisdom in the streets. The coffins of the homeless, descending the Hudson on a barge, are containers of just one more burden being shifted around the ruthless metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a composition masterpiece. Candy is shown above skulking. Jump into the fragile corridor of the hut, signifying your moral ascendancy. When the weapon is put on the table, the extreme outlook makes it appear larger than Candy - violence is beginning to diminish compassion. Lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore's hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but depends on the vagaries of the sinister city. Enlight the communist is a shadow on the wall or a cloud of cigarette smoke. He is like the lonely cat among the trash - a predatory ghost of the night. Photographs of cameras under the taxi's hoods, inside newspaper kiosks and through hospital beds constantly reinforce our awareness that we're all trapped in the metropolis. We are the cover of civilization.
