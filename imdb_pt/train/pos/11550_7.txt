If you delete the first twenty minutes or more from this movie, you'll end up with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still thought it was a very good movie, which is no small consideration considering the coma in which I was put through the opening scenes. To say the least, this movie has a dark beginning that was neither funny nor optimistic. Once things get more stupid, however, you get a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see your previous job.
