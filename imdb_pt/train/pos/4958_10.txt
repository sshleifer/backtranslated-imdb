Full disclosure: I'm a cynic. I like my sad end and my dry handkerchief. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith's new film, Happiness, looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar. Basically I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So, why the hell did I like "10 items or less?" Maybe it was the double espresso I drank before the show. Or (more likely) it was that even the most cinematic fans could use an occasional dose of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And sweet is. From the moment that "He" encounters "Scarlet" (a distant event from a Nora Ephron "meet cute"), the vision is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about the course of their lives. (Helped beautifully by Phedon Papamichael's cinema truth style camera work.) The main argument about the film is that it is too far-fetched. Is the movie far? I do not know. You tell me. I have not met Adrian Brody in the market yet. (However, not for lack of attempt). I like to consider the adventures that can occur if this important event occurs? Damn straight I do. . .which is where most "10 items or less" comments fall short. . . they can not take into account that even we, cynics, have fantasies. And sometimes it's worth the admission price to experience them indirectly, 82 minutes at a time.
