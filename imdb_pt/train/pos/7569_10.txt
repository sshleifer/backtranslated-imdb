At a time in our culture where the reality exposed as narrative is dominated by fiction as we know it on the screen and in the cinema, "Apart From That" is a film that exposes real-life moments that seem more honest, innovative and innovative in the presentation of what I've seen it before. The usual spoon feeding conventions are nonexistent in this movie, leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real-life moments pass one after another on the screen. While watching the movie, and even after contemplation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances are true performances. Every moment with the great cast of actors seemed the truth being exposed in their usual daily lives. Even so, "Apart From That" does not look like a documentary or reality show, but transcends into a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to seeing this new storytelling category continue with other films from directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen.
