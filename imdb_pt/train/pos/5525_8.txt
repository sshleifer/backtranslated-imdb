Much of the problem that many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining (ignore this is based on a true story) or complain about a movie that glorifies Che (which really does not). This film is very close to the definitive biography of Jon Anderson in Che and sets the story. Soderburgh does a great job of setting the mood for the unraveling disaster that was Che's Bolivian adventure. You really have the impression of the total shyness and perplexity of the Bolivian peasant with Che's revolutionary ideas or the difficulties his men face with hunger and terrain. Sorry to upset the fan of challenged attention movies out there, but that's how it happened. So do not go in this movie expecting a Rambo movie, it's a true story!
