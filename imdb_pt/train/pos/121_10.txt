Critics need to review what they classify as a quality movie. I think critics saw lots of action movies and succumbed to the Matrix style of the movies. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that the viewing is not enough to understand or enjoy this exceptional film. Lars von Trier shows that the old styles of filmmaking can produce a wonderful cinema and build drama and tension. The rear-projection effect he uses during the movie awakens and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses, such as color and black and white in a scene, such as Hitchcock and the girl in the red coat, draw attention and highlight the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again keeping focus on the central characters of the scene and actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk about the effects more, but I think everyone would agree that they push this movie into a category of their own, and really increase the drama of the movie. A movie to buy, if you do not already own it, and another to see if you did not. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this artistic noir movie from one of the great movie directors.
