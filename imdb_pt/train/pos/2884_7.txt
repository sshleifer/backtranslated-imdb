Of all the princess stories Disney has published, Cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal. I can not say why, but for some reason, generation after generation puts it at the top of their lists. As a girl, I wanted nothing more than being Cinderella in her crystal slipper - it was my absolute favorite outfit. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not think there is any story that notices more the yearnings of the human heart than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to escape the routine of everyday life and find someone who sees you like no one else has ever had? The story is older than English and somehow still true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is bad for the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not explicitly physical way. Her tongue and sharp eyes do the job for her - she does not need lighting sticks to cause fear in her heart. Animal friends tend to creak, especially that idiot Gus. I would have applauded if he had found his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was not impetuous, making some malicious remarks at times. However, she just did not have the drive to make her entirely friendly. Of course, she was cool and fed animals, but what kept her there? We never know. Even if she only becomes a maid in another house, at least she will be getting paid and will have a chance of respect. It seems that the only reason things work out in the end for Cindy is that everything falls into her lap. She never works for her dreams that she sings so lovingly. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to music, which is beautiful, as always. Ilene Woods has a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some great patterns originated here - a dream is a wish that your heart makes, so this is love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful honest story with a ton of musical highlights. Although lacking some character development, it provides some classic villains and excellent voice work. If you are feeling sick at heart, pop it on that will warm it up and make you hum Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: -Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy Birthday!
