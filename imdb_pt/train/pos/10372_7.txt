ROLL is a wonderful little film. Toby Malone plays an 18 year old boy (by the way, very well represented) who likes football. Malone's cousin takes him the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists involving two gymnastics bags, a drug dealer, some tough bikers, some cops and some prostitutes ... and the movie makes us guess which characters are in which side of the law, what is the content of any gym bag, and even the gender of a key rider is. Parts of it reminded me of STOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barris. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions I had before I saw ROLL. These reviews are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it seems such a cool place to spend a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers are Australians. The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive. I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian Women Are HOT!
