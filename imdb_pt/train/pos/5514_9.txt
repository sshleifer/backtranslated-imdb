I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two. Of course the two parts are in separate worlds, so I'm a little shaken by everything I've just seen. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; to me, clouded the entire movie. I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the inevitability of the evolution of his death. Part Two was so pessimistic compared to, again an inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The policy of the movement in Bolivia was only alluded to, but seldom confronted didaticamente. For me, the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the friendlier conversation with the Bolivian official, where the official questioned Che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I had not considered national differences playing either role or conflict, Argentine vs. Bolivian. I felt that Soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; How do you get food without antagonizing peasants who do not have enough? I was struck by how hard it would be to try something like Che tried. I think it's all in the timing; there is enough anger against the government to start the movement; in Bolivia there was not. Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, 50 years from now. A very thought-provoking and well-thought-out film; Strive to see it.
