Ossessione The debut film by Luchino Visconti, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement - well, it says so well in the back of the box - and is a sometimes penetrating portrait, sometimes lugubrious of solitary individuals in moral flow. Set in fascist Italy, a variety of supporting characters - including a naive soothsayer who defends the communist virtues - epitomizes the remote desperation of a country in search of its identity from the outside, drifting ghosts that long for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the underprivileged and his ability to express his unfortunate conditions were already well developed, the spider's web of deception is tenuous - although a staple of noir is postulating a protagonist manipulated by fate and femme fatale, Gino here it is so confusing to begin with that you fear it deserves it - the cosmic irony is also didactic, the illicit relationship is tense with the batho. Yet it is incisive and essential, though its real impact on film history is certainly debatable.
