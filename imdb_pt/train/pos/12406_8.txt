A long-overdue prison, closed for more than 20 years, is reopened and Ethan Sharpe (the late character actor, Lane Smith), once a guard there, is placed as a director. When the prisoners are put to work by repairing the place, they are instructed to invade the former execution room. This triggers a fierce spirit that causes ruthless destruction on guards and prisoners; The discreet discreet prisoner Burke (Viggo Mortensen, showing a real posture in an early role) is pushed into the role of hero. <br /> <br /> I know it's obvious to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was filmed in a real abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror movie to a higher level. It has a great feeling, set early on. Director Renny Harlin did his fourth directing job here; he landed the directing show for "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and effectively began an impressive career in action movies, thrillers and horror films. <br /> <br /> It may have stock characters, but it has a capable cast bringing them to life: Chelsea Field as the young woman struggling for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as the tired veteran Cresus, Tom Everett as tireless Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as the Tiny Speak Giant, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It's also noteworthy as a credit to Kane Hodder (like the vengeful spirit) that helped him get the role of playing Jason Voorhees in the "Friday the 13th" series. <br /> <br /> Decent special effects, moody lighting courtesy of prolific cinematographer Mac Ahlberg, scary music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone, great visuals, incredibly gloomy venue, and a flashy, intense presentation help make it a lot of fun . It's nasty, horrible and fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
