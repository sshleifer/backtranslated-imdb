Okay, let's face it. This is a horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is horrible, acting worse. But the film was made for a reason and a single reason, like all those horrible films of Mario Lanza ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in its heyday. Okay, so maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit women, but this movie is about listening to Luciano. That's all worth watching the movie. A great opera star stuck in himself faces his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and sings many success numbers as well. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have prejudice on several levels. . I'm Italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (is there anything about Pavarotti that's not great, including his fan base?). And when I first saw this movie, I was going out alone, seeing the height and depth of Life's possibilities and loving it for the first time. As horrible as this movie is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deeply into life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's cheesy and horrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is everything. So I give this movie a high note in the hope that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he's gone. Like Italian food you have never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep.
