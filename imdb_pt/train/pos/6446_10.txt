"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I have ever seen in my life. That did not win the Oscar, I will not shed a tear. This film is in a kind of class itself, which an Oscar win would have possibly impaired !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made a real magnificence with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation, and everyone contributing, you all gave a gift of Love to our world. Between the points of entering this our world, then coming out - you can really say you did better! A special personal thanks from my soul to all of you, that you brought back some precious memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and present Beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to all of you. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
