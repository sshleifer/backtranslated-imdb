A deforce tour! OK, the kid who plays Oliver is a little too sweet! Starting with the great cinematography, colors, costumes and most impressive performances, this is a must-see movie. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one is above all and it is a musical to begin with! He is a masterful Fagan, never leaving his character to make a song. You never know whether you like him or not, the same feeling I have in the book. In other versions, you hate him from beginning to end. Bill Sykes ... when you read the book, he's a villain, and so he's in that movie. Oliver Reed was a master. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his last film, Gladiator based on his great performances, not to see the headliners. Music fits in the moments and the weather. Who's going to buy this beautiful movie? You must!
