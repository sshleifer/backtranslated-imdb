There is no trash - no where even near garbage. Is not it an original? this is the last thing that could be said of "2.4 children". Predictable? certainly not! Although it was a rather unusual series for the BBC, it was hilarious, funny and witty. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - which I believe to have formed wonderfully. Gary Olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members. I was never completely new because I was canselado until I read here today about the death of Gary Olsen a relatively young age. I wish they would do more such comedies, much more of them (and show them here in Israel).
