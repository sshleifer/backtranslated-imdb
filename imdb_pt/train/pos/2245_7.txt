Salva and his friend Bigardo have been on the sidelines for most of their lives. We see them begging in a basement car, where their pitch for donations is so bad that no one gives them anything! Salva, a hardened petty criminal, does not even have redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality television show that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Savings capitalizes on. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were arrested after the accidental death of a priest who criticized the pair. Salva shows that he is natural to the reality show. He becomes a Christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a sensible woman and a producer of shows, can not escape the way Salva pays his unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva falls victim to his own success in the end. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first job as director of this movie is, has had some success in how the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, saw its share of the bizarre, which is what the director considered an attack on the public and wanted to define its history from the point of view of people who are making a fortune out of the naive audience . <br /> <br /> The cast has some good moments in the movie. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature film, would have been more effective focusing on the photo in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Giménez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the others responded well to the new director.
