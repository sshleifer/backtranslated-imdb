I looked at this movie with my child's eyes, and I was not disappointed. The story is well known, some abandoned orphans have to be brought to their parents by an unlikely trio (mamooth-sabertooth tiger and a lazy beast) ... And I do not want to forget to mention the incredible little pet of fury with his hazenut. This really made me laugh a lot throughout the scene. <br /> <br /> Briefly: it works, it's funny and it's a "must-see" with your kids (they'll like it).
