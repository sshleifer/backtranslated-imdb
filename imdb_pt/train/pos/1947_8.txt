SPOILERS Like other posters, I felt the ending was a bit abrupt. I wish I had seen the crew adapt to life on Earth upon their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by "frontally loading" some sequences of Voyager on Earth at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that timeline has been eradicated, so it's all debatable.) I liked how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we can have our cake and eat it, making Janeway make the best sacrifice and live. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self having conversations were bizarre and could so easily have crossed the line to camp. Luckily, Mulgrew did it.
