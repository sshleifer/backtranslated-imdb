I love this movie so much! The animation is great (for a pokémon movie), the cgi looks so amazing. I love the music of the movie. So great that they kept the Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story: it's great. You have a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokémon. Ash is very good in this movie, and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like was the appearance of Suicune, it suddenly pops up, helps the Ash & co a little and leaves. They could have done their part in the movie a little bigger. <br /> <br /> But overall, amazing movie! Can not wait to have the USA version on DVD!
