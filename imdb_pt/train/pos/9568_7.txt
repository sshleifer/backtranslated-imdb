Some comments here on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III movies of the 1990s, but despite being undoubtedly brutal, violent and very pessimistic, this Pou-Soi Cheang movie is not really despicable, shocking or sensationalist win this comparison. However, it's still a scam that makes it worth watching, especially if your action is tough and tough. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian gunslinger who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate a judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless police officer who is determined to locate him, whatever the cost. With Wai approaching his target, Pang will not hesitate to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, an illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape his life of abuse. <br /> <br /> A relentlessly tough drama with outstanding cinematography, incredible sound design, an astonishing soundtrack and solid performances of Chen and Lee (as well as the newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Dog Dog is a fan of blunt Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of the Vengeance trilogy of Chan-wook Park). Shotguns, shootings, ruthless beatings: they all happen regularly in this film and are firmly picked up by director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the kind of story that is destined to have an unfortunate ending for everyone involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this movie dies (pretty nasty deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a ridiculously super-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant. Eventually, after all three had been severely stabbed during the fight, a wounded Pang makes a Ceasarean DIY (Yain dead) moments before he dies. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong's excess, with its delusingly OTT action and sleek look, it's still worth looking for.
