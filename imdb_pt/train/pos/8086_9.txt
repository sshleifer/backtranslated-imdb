I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after seeing the FANTASTIC 2001 live action version of the movie. The live action trilogy of The Lord of the Rings directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be far better than George Lucas's "Star Wars Episode 1-3" trilogy as the true 21st century fantasy series ! <Br /> <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I did not quite understand the depth of the movie at that time. Now that I've read the books, I understand what the whole story is. To be sure, some of the characters are pretty silly, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode 1, (AWFUL!)), But I have to say that he follows the book closely, and enters part of book Two, The Two Towers. The good things are that the action is a bit interesting and some of the animations are quite remarkable for their time. The bad things are that it ends abruptly in the middle of the Two Towers, with no result of Frodo's quest to destroy the single ring, and the animation seems quite old-fashioned compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not as bad as many say. BUT, the live action version of 2001 is the brand new Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn led him to create one of the greatest fantasy series of all time, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I'll take the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on the live version of Harry Potter on any given day! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1-10, much less violent than the live action version of 2001, but NEVER approaches as well! For the stubborn fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
