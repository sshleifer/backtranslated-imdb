The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not-so-honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns and money. Some would say that this is the tragic history of America in the Excessive Eighties, where the rise of peace and free love of the sixties had clashed with drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just ordinary people with no purpose in life, who sit around and decide to steal a ruthless man. What is the second part of your master plan? Once they have their things ... they will sit and rise again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this movie nor surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folkloric heroes of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of his items, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a more direct approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of little drug dealers getting killed by big drug dealers. The biggest story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the only one in Wonderland, with wonders about to disappear. <br /> <br /> Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' life. It is not entirely factual, but it is much more enjoyable.
