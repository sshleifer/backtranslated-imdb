I saw this on a flight to the US and was a little skeptical at first, as some people said there were so many characters in that you did not get to know any of them. However, I did not find this at all. The film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are great and yes, it can be predictable, but it's not true in most movies. The main villain is a bit disappointed, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but said it's still a good movie.
