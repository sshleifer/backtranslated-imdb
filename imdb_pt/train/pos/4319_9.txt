In the second screening of this movie, I like it more than the first time. It is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful, but what brings this film to a rarely perceived height is its focus on the small incidents in our lives to which we usually only give the briefest period of attention. Here the film turns to the celebration of these incidents, the meeting of a tow truck driver and customer, the hallway listening to the cry of a baby from the bushes. The dialogue, acting, cast and direction are excellent. There are not two of four, without great revelations. What I observed was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how their lives became better when they were celebrated. Lots of compliments to everyone involved in this, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
