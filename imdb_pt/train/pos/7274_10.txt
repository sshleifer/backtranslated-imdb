In Strings Attached is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia to this day. Mencia is known for nudging and making fun of racial issues. However, it does more than that in this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. Overall, Mencia's material not only makes you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today. <br /> <br /> At this time of long presentation, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when they demand equality in the workplace, terrorism, their views on Mel Gibson's Passion for Christ and an argument with which he became involved with a woman about whether he is affected by Jesus, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally deficient. Mencia even discusses whether or not one should have the right to speak and tell a joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid of offending, which often causes him problems with his critics. For example, he goes a little far (and he admits) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he is probably doing in heaven now. <br /> <br /> The main message of Mencia in all his performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. It reminds us that we have the right to freedom of expression and that we should use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, your show at Comedy Central.
