My interest was raised while I was browsing and I saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia so I thought OK, let's see what this is. I'm so glad I stayed on the canal. What a wonderful and wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some acting up, but a wonderful moment to have. I watch this and it makes me sad for all the nonsense that the film industry throws and these beautiful precious things are ignored. Give Iphigenia a try and hope you like it as much as I do. I even got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy. It starts slowly, however, the drama builds and you will be drawn to the story. Watching this lovely film made me want to get caught up in more tragedies and Greek ducks.
