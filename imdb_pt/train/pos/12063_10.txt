The Woman in Black (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's classic modern ghost story, published a few years before the movie was made. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD, and as far as I know, it was deleted on VHS. Its availability is in direct contrast to the popularity among those who have knowledge about horror films. The story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young lawyer is sent by his company to complete the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on his isolated marsh property. What he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare when he discovers that the old woman was haunted to death, and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, never being self-indulgent, flashy or exaggerated. The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the practical approach, but it is exactly what history needs and why it works so well. It's what you do not see that scares. That said, there is a particularly terrifying scene that depends on the visual and works perfectly. I watched this movie during the day, and it still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you love being terrified, do what you must to get a copy of The Woman In Black.
