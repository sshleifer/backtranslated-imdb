Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun .... I was lucky enough to see the movie during your brief theatrical passage. The audience laughed. I'm watching his tape while typing and it's still funny! <br /> <br /> It also has a sweet side, with unexpected twists of genuine ducks. The late and great Royal Dano is especially effective as the solitary and awkward Wrenchmuller farmer. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as the top boys. And the actors of the Martian costumes, although limited to mimicry, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for are the details of the background. The film is full of honors, pastiches and references to other science fiction and fantasy films. Take a look at the Martian costumes next time. One is wearing a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in a Atreides House uniform, and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter training suit.
