Paris is the ideal place to enjoy fine art and music and fall madly in love - as is the case in this film. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, but something is in the way of eternal happiness, the classic story. <br /> <br /> The wonderful music of George Gerschwin complements the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "An American in Paris" is a loving, humorous and cheerful film that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
