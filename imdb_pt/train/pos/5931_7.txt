Although written by Stephen King, an overrated writer, if there is any, this is actually very fun movie B. Incestuous and vampiric creatures who live in the house by candlelight and drain the life force of the virgins, a great graveyard setting , heroic cats and a very beautiful virgin. The soundtrack even has Enya's music, an idea I found quite ... cool. I'm sure King is disappointed in this little movie, although it has bad dialogues and ideas, all of them from a real, tedious King potboiler. (Although sleepwalkers, if I get it right, it's a screenplay without any novel or tale behind). Still, these touches of sewage odors show that he did NOT use a ghostwriter after all ...
