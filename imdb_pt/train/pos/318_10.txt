This is undoubtedly the biggest movie ever made. It is almost incomprehensible, even with many repeated views, in an attempt to find out exactly what is happening. The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests that sign up by mail and a host of other innovations. Also, what other movies have cameos by Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the movie, look for the director's book titled I was curious. Everything will be clear. It is a great and daring experience in improvised recursive films. A triumph. Now if only someone would release a version with the captions in a color * other * than white ... the blank captions tend to disappear and become invisible.
