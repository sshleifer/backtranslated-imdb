A great idea: 11 stories about September 11th. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talking about an immigrant (as always) is simply brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman also does a very good job, while the Burkina Faso film was a good surprise. However, the Israeli movie was a bit boring, and the Mexican, well, he should stop driving and working at a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
