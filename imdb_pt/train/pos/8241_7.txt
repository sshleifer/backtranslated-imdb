Fido is a very strange movie. And in many ways, a very good one. <br /> <br /> My first thought after seeing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story mixed with fifty nostalgia comedy with zombies. It does not leave the language exactly. <br /> <br /> Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, laughter and giggling. It's a different beast (forgive the pun). Fido begins with a black and white information film that explains the story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subjugates meat eaters into idiot servants. <br /> <br /> At first I thought we were in a parody of cold war parody 50's à la Matinée, but soon we are cast into a world of bright primary colors and fifty years of first-class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The young Timmy Robinon is a lonely boy who does not fit the school. His mother is an aspiring social climber, and his father is nervous and detached. Looking to keep up with the Joneses, the mother (Carry-Anne Moss) got a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) soon turns out to be a close friend to Jimmy. Until his collar flashes ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the film is finding out exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Humor is of the light variety of the family and sometimes the plot is very dependent on the boy and his puppy / family moments. <br /> <br /> However, the film is filmed with wonderfully dark and truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for long periods, a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie looks wonderful, and it's wonderfully accomplished by all involved. <br /> <br /> its difficult tonal problems, I hope this film finds a niche, since it is a little jewel in this year's film deluge.
