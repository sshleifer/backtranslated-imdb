I loved this movie, and I'm one of the older people who should not like it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These kinds of movies never are. But strangely, there is a message in it. It is that each of us has the potential to be whatever we want. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought she bears some resemblance to Katharine Hepburn. So it's great to see that both Hepburn and Posey made films about librarians (Hepburn's is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 8. It's not at all a great movie for film standards, although there are some cool scenes in it. But it is incredibly charming and fun.
