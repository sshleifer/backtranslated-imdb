I kind of consider myself the # 1 fan of the Hidden Frontier, since I'm among a small group of fans who really knew most of these guys - well, not counting the conventions, of course. I've been watching Hidden Frontier since 2001, and I have to say I'm still impressed by what these guys have created. <br /> <br /> The Hidden Frontier is a creation of Rob Caves and his self-made studio, Areakt Pictures, which operates in the back room of his house. Although not as "fancy" as, say, the New Voyages series (which sometimes hosts some of the actors / writers of the original series, such as Walter Koenig, also known as Chekov), Rob and the HF cast and crew. series worthy of replacing that dreadful experiment we call "Enterprise." The most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of Star Trek's first openly gay character, Corey Aster (who was featured in Season 2), and his quest to find a soul mate. At some point later, he meets Jorian Zen, the Excelsior Trill officer. In the recent lines of the story with these two characters, Zen joins an exiled symbiote, causing a major change and some conflict in his relationship with Aster. Although the future is uncertain - since the latest episode, "Beachhead," was shown to HF fans in the chat room last night - I think this relationship will last, but only time will tell. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry has created Star Trek with the intention of letting the story be more about its characters rather than flashy space battles. Rob Caves created the Hidden Frontier for the same reason - and that's what made this series so popular. As the previous comment stated, I would like to be able to give a rating higher than 10, but that will have to be enough. Although next season is the last - keeping the tradition of the seven shows of the season Star Trek: The Next Generation - I'm willing to bet we'll hear a lot about the Hidden Frontier after the final episode.
