Anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I look like a middle to the late 70's Ford. This movie is my favorite, as is my wife's. It was the first memorable film we saw as a couple. The pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and I recently found another like it. I'd like to restore the pick up that I have to look like in the movie. Also the music was amazing, and the acting was great. Where and which one did you portray John's aunt? John also had a stunt double for the scene in the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang Debra W drove in this show. It looked like a 1960s model. Thank you,
