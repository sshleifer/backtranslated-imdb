I saw this movie on DVD yesterday and was shocked and amazed. The unaffected performance of DDL just surprised me, and I was amazed at the whole cast and its outstanding acting. The whole character was so authentic to me that I actually took DDL to Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker to her mother. Go and see! You will cry your heart, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you an important lesson: Determination is everything. You may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you're stubborn enough, you will have no problems. If you can only operate your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you have mental problems is to indulge in self-pity. It will not get you anywhere and the only person who will pity you will be yourself.
