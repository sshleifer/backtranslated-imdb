I just watched "The Last Wave" at my school's arts library. It's intriguing, like all of Peter Weir's things, but it's not always as interesting as I'd like. I was fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the director of the film Weir), but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I got a little bored at some points. <br /> <br /> The plot involves an Australian lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams that he has that bind him to a group of Aborigines he is defending. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense climatic sequence and has some very impressive mood effects (mainly bizarre sound design, belching) and strong steering; but it simply did not entertain me as Weir's later films do. I just need to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Good movie about obsession and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery that exists between whites and Aborigines offers some very severe consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless Peter Weir. Just for him this movie is worth watching ... very organic director. Like an Australian answer Malick! I would give a 7 because he has enough great ideas to overcome his boring moments.
