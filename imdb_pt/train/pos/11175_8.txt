Often, with the adaptations of Stephen King, you have just received a collection of characters reciting the dialogue of the books. This really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they DO NOT use large parts of the text straight from the book, but it's a bit more offhand from the events of the story. A big part of his success is Miko Hughes as Baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really act like their parents. There is a scene where Louis is hugging Gage and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL. He sings the Maine accent perfectly without parody, and is wise and warm as Jud should be. (8 out of 10)
