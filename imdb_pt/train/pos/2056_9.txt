I do not think most people give this film as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes, the Scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighter, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. I really did not have much fun watching a movie since Candyman. So the city chooses this kid calling him a scarecrow, even his mother does not care about him. Then he is dead and the spirit is infused into the Scarecrow, which then goes on a kill. His death is relatively easy to take on when the movie begins. The dedications at the end go straight to a group of horror directors, but with a lot of dedication to Dario Argento it really struck me as cool, these people who want to make movies of a younger genre. About the movie has a lot of Arnold's features, with a liner you'll definitely laugh like you're around and he kills the sheriff with a piece of wood. I'd say, get some pizza with some friends and have a laugh with that movie. I love it for its originality, more fun.
