Having never seen this movie, based on Nicholas Katzenbach's entertaining novel, and taking into account the first cast of production fee, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause," although not a horrible movie, takes many liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart was unsuccessful in his treatment. Arne Glimcher drove. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think of when a young black man is taken to the local arena for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy by beating Bobby Earl, accused of killing a white girl. We are horrified at what the cops do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. The old woman is convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man serving time at Bobby Earl's facility, introduces himself to tell how he is connected to her murder and changes the dynamics of the case. The way he plays in the movie, serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is made fun by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a good impression as the sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film, even with its flaws, will not disappoint.
