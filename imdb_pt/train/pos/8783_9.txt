Gentleman Jim is not really a boxing movie. It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. But having said that, the boxing scenes are a real eye opener for the modern viewer. There is no 12 round decision here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the official of the Irish bank who gets a chance for the world heavyweight title. Flynn is well suited for Corbett's soft but unpredictable role. His opponent John Sullivan is still better, however, an old-school brute played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the movie is a man who is pushing for his big break. Corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new person as Gentleman Jim. Jim is a cantor who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and a selfish one. Sullivan, the heavyweight boxing champion, is portrayed as a mere brute, but his honesty and sportsmanship give a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> There is action and enthusiasm aplenty and a wonderful ending with the redemption necessary for all. And Errol Flynn stays with the girl.
