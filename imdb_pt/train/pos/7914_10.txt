I probably saw this movie first in 1995. Since then, I've been back to it several times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Wow!! This was so cool in the glory days of CG animation. CG is a lot older than me because I know the movie "Tron" was made seven years before my time. But this movie was a milestone in the early 1990s. It was probably the first collaboration of different computer graphics experiments in music. I like it so much, I think I'll watch it now. Goodbye
