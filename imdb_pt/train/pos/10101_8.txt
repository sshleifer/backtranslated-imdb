Domain tanks police is an exercise in producing contradictory films. The plot through the 4 parts combines stupid action, slap humor, touching humanity and thinking provoking philosophical issues. It's hard to believe there was only one director, since the style changes from episode to episode. An unforgettable movie for those who like anime.
