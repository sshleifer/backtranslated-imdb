What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie I saw the other night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double counts but kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. The husband has a pier fall and the only way to be saved is if Barbara goes to a garage to pick up a rope. While there she meets a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse, while Barbara tries everything to get Meeker back with her to free the husband. <br /> <br /> The movie was so full of suspense and a surprise - I was not expecting such a good movie. But I suppose I should have realized - is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does that is anything but wonderful?
