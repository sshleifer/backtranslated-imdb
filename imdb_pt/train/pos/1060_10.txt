Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy Love in the Ruins - depicting the not-too-distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once swallowed the premise that all modern technology can be paralyzed by the "Pulse", it provides a fun landscape to explore the personalities and relationships between the two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / Bike Messenger) and Logan ( the rich rebel). It seems unequal, perhaps the result of a variety of authors, but it is held together by the energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who seems strong and calloused but vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
