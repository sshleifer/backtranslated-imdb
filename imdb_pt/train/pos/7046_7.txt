At War, Inc, we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities we are doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you're familiar with the wiles of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root, and Blackwater abroad, you're already halfway there to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's last piece. Cusack plays a corporate salesman named Brand Hauser, who is in Turiquistan organizing a fair in the newly released country as a cloak while waiting to gain access to his newest target. There he is intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter interpreted by Marisa Tomei and pursued by super-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hauser's past, which includes a haunting tragedy since then and the corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon, who is actually commanding the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played properly on top, they are not always the moments you expect and the little touches often surprise you. All directors turn into solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but on the other hand, she does a great job and helps dissipate her image of Disney. Tomei is funny but discreet, while the Cusack have almost every scene they are in. To be fair, they get good stuff. Writers deliver a good script with enough twists and turns to keep you laughing all the way to predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that prevents me from classifying it higher as history contorts and transforms its way to the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your broad and physical comedy, there probably is not enough here to keep you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like squeamish comedy and broad satire, this is for you.
