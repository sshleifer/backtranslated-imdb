This documentary was very complete and exposing, and at the same time amusing, what I found quite impressive. I felt like they did a good job covering the sport from its origin to the present day, but nevertheless, there is a reason why I do not give such a high note to this movie ... I felt as if sometimes the story was too focused on the "proper names" of sport, so to speak: too much in individual places where to surf, and especially in individual surfers. I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc. It would have been better (though of course it was covered, I do not think it took as long as it might have). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely crazy about surfing, they sometimes hear them talking about specific locations and specific surfers can become boring. Although video clips and in-depth research are well respected, they could have been presented in a way that would be best for those who are not avid for surfers. <br /> <br /> In addition, my biggest disappointment was at times they talked about how some amazing and miraculous events in surfing history still did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding, and the whole time you're waiting to see on the silver screen this incredible, breathtaking event, these men are talking about how life-changing moments, and in the end all you have is a lot of men talking about it, not the actual footage. It was very tempting for me to even hear those stories, and then be unable to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting pictures of everything, but please: do not gabe so much of an event, and then do not show. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very new documentary that I enjoyed watching; is not the best documentary due to the above reasons but being very new and having some extremely exciting scenes and a good soundtrack is a documentary that I advise everyone to check out.
