I just read the latest comments about this movie and would like to respond. you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group N.W.A. which dates back to the beginning in 1988 in 1989, the ice cube left the band to go solo and finally in 1991 the band split up when Dr.dre left. which led to a lot of meat starting with the exit of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. This story was somewhat based on that. <br /> <br /> even more this movie was a laughing binge 90 minutes the way They explained that the music of the suck juice to be a political statement was hilarious. not to mention the tasty "love song" was connecting. and when the vanilla sherbert got his butt kicked out, just as the record company executive is also hilarious and having his managers shot every time too. <br /> <br /> People who did not like this movie probably did not. get it or were complete idiots, my opinion
