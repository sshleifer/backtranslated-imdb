The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her things in this year-end comedy (1928) that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies is a Georgia hick, who hits Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lampoon in Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (sorry they never did a talkie together) and the guests of such films as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (you have to see this is a joke A must for any serious movie fan or anyone interested in the yet defamed Marion Davies!
