Suggesting Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use some therapy, to say the least. In Dig! who won the Sundance Jury Grand Prix, watched him and his band self-sabotage for seven years while former friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols achieve comparative greatness (at least one ad). <br /> /> What lifts Dig! above their contemporaries, is the immense, almost Biblical, comic tragedy being staged: a depressing and honest treatise on art versus trade and compromise. For all his "look at me, I'm a bloody genius," Newcombe is indeed revealed as a singularly talented, yet immensely disturbed musician - far more talented than his rival, Dandy Courtney Taylor, who narrates the scene. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, Taylor. <br /> <br /> Even sad, Taylor seems to realize this, evidenced by his tired, self-loathing voice: he knows that his band won the battle - but at what cost? In fact, they sold out, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth clean and beautiful, and probably brushed their hair twice before bed - thus earning record contracts and a big tour bus. And discarding all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in filth, is continually arrested, beats up other members of the band on stage, kicks up heads - and is last seen on Dig! being transported by the police, having lost the right to see his son. <br /> <br /> Two of the best rock subculture films were directed by women: Penelope Spheeris's Decline of Western Civilization, and this one? an instant classic at the time it was released.
