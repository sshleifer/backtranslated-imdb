I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would have probably lost that movie if I had not chosen Air Canada. I watched on a small screen in the back of the front seat, I found this captivating and mesmerizing. I did drift in some places and had to jump back, but I had to watch his end. Now I'm looking forward to the release of the DVD in Europe, although I'm so paralyzed when I can walk out the door, it has not yet been discovered! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is impressive and the film gives as much discernment and 'fills' the story as the photos tell. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
