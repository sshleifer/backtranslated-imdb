Ride With The Devil, directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger), is another jewel in this beautiful cap of directors. For those unfamiliar with the history of the Kansas-Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. In addition to some superb action scenes (quite bloody at times). This is a story of love and devotion between men and a lady in particular. Starring Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich and Jeffrey Wright as the young lady Jewel, I've never heard or seen her before, I want to see more of her). The acting is top notch, excellent production values, very well written (adapted from a novel) <br /> <br /> This is a long movie of 128 minutes, but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> respected <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
