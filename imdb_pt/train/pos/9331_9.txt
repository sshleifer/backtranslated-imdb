This movie was last week and although at this time of day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I could not turn off the TV. The story about Madelene Moore really touches you. She does not appear as a very nice character at first, but seeing the whole movie, you just want her to succeed. This movie really leaves you thinking. And I think, basically due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of it before, nor knew it in another movie, but this was a great performance. Best regards to Brooke. I hope to see you in another movie soon.
