Despite success in comedy or drama, Turkish directors are a failure in the horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples for the horrifying Turkish horror films. <br /> <br /> But if you watch "Gen", you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and somber. Also the special features are colorful and are not cheap. The soundtracks fit the film, but the script is not totally perfect and the movie theme is common. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint. suspense fans. In this respect, it is a success for Yesilcam and for Turkey. (7/10)
