The movie Titanic makes much more than just a "night to remember". He writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never be forgotten. Why so much criticized? I have no idea. Could they make a movie like Titanic, which is so touching and touching every time you watch it? Could they replace such an epic masterpiece? It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director undoubtedly had the biggest impact on the film. A simple (boring to watch) disaster film turned into an unbelievable novel. Yes, I'm not a Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you'll never see a romance like that. Guaranteed! All for the amazing effects, for the music, for the sublime performance. <br /> <br /> The film creates an incredible visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything seems very real and alive. The legend "TITANIC" itself is shown brilliantly in all classes, it also seems, very accommodating. The performance was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason the movie is so good. <br /> <br /> I think it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, the performance is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more than half of the consumers who watch the movie will share tears, thanks to an unimaginable end that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this movie yet, you're missing something from Hesterical and a movie to idolize in Hollywood. Could it get better? No way. The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself, then you will understand. A reference point. (do not be surprised if you cry too)
