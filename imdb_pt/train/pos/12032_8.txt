The film I'm going to review is a small television movie made in 1996 and starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager. who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex-boyfriend named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Been Kissed"), they instantly "fall" for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to lead their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect her "love", but she only used it to get rid of her parents so she could be with Brad (David Lascher's future companion, 'Sabrina' for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role of evil manipulator and she carries the film well using her friends and Nick so she can literally escape with the murder. The rest of the support cast works well and each one of them holds when it has screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began to portray Sabrina the Teenage Witch and it shows that she can act in my genres of film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the film has dated a bit that still stands out as some of its best work involving drama or suspense and I look forward to 'Nine Dead' coming out in November because it shows that it can be seen as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.You can watch this on the internet, so I suggest take a look.
