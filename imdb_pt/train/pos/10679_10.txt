The man about the house is a true comedy of situation in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character named Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan), who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two ladies named Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was held to say goodbye to his former apartment colleague. The obvious ends up happening when he enters. The man over the house was a pre-cursor for George and Mildred, who showed the two characters who owned Jo, Chrissy, and Robin. These two characters would end up being the pillars of the man at home, with Mildred (the late and very longing Yootha Joyce), in particular, receiving some of the best lines in the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless person who was always in the trash and only showed up when he wanted to borrow something (and never return it). <br /> <br /> The American made a version called company three, but has no chance when compared to this much funnier original. The Thames risked producing a comedy about a man sharing an apartment with two women at a very conservative time, but they should be concerned, because the ratings of the time suggest that about 20 million people just wanted to watch a good and old comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. Too bad that modern comedy can not reach this high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the DVD network
