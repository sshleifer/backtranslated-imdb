"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thoughtful film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched that movie late at night, excited about what was to come. I was not dissapointed. At the end of the movie, I was impressed. I could not get it out of my mind. The whole idea just surprised me. The ending was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could do. The plot was also something that kept me interesting altogether. The cast, superb. It was a wonderful film. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I'm always finding something new. It's a movie to keep you interested forever.
