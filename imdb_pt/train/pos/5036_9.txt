Bill Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, amazes me with his debut as director of Frailty. He hits all the cylinders, but there's an implausibility near the end involving the FBI agent (Powers Booth), who deducts a point from this otherwise creepy and thought-provoking thriller. Other than that, this movie went very well. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays the father. He never gave a first name, but this is not a weakness of the film. In fact, it strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see it as a kind of symbol of some kind. He has a vision one day that he says he was sent from God saying that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) must fine the demons and kill them . The demons look like normal people they kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if Daddy has just gone mad or he is actually doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points, which adds to the confusion and gives more suspense to the film. The story is told in flashback by one of the now-grown kids (Matthew McConaughey) and is talking to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth), who is very skeptical and rightly so. After all, it is not every day that someone comes to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The film has many twists and turns, and Bill Paxton drives splendidly by preventing us from losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leaders and Paxton work together, looking like a normal family, even though everyone is involved in murders. As I said, there is an implausibility involving the character of Powers Booth, but it really is not a big deal. This was an extremely well done film involving faith and family.
