Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen at least a hundred times and I can not go without crying. I challenge anyone to attend the meeting of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and Dad and not feel their eyes foggy. Whoopie Goldberg should have a prize for incredible portraits. And for the person who said you can not love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I am proof of that.
