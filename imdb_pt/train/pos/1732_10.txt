"Sandra, the making of a woman" is a highlight among the exploration films, and it is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent, yet effortless, performance by Monica Gayle and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was in charge of the project. These two talents, both very underestimated, make of Sandra a film that must be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the success of the film is its realism - there is nothing false or "Hollywood". about this movie set-in-California. It truly is a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses used by the character, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart jumping in the front door and Sandra sitting on the sofa without makeup. while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, looking really as if she's just woken up (but still pretty), the harmless weird Sandra picks up who likes to make love to her while he wears a bra, the one bedroom apartment in which Sandra moves - all these elements of the film seem totally real, and as such, the viewer is attracted to Sandra's little world from the start and immediately cares about her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also defends free love with eloquence and dignity, and she leaves with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This film could have easily failed in less competent hands, and could have gone away in either case. Usual sexploitation directions, but the Garver / Gale team make that "Sandra" is not only the creation of a woman but the achievement of an excellent film.
