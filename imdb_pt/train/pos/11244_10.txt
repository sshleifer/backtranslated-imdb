One of my best films of all time, maybe because I was fine on the punk scene in the late 70's and went to a lot of hazel concerts but the movie was a good story and very good interpretation of hazel and Phil Daniels not sure about your latest project, Eastenders !! excellent performance by many unknown actors that if you keep your eyes open you will see them on many of the UK soaps today exp: Carver off the Bill, the more I watch, the more I see, well, if you have not seen yet have a night with the video, do not forget to unearth the safety pin to the nose and the heavy makeup of black eyes and shave the head in the Mochanian style.
