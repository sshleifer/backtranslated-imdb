So when I was little I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. We'd watch it all the time. when our friends arrived, we would have pajama nights and watch the magic toys of the mountain and rock candy grandpa. I'm 21 and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently got together and watched, we met all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. A friend actually bought this movie and magic toys from Grandpa to his 2 year old daughter because she wants to spend our love of this movie. This is really a movie that you can let your children watch and feel safe, without violence, without bad language, just great songs and important lessons.
