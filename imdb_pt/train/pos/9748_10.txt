I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 and in classic rock (I still am) ... <br /> <br /> I've never liked opera before because I hate soprano voices but it changed all that. He was adorable in the movie and had an incredible voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died tonight at the home of pancreatic cancer, he will be missing, and he definitely left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, watch it and enjoy it. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and take a look before I run out.
