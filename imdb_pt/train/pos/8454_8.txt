The second alternate tale of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is another different view of the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found, but the Gundam Wing is really different from its counterparts. The largest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In fact, the series did not really become a show about the war until episode 7, but in fact the real conflict, the Eve Wars, does not happen until the later episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest plus of this series are the characters. All the main characters are developed over the 49 episodes and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they put. Another great advantage is the fantastic character and the mecha design of the series. The designs put some of their other Gundam counterparts in shame. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is the amount of UC fans who claim to have come out of the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the most apparent clone of the Gundam Seed UC is out of my league. It is true that there are many moments raised, but they are told in new ways and there are different differences as well. <br /> <br /> Take for example the usual comparison between Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more the pariah of the Alliance and also of the OZ, whereas the Red Comet was the brilliant symbol of Zeon. Another great difference is the fact that Zechs loses a lot of soldiers under his command, hence the other nickname he gave in the first episodes: "Killer of his own men." Char does not receive this label. <br /> <br /> The problems in this series are not the mumbo jumbo philosophy, but two problems. The first is the reused animation of the Gundams' attacks. Of course it's fun to see attack tanks of heavy weapons, MS, and airplanes for the first time. But in its fourth reuse, scenes like this are already aging. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series should happen for a whole year. If you really think about all the events that come up in the series, a lot happens in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily ignore this by ignoring the first few lines of the introduction from time to time. As it ranks, this is probably the best of the Gundam tales of the Alternative Universe and a great introduction to the world of Gundam. After all, this was the first Gundam anime to be aired on American television.
