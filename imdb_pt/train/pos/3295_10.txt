A film of beauty so difficult to describe. Maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogues, or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch that movie again and again. I've never seen another Indian film come close to it, and few from any country rival its perfection.
