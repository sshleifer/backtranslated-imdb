Actually I really liked this movie. Not because of his plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it because it is one of the worst movies ever created. It's so bad, so bad, it gets terribly funny. Some jokes are really cool, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the screenwriter. "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
