I saw this movie for the first time three years ago, and it was introduced by then-Disney boss Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, he returned to the TV, and this time I recorded. Since then I must have attended at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring movie that feels good and is intelligently written and imagined by everyone involved. It resists all the sentimental tricks of the book, as well as all other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It's exciting to see a movie where kids are not jerks and have a lot of behavioral problems. and athletes are not portrayed as testosterone muscleheads. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood went to another extreme to what they call "brave realism," making films where everyone curses, and has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream, and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. The people in Big Lake TX seem so nice that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to overdo sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as always, never disappoints. I've watched it since the late 70's, and it's so underrated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has excellent performances from ALL concerned, and compliments to writers. <br /> <br /> A gem in the movie is nearing the end when Jim is practicing on the bench before the big game, and his wife calls out of the stands. He runs and reaches his family. The look on the faces of the other three jugs sitting on the bench in the shed is invaluable. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change of pace, then choose this movie.
