I entered this movie without knowing anything about it and I ended up enjoying it very much. There was a lack of authenticity and credibility - some of the things the characters said and did were completely bizarre, and much of the script seemed to have been improvised (maybe this is typical of Woody Allen?). It was not even in the jokes of the movie itself, but in the whole movie itself. The performance reminded me of Seinfeld's performance, where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes - they are sentimental, but if you do not take the movie too seriously, you can really enjoy the mood of the actors, not the characters. If you are looking for a random movie, and you like Woody Allen, I definitely recommend it!
