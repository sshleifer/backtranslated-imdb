I always knew Anne DeSalvo was a great actress, now I know she's a great writer / director too. I've been a fan since the first time I saw her in "Perfect," "My Favorite Year," "DC Cab," and "Stardust Memories." <br /> <br /> It's so rare to see Lee Grant these days. in anything. She has been missing from the screen for too long. It's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a comedy. This is his best work since "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an American American family, you'll love this movie. I was not expecting much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have the chance, watch.
