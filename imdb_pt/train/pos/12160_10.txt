A very underrated black comedy, the best of a series of great guignol films to accompany "Baby Jane". Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young doomed murderers (a sign of 'compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for teenage candidates, a lot of hilariously untalented kids frequented by lousy theater moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more of a Marion Davies', she tells Winters) leads the boys on their show and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a delightfully funny tango and, above all, gives an excellent performance, unlike anything she has done before. The atmosphere is a good blend of comic and mysterious. It looks wonderful with great detail from the period (30's). Lots of gorgeous thefts in Hollywood and the terrifying tot movie. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama trainer: 'Hamilton Starr', he snores, 'two r', but prophetic, however '. See and love.
