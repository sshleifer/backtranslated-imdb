the film is much more sophisticated and intelligent is the exploitation of sexual tension than American attempts like 9 and a half weeks ... the court scene itself ... with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine begs for his orgasm. It's incredible ... I have not seen this movie in 20 years ... but it has made indelible images in my mind ... it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the motor of all activity, and in Bottom is the anguish that lives in all of us .... the plot is European, and it snakes a little, but so does life ... especially when you're 17 and have a constant hard time ...
