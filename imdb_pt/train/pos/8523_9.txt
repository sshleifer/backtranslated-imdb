I had been a fan of the book since third grade, so of course I watched the movie, read the sequence and watched the television show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only real problem with that is that he did not follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I hung up. But this comes from a girl who owns a first addition to the book. But after a while I decided to try again and ignored the book (kind of what you have to do with the Harry Potter movies). I found the series wonderful! It was clean and something everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy to keep everyone going. It is truly enjoyable! Clean and wonderful!
