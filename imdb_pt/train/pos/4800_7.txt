I joined The Straight Story expecting a sad / happy drama with legal direction and some good acting. These I have. What I did not expect was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Give Lynch a simple story about a 300-mile journey on a lawn mower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you did not notice, watch again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin encounters, the ground he is going through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of arguments he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the latter is out of a graveyard). The last road he drives is particularly haunted in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness increase. The ultimate mechanical failure can be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of its motor related to an afterlife in which it reaches the desired meeting. <br /> <br /> I just hope some of the people who have scored it as a satiated and slow melodrama take time to watch with more holistic attention.
