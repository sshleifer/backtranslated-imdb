me and my sister used to rent it every time we got movies and our parents would be so mad about it (but they leave us anyway) and I love it ... I can not find someone who lives near me who knows the that I'm talking about ... I'm happy to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find this on DVD somewhere !! I would love to watch it now, bc I loved it as much as a child ... and I'm 15 now !!! I remember a lot about it ... it's where I got the bunny fufu and all my friends know the song, but not the movie !! I think the little girl came sliding the slide into her little thing in the playground
