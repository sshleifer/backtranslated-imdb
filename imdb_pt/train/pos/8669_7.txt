If, unlike some of the commentators here, you are not organizing a class war and do not mind seeing the lives of other people who are successful, outgoing, bohemian and not being very English at a party. types of problems as a result, this is not a bad movie, closer to the Euro cinema than an imitation of the usual American crap ... I believe that minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than do bad movies, I advocate this, the film is not worse as a result, and puts the spotlight on the cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie - think that's her name, as the drunken sarcastic is perfect) an exception is David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious things! It's lightweight, and we're not going for this kind of anatomy relationship crap in this country, but if you have no real friends to go to a party than you could do worse than sit and watch it.
