I started watching the show from season one, and at first I was pretty skeptical about it. The original movie was kind of childish, and I was just looking for some science fiction show while waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I loved the characters - the not-so-stupid as you think - he is Jack O'Neill, the not only smart Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, women and children preferred, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but most of the times they are not about technology or space - it is helping your friend, even risking your life for him. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". Fighting to the end when all hope is lost. About free will, and all the good qualities that make a human being - Human. <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking a record, going into Season 10, and still doing good.
