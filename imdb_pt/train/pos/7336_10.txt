This is another fantasy favorite of Ralph Bakshi; after watching on YouTube that's it. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric search for sword and witchcraft between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Ice Kingdom and his mother, Queen Juliana, aims to conquer the known world. When his glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) promises to avenge his people and kill the Lord of Ice. Meanwhile, the subhuman subordinates of Nekron and Juliana capture the sensual daughter of King Jarol, Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape and ends up meeting Larn, who promises to accompany her back to Firekeep; if the subhumans do not find them first. This movie did very few box office (as did most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but it has become a cult classic, in part because of the quality of the film. art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also, I heard the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who had made Conan comics, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; although he admitted that he had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his works of art for statues, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company, as well as paintings. And like the Bakshi movies, The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this movie than the first. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I think it's one of the best animated films. fantasy films already made, and an incredible collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of fantasy, sexual innuendos and exciting adventures.
