The Impossible Planet and Satan's Well together form the two best episodes of Doctor Who's 'new' second season. Having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of Quatermass and Pit (1967) into a scenario of outer space, with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the Beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional. ties between Rose and the Doctor, while also highlighting Rose's growing self-confidence, establishing her as a non-equal-yet-but-getting-partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is the sleek script by Matt Jones, which lessens the occasional excessive reliance on one-liners for the Doctor, and the performances of the entire cast, most notably the excellent Shaun Parkes as Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
