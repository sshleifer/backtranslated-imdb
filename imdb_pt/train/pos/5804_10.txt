Michael Jackson is not very popular in the US, but in Europe (especially in Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it has no plot, it is full of clichés, Michael praises constantly. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can not expect a plot or non-clichés. in this kind of movie! It has fun visual effects and the music is perfect. The Smooth Criminal fragment - the best music of all time, full of moonwalks, dance groups and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces with a Michael (even white ) Jackson! <br /> <br /> A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance fans. <br /> <br /> However, since I'm a MJ fan, I have to tell you everything Michael Jackson hates: DO NOT watch this movie, you'd only increase your hatred ...
