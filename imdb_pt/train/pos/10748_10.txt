I have to say that the events of September 11th did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to deal with the devastation. I was the only one who was changing the station on the radio and TV channel if there was any talk about the towers. I was tired of hearing about it. When it aired on TV a year and a day later, I was crying. It was the first time I've cried since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I see it now on TV five years later, and I'm still crying over the tragedies. The fact that it contains one of the only video shots of the first plane crashing into the tower is incredible. It was an accident, and look where they came. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
