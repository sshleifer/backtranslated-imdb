What begins as generational conflict in this film ends in understanding, solemnity, and grace. The film snakes through Europe with his father and son crammed into a car of over 3000 miles. Cramps force lifestyles, beliefs, and life skills to collide. There really is no clear winner. Everything adds up in the end as experience, multi-layered experience of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle view without being aggressive on the agenda. It is a maturing story for the young son, his scornful and rebellious nature becoming the opening to receive more ways of life.
