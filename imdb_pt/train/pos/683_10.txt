I like ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps at night, voices that can not be explained. Now I see many of them. As special effects have increasing control over today's movies, sometimes to find a real jewel, you need to go back in time when writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this very rare pilot episode for the Ghost Story TV series called "The New House" was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but nothing since then, compared to that. With all the remake going on in Hollywood, someone should do it "as is" with no more special effects than the original. This episode was pretty scary as hell. I'm lucky to finally find it on DVD today and it's very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 ghost stories that came close were the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling." I wish someone would make more ghost stories like these.
