He is a mad scientist who creates a half-man half-man shark on an unknown island, then summons all his former business friends and academics to come and see his creation (evil laughs), but in fact he wants his sharkman kill them! Many bad GCIs, goofy plot elements and babes sweating on tight T-shirts follow. <br /> <br /> All these monster movies follow a similar formula, but this one tempers things with a little humor (I guarantee people who did that had languages ​​firmly planted on the cheek), not to mention the girls sexy But let's mention those sexy girls - various hotties, tight T-shirts, sweating profusely. One is in his underwear in the beginning, another in the end. Thank you, thank you, bad movie makers! The plot is full of silly things, a guy drives in a jeep, crashes into a tree, then offers to fly everyone on the island in a helicopter. Yeah, well, how about thinking about it for a while; I'll come back to you. The sharkman is hilarious - be it a horrible CGI or an equally comical face with a rubber costume. The mad scientist gives a good performance; he is evil, that is his motivation, he does not apologize. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a B-movie, FUN and stupid, this should do the job.
