An excellent film about two policemen loving the same woman. One of the policemen (Périer) killed her, but all evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unfortunate Montand does not know who the other mistress might have killed her, and Périer does not know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer ... and what a great end! Highly recommended.
