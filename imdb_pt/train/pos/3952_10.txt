I feel like I have some rare disease that no one heard of and finally found a support group on the net! I finally found this title by asking for an answer on a website of "experts" on the web. I also saw this movie in my youth and was impressed with the atmosphere and especially with the ending. I've never forgotten that and have never seen it since. No one I know saw the movie and I almost gave up on finding the title. Unfortunately, even knowing the name, I'll probably never see the movie again, because it's impossible to find it commercially. Small steps ... <br /> <br />
