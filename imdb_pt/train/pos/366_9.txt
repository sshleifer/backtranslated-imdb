This movie is so wonderful that it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not decide which was better, the book or the movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is amazing, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, she can be funny, happy and unhappy. All at once. All together the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg, and should not be ignored. 9/10
