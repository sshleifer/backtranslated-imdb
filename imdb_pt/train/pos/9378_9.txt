Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' American friend. Nick Cage is innocently recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a true Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero becomes more entangled the more he tries to break free. And the small town of the United States does not seem so safer than the Great City. Like the predecessor mentioned above, this movie has many twists that seem improbable, but all lead to cathartic self-discovery.
