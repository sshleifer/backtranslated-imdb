Although critically defamed, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is a film that must be watched closely; some of the funny parts are made in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them. For example, keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of the pet shop pricing tool ... and also the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare movies where humor unexpectedly surprises you, even though it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp here - If you liked her best known movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should take a look at this. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely sympathetic in the title role and the support cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo and Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
