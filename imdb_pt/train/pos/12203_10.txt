"The Lady From Shanghai" by Orson Welles, does not have the brilliant screenplay of "Citizen Kane", for example, but the cinematography of Charles Lawton, Jr., the unforgettable scenarios (such as the scene in the aquarium, the sea scene featuring a dazzling blond crack singing "Please Do not Love Me" and the amazing climax of Hall of Mirrors, and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in her best performance, Welles in a beautifully under-played role, the aforementioned Miss Hayworth - the wife of Welles at the time - in its most beautiful form) makes a very memorable movie experience.The mystery plot of bizarre murder is fun and attractive, not inscrutable at all.The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns, and the closing line of Welles is an unannounced classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" receives four stars from this impartial referee.
