This was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought that each episode had one more advantage to this and the villains had a lot of creative thinking put into them (and even very scary and believable as well). Some of the best episodes were "I Left My Neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Shouts Under the Sea", "The Ghoul, the Bat and the Ugly" and "When You Want About a Star Creature". If you've never seen these episodes, please do so. This series was kind of messy, since there were other episodes that did not seem to have the same kind of edge to them, like "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Rescue of Scooby Chief." Like the previous series, it was very well crafted, an interesting and brilliantly drawn plot. As everyone says, though, it would have been much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and disturbing for the story being told.
