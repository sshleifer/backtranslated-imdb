I think this movie is well done and realistic. I'm used to watching Hollywood action movies, and using this as a standard to evaluate this movie, you're bound to be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what elevates it above the ordinary action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish military and therefore can not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as I've seen the extra "making of" I am convinced that there has been a lot to avoid mistakes. This is a movie I will recommend to others to watch. Realistic story of high quality and film.
