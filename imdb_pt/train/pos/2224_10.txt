A hangman (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) is pleased to fulfill all the fantasies of all men on the death row before meeting their creator. And which way to go. Lucky this movie is not real, or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row. <br /> <br /> It starts slowly. Low brightness and poor acting, like most films (B). It gets better as you go. And ends with a bang. <br /> <br /> I would rate this very high in the low-cost and very sexy movies of the 90's. It is a must see since the kids are away or in bed.
