THE JIST: Look at something else. <br /> <br /> This film was very well rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it I can not understand why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has an interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments and a scary feeling of "noir". But this is not fun. It also does not make much sense, in the plot, but especially in the character's motivations. I do not know anyone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie to face - I suggest you do not take up the challenge.
