Snobs and pseudo-experts consider it "far from the best of De Sica." Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem in connection with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very directly. His Italianity does not have the self-examination of the modern Italian filmmakers, or the bitter parody of Pietro Germi, the poignant bitterness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us stories like a father sitting on the edge of his children's bed before going to bed. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo Milano and, to a lesser extent, Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what we now call magical realism. The movie is a gem from start to finish and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but that naturally requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Magnificent.
