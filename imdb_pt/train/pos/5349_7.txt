The Running Man is one of those movies that if overwatched, would become boring and even depressing. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch maybe once or twice a year with a couple of friends and some drinks. In the current climate of TV domination and capitalist mode in society, it actually functions as a revisionist social commentary after the boom of the 80s. Forget it! There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this movie. Schwarzenegger is in his best shape as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of a liner was completely inspired - truly leg-end-dary (with his speech to Killian about a camera the main highlight). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is authentically American, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the PC TV program 'Gladiators'. and WWE as well. The sinister ending of Buzz-Saw will cool any viewer to the core (as a footnote, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an optimistic actioner with a bitter sense of humor?) /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as supporting muscles (and are the buttons of Arnies in real life), and even have Mick Fleetwood in it too! What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> I recommend Running Man if you're looking for a great piece of entertainment action with a glossty finish and some great characters. Just do not expect an education from her (at least surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really love it. You will too, unless it is a thesp. 7/10
