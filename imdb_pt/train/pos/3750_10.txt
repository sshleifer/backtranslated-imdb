This is a great short. I think every voice is made by Jason Steele. (you can just tell only if you've heard his normal voice so do not worry about them sounding the same, they do not.) they are about 15 minutes long. <br /> <br /> edward the spatula is fighting the war against spoons and he knows some strange people. in fact, everyone he knows sounds pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "General Peterson, we have to get him to a medical unit!" "No, I will not do this edward." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm Edward Edward, and you know it." "Before I go." "Yes?" "Can I just have ... a kiss?" "Umm not." "Come on, just one, little, spout in the mouth?" "I'm leaving now, sir." <br /> <br /> There will be film soon. the date for this is in September, but will probably be postponed.
