I thought it was a really good movie and should have been released in theaters first. It would not have been a great blockbuster, but it would have made good money. The movie has suspense and makes you wonder how much this is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do a good job. Considering it's his first movie, he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just do not know what you want to rent that night. It should go very well. The cast was great. So I recommend that everyone check out this movie!
