I am a writer who works from home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime companion - good, clean fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of Dick van Dyke's show. As we all were innocent (and how innocent is the Murder Diagnosis). I particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgic figures like Joe Mannix. The bad guys are always caught, the good guys go on. The stars clearly have fun and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> A steak: why were so many villains female or at least bitches? Amanda was very dizzy. It's hard to imagine her actually doing something as horrible as an autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we have not seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, esp. at lunch !!
