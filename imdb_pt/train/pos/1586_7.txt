Rosenstrasse is more of an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept many moviegoers looking for a storyline similar to that of a Pianist. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist sneak peek into a brightly colored epoch, but very little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the standpoint of ordinary Arian German, and not from the Jewish point of view. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unrealized burdens of people trapped in historical circumstances from which they emerge as victims. The rhythm of the film is introspective, painfully slow, meditative. In addition, the characters are so vivid, while transitions between generations and the passage of time have been cleverly created. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative failures are well discerned. Another flaw lies in a trivial cinematography incapable of capturing the intensity of the inner drama experienced by the characters. However, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmare past, a trend that includes such excellent films as Nowhere in Africa and recently the controversial Downfall. I would recommend this movie to those who know how to read beyond the pictures.
