A best-selling book on honor crimes in Jordan is taken down by its editors after allegations that the story was invented; associated with other claims of its author's past as an adult woman. A few years later, she reappears, admitting that she has taken a certain amount of dramatic leave but is willing to cooperate with a filmmaker to prove the substance of her claims. What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, someone who behaves in a makes no sense unless what she is saying is true, but who is seemingly unable to say anything that is not astonishingly dramatic but in the best false assumption. It is almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film: vindication? celebrity? All she can do is project a certain image of herself as a deeply injured individual, and even that can not be taken at face value. Director Anna Broinowski appears more and more in front of the cameras as the film advances, and more and more exasperated; but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable, albeit scary and disturbing tale to tell - and one of those movies that reminds us of the utterly strange world in which we live.
