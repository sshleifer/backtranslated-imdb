... this is a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. Good story, funny situations from rich to rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad lead, maybe not perfect, but he's funny; D Do not pay attention to the classification, it is BS. Watch, then watch something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I do not think we can be friends XD At this point, I recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to all Brooks fans;) Vote 10 against the ignorant reviews of earthworms! Do I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
