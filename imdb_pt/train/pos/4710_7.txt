As far as parody films are concerned, there are few that are worth the time and energy. but with a recent resurgence of horrible parodies like Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end of medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mob. What follows is a series of jokes, most of which work, there are, however, occasional failures. But a foreign gangster who does not know how to master the American language (at least it's a dirty word), a rival gangster with a crush for throwing his mouth out (... once!), A younger brother with the DA out there to get Johhny Dangerously, and a young hot and hot star by his affections has Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, as every gangster movie clich√© is stuck by a talented and decent writing cast. <br /> <br /> Not perfect, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
