Myself and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can not get enough of this amazing Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried renting this on DVD, but I can not seem to find it - too bad, as I'm sure the features would be "extra special" !! :) We all strongly recommend this super cool comedy for a date, or even just a cozy night at home! This would also be the kind of purr√°fico movie to watch with your cat, or even make a party based on, as a "Party Girl" party, as well as the movie that the adorable, huggable, squeezable Parker Posey will. to the end. Oh, and stay tuned to a surprise and Hilarious final surprise ... depart, The Sixth Sense, you have just been overtaken by a much more radiant film! Sorry, no offense, just calling as is! Take it from a former movie lover, the comedy simply does not get any better than Party Girl with Parker P! Feel! Yours, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
