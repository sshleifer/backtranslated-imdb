Roseanne's last season was a crazy roller coaster. This final episode does exactly what an earlier review says, telling us as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we do not know. Roseanne goes back to the first season and tells us that this show was her interpretation of her life. She says in this final episode that she has changed events and people as they please. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David were married to opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she made him live. As the events happened in her life, she changed them in her writing. Not all of us wish we could do that. We all do not have a moment in time when we want to be able to use only a rubber and change for our taste. This is what she did with the whole episode. And for another comment, I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, it just changed the way the events happened in their lives. An A + ending in an A + show !!!!
