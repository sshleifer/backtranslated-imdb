This incredible Oscar winner (4 in total) and the first Oscar-winning Oscar, is simply fascinating, with a score of Max Steiner. Called an art film because Ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution, and greed and stupidity. But what makes this film a classic is the stunning direction and photography and the use of fog and lighting, which was so different from the American movie ever, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And the Oscar-winning performance of Victor McLaglen as the drunken Gypo is simply unbelievable. Basically the film takes place in Ireland, and Gypo turns into a friend in the rebel movement for the British to collect 20 pounds to give his girlfriend. But having all that money, he begins to blow it all night and give it away while the movement's leaders are trying to locate the informant. The whole movie is a dark and hazy night in Ireland, and a cast of characters that are memorable, but all the time, the whole world of Gypo is approaching him, both psychologically. If I had to choose maybe three directors to have ALL their movies on a desert island forever, and no one else, John Ford would surely be one of them. What a truly remarkable film ...
