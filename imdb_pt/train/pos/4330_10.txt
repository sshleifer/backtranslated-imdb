<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is undoubtedly the best adaptation of a novel by Charles Dickens ever seen on screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this Mini Series television. The late, great Denholm Elliot was perfectly scaled up like the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was pure perfection like the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, making small plot cuts that do not affect the story. in all, a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
