This is the magnum opus of the Swedish king of crap, Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely has a film of this magnitude been made in Sweden and really stands out as one of the most amazing achievements of Swedish cinema to this day. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to defect to Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian military who kidnap him and say he arrived in Sweden. This trick is his way of seeing that Markov continues his work on nuclear physics that will revolutionize the supply of energy to the entire planet. The CIA, however, is committed to taking Markov to the west and sending his ninjas to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice of having Swedish actors speaking English is something Mats-Helge perfected in his later works. The cheap movie b sensation that this creates is probably unparalleled for performance. But beyond that? Well, the action is the standard straightforward style for video. Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians dying. People running in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What really catches the eye is the insane way the fight scenes are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title, I hope the martial arts, I hope the next fight. But there are maybe two or three actual martial arts scenes in this movie. And they are hilarious. It's so bad I do not have the words to describe it. If the ninjas moved more slowly, their hearts would stop. And of course, the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a McDonald's voucher. <br /> <br /> So, what's the verdict? Instant classic, of course. Never before was a film so obviously intended to be consumed along with large amounts of alcohol. It's the final movie of the party. Insert the video and laugh. You have to realize that movies like these are no longer made. This is the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> So the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
