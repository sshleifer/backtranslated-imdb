I read a lot of comments about this movie and I have to say "What's wrong with you?!?!" This was a great movie! I thought this movie was great from start to finish and the story was very well told. I'm convinced that people who did not like this movie were not paying much attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes that, if you are not paying attention, will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I ask everyone who did not like this movie to watch it again and watch it on their own so you can really pay attention. The story made perfect sense to me and, as I said, was very well told. Each scene in the movie has a point and everything fits at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I really did not expect anything good for him, but he did a great performance. Ed Harris was the real gem of the movie. He plays a truly sick guy and really makes you see how upset your character is. Watch your eyes on your scenes, just superb !!! Also, there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) in one of her early roles ... not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers. This is a great movie and must be seen. Do not listen to all the opinions of these people, go see the film and draw your own conclusions. I hope you see the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br/> <br/> -Chris
