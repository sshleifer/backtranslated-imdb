Not at all my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the film almost totally delicious. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays "Miss Bates" are absolutely wonderful. The detail of the period is not alienating; the feel of the film is correct, in fact. But the real 'find' is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There could be no more perfect cast, IMO. I hated Mr. K in the novel, but I found him wonderfully human and human in the movie. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to pleasure! Highly recommended. AnaR
