Hidden Frontiers - it's more than fanfiction - it's a well thought out and organized series that keeps the Star Trek worlds alive and growing. From a fun little fan project to now a well-known net series; Hidden Frontiers has something for all star trek fans. Defined in the Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager timeline, Hidden Frontier addresses topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series with defined stories using well-developed characters, plot and story arcs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier took on social context stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and showed the development of characters in long-term space missions - the real things that happen closely, as well as the exciting wars and space conflicts. Wi addicts know and love. Made in studio "Green Screen"; Hidden Frontiers brings a cheerful cast of regulars to the screen and to their hearts. The great cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. The inventive use of green screen technology, props, makeup and costumes all work to make the worlds of the Star Trek Hidden Frontier fun and believable. Hidden Frontier was where few steps to go in the world of science fiction, and thrived when they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature from a well-thought-out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. I recommend taking the time to download and watch.
