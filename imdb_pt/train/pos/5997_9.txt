Let me start by saying that I've never reviewed a movie on IMDb before; however, I'm in the video biz myself. And coming from that perceptive; I can say, without a doubt, that this film is what should be short. It has a very good story and another thing that I love (an even better twist end). The opening was very well done, I loved the video chosen for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a B & W fan, but the way this movie uses the effect it works on. And with any movie that's all that matters. The film flow works perfectly and the editing has been done very well. From a technical side of things (which is the side I usually work on) everything is also very well done. There are no great technologies. things to point to. Only a minor one that I have is that the final credits are a bit bouncy. This is probably due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I would prefer to see more of the love scene, but I am expensive (so you can attribute this to a face factor). <br /> <br /> So, overall, I consider it a 9/10. It is worth watching if you are a fan of Indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. Sorry for the bad grammar or spelling.
