I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series yet, I mean POTENTIAL .. we all know there's a chance they'll leave the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT I DO NOT HOPE! For those who have not seen it ... Without that annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" floating over their heads every time they find races, it might be cool ... and Scott Bakula was undoubtedly a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and Vulcan Babe too it's hot, (check out the decontamination scene) I gave it a FULL 10 ... scare off ALL the other openers in the series ... I hope this goes over 7 years ...
