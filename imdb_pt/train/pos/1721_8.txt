If this movie had been made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. However, for 1909, this was a small dandy movie and still holds up very well today. Just do not try to compare this silent movie to later silences - the industry has changed so radically that the short of the first decade of the 20th century does not look anything like movies made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> This film is 11 minutes long and is a variation on the story of Edgar Allen Poe, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I will not elaborate anymore as I do not want to ruin the film. Suffice it to say that it is very scary !!
