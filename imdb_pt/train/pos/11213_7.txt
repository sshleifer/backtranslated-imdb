This second film is as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. We know what he's going to do and what's going to happen before it's even suggested on the screen. Then pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks take place and their succession. We know that there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose a wheel, that the car will have an accident, just to talk about the car. And this is what happens. Now the details and details are for you to discover them in the movie. That he may be attracted to some stupid woman is obvious and has to come, but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows that he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how does he get out of it? This is what you should discover for yourself. And do not worry, he'll have the main dealer, but as is another story. A speedboat is no match for our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he will be injured. They did not know what bulletproof vests were in those days. It is true that recently it was discovered that some soldiers did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on hounding the traffickers and this blindness does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that can disrupt this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these assets so that they can be duly observed and watched? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, it is much less fun to use them, do them. It is the forbidden or restricted that is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
