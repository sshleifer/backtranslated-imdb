Taking advantage of the "demon-clergy-clergy" trend of the late 1960s and early 1970s that most prominently included the triptych of "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Prophesy," "The Watchtower" is a Also, it is as good (though the most overlooked of the lot). In a way, it combines the best elements of these films and releases in a dash of "The Tenant" by Polanski (which came out the same year) to a good extent. A New York model unable to commit to her lawyer's boyfriend happens to reside in a moss-covered house that initially appears to be the perfect spot; she meets an astute old gallant of a neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), as well as the other off-center tenants. Kept awake by loud noises above her apartment, she soon learns that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise abandoned building. From there, director Michael Winner ("Death Wish") prepares this supernatural suspense, and there is a diabolical joy in the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine. Helped by a brilliant cast, a subtle plot and excellent Dick Smith FX makeup ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a genuinely scary horror film.
