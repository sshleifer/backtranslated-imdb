One of the best drama films I've ever seen. We act a lot in the church and this is something that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that the actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting, as a "must see". There are several note scenes. On the one hand, the cemetery scene when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about that scene just going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was tremendous - I suppose a testimony of Shakespeare more than anything else. For a second, I really enjoyed the scene in which Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the next duel.
