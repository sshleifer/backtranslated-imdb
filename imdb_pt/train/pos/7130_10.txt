Well, when before seeing this movie I really was not sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought this was one of the best movies I've watched for a long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new "adoptive" father, this movie meets all requirements. I did not read the book (maybe that's a good thing & meant I liked the movie better), but as far as the story goes, I really can not think of any bad points, therefore scoring 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think that something deserves the best marks!). At the moment William proclaimed 'I CAN PASS MY BICYCLE, FATHER!' I was sobbing my heart (anyone who has seen will understand, I'm sure). Really comforting and definitely recommended.
