The title caught my eye and then I wondered what would come out in the plot, since we saw so many "super people" movies these years ... and, in fact, I really enjoyed it, since there were an unusual number of movies. Funny scenes I did not expect. Uma Thurman performed as an average in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was again able to see the toes in wide screen (as in the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played very well the stupid guy who knows the big woman, I could really get into your situation. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and Matt, especially to cheer on your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
