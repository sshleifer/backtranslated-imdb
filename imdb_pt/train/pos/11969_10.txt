I loved this show growing and I still watch the DVD of the first season at age 19 today. What can I say? I grew up in a house very much like Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference is that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. Besides, I grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what I would have done without Full House on television. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them because I'm the middle son of my family like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle, and I'm a big sister as a DJ. I really like how the show always has moral values. because I really do not like any of the OC type shows today. I also like the comedy from Full House. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the girls' uncle, father's father and father, respectively. The story goes that after the girls' mother dies, Danny's best friend, Joey and his brother-in-law, Jesse moves in to help raise the kids. Three men trying to raise three girls = hilarious. Each character in Full House is full of heart, funny and genuinely believable. Joey is an aspiring comedian with a child's heart and soul. Jesse is the legal uncle, motorcycle rider, tough guy who is softened by his three nieces and later his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, of Summerville). Kids and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
