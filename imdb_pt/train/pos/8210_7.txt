Clint Eastwood reprises her role as Dirty Harry, which this time is about the case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) who is killing the people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood plays his part and the film is mostly more action than talking, not that I'm complaining. Sudden impact is actually enjoyable entertainment.
