The first movie had little ambition, so nothing gets stuck on the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero charm. Once he accepts that Bill & Ted is an idiot, the joke can only be hammered into the audience for so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards, this is more fun. This was avoided after the release, sad considering that more talents are involved than the first time. We have the 'Face / Off' photographer, the 'Fugitive' editor, a production designer of Burton's early works, and the 'Matrix' sound designer. <br /> <br /> The writers made up for the first shallow walk with something deep. As this was avoided by the fans and audience, the director probably decided that the style was very radical. It is not, it fits the material. Like "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22," this dares to be clever, but we like our "simple" movies not to buy it. Probably, since that dared to be different that is why it took 12 producers to withdraw it. What is so good? <br /> <br /> - A good self-reference for Keanu; from the head of the air to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - He hates his creations as much as he hates his colleagues, he makes his own hate. The Evil B & T and the "good uses of the robot" have the same vocabulary as the originals: smaller copies and depreciation of the language. <br /> <br /> - The motive of "duality." Nowhere is this more evident than in photography styles, many high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith's 'Total Recall' to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The reason for the "choices". I do not know where this started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's very well used here. It even comes down to the 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Self-referral thread, even present in the game against Death (Clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Watch the cover of Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie". Ironic also as Death and Nomolos were villains in the sequels of 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon'. <br /> <br /> I still have some smaller nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different media, so it does not make sense because many scripts revolve around the first one - particularly in the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these movies he is wasted. Besides, despite all the boldness this effort demonstrates, even making gay jokes, they can not kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, even though it sounds like a Nickelodeon production, that's incredibly interesting. From this movie we have Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in heaven and we have just assaulted three people." Final Analysis = Midrange Material
