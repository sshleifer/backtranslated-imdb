Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movie. It was decent and fun, though it was still very funny. There were a few clich√©s, but I found most of the new things. At first I did not think it would be good at all. When you can get past the first 20 minutes, the movie starts to get more interesting. This movie was not bursting with hilarious laughter, and it was not OH MY GOSH wonderful. It was just a movie that you can sit back and enjoy how nice it was. I do not see how bad this movie was. It's just a bit low. I could have dealt with a 5.5 but a 4.8? Also, giving this movie a 1 is shameful. It was very nice, and there was nothing awful enough to give a 1, which is what most people gave.
