Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean .... it's funny. Its violent. It is very nice. Most people say it's B, but that could not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good acting. The Only Weird thing is, of course, the killer snowman. I think this movie was really one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most movies these days do not have the criteria of a Clive Barker masterpiece. That is, be original and give the viewer what they do not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Note: A +. Ed also recommends the movie Uncle Sam to fans of Jack Frost.
