Brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in recreating the affectionate portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - intended double meaning! Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel The Tin Drum, filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another cinematic adaptation of the interior monologue that I favorably compares to Strick's film. <br /> <br /> Although there are Dublin landmarks clearly recognized in the original novel and in the film, there are also recognizable characters, albeit with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, is a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film, for all its excellence, becomes even richer with additional visions. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
