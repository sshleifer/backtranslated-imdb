Like the one-line summary says, two movies left that remark on me when I left the theater. The first was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky." <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where you sit on the theater bench and stop thinking about someone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie fast where you want it. .. Getting out of the theater was a little strange, like that feeling you feel when you are sick and can not think of anything. One of those movies you become one with the guy, and feel that nothing else moves around you than things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure. The actors are awesome, the soundtrack is great, and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Surely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the movie that made the best and most shocking of waking up my life and my purpose in this world.
