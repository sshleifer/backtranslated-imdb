Let me first say that this show was first rate when John Ritter was there. After his death, the show fell somewhat, but the producers did not give up the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. The show centers around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, which he his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), his daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and his son Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would burst out laughing (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'm just going to laugh a little with an occasional warm laugh. I'm so glad I fell in the trance of this show after Ritter's untimely death, because that made eps with Ritter so much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is so well played and well rounded that you may not help him, but love him. He's always telling girls about dating, but he really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate dad who hates the boyfriend's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is great too, and she is also a nice character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength to her children, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter were friends long ago. <br /> <br /> The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She's the ultimate blonde: beautiful, slow, idiot, but she's a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' mood and how presumptuous she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can get a little annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only flaw in the show is that the show never gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She is always behind Bridget, and her character feels like it is played there. Martin Spanjers as the lonely son of Hennessy is hysterical, and when Ritter is in the show, he is mostly comedic material. After Ritter's death, the program provides some stories for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are nothing more than laughter, with the occasional story of C.J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father as a bit of background information. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I give this program a great review, because it's a great show that had a tragic event that crippled it. You'll have fun. <br /> <br /> 9/10 --spy
