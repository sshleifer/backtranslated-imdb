The Korean War was nicknamed the Forgotten War of the Americas. So many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50,000 men who died there. Occasionally, we are presented with a piece or movie that deals with that distant and ghostly frozen cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker." The story is of an American soldier called a sergeant. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) who is selected for a secret mission by his commander. Its task is to defect to the North Koreans and offer their services against the United Nations forces. So successful is his disguise, he proves inestimable to the enemy and received the rank of Major. However, he is later captured by the Americans, brought to trial as a traitor and a spy. Claiming that he was ordered to defect, he unfortunately discovers that his commander has been killed and has no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He is condemned and sentenced to hang. However, his conviction is called into question by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his promoter. Convincing Commander Gen. Amos Baily, (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed. The court drama is top notch as is the cast, which includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as sergeant. Max Winkler. Korea was far away but the possibility of condemning a communist and hanging him came very close to home in the 1950s. Because of his superior script and powerful message, this drama became a court classic. Excellent viewing and recommended for all. ****
