I never watched the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until I read the other reviews here, I did not know that this movie was the 'award' of that competition. I was just launching channels and I came across this, and found myself watching, eagerly daring, all the way to the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was made (The Most Dangerous Game, etc.), but I was expecting, and almost getting, the 'catchy' - as the protagonist would defeat the hunter in the end. I think the high tech was exaggerated (GPS) and gave me flashbacks from the Night Rider, but it was not much of an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that was required of the viewer. Did we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could throw lots of incendiary grenades at a public bridge and NO COPS appear to investigate? Could a limousine make countless donuts at a Las Vegas intersection and no COPS appear? Pleeease. A lot of that sort of thing - fun to watch, but at least plausibly, thank you. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the end was disappointing, with the after taste. a bad episode of Star Trek. At least now I understand why the acting was so extravagant - with the exception of Zane, who does not even come close to working as he deserves IMHO - they were the winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Expel me.
