What seemed at first just another introvert French film offering nothing more than a perverse feeling became for me, in the second exhibition, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfactory presentation. <br /> <br /> Spoiler of type follows. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; he apparently did not know what hit him. Poor public; Initially, we were stuck in what seemed to be a really beautiful and romantic story, to be whisked back and forth to the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just were not part of the first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional bond made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to be content to share life with someone whose sensitivity was more in tune with the carnival festivities. Beach. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the action of the camera in this movie. Captions were totally unnecessary, even if my French was "presque rien". I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished and very professional film. Although many scenes seem superfluous, I rate it nine out of ten.
