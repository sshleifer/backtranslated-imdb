This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of his films and actually had a following storyline. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is such a fantastic and underrated actress. There were a few moments that could have been developed a bit more, and some scenes that probably could have been cut to make the room to do so, but after all, this is worth the price to rent and see. The performance was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his feature talking directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played their part well.
