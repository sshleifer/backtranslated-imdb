My favorite movie of all time. Oscar caliber work by all involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The script is perfect, and works the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other characters were attracted is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won an Oscar for director Mike Newell and director of photography Rex Maidment. It's the best work of Josie Lawrence, by far, and turned my opinion on Joan Plowright. Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I do not see any glitches in it. The song, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet, is a marvel.
