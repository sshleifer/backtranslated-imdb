Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides that he will leave his small life in Texas and succeed in the Big City. Women are there to ask and men are mainly "tutti-fruttis". With wide eyes, he comes to New York, unprepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the midst of this chaos, he meets and befriends Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless-looking man who lives in a seemingly doomed building. <br /> <br /> There is not much history as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes designed to bring to light not only Joe Buck's difficulties in the City but also interspersed with his past and show us in impact cuts and sequences of semi-psychedelic dreams from his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt), who was raped in a group, his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother, who also had the habit of pushing men for money. An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the beginning melancholy, with Nilsson playing in the opening credits of his deceptively flowery "Everybody's Talking"; We feel that even when we want Joe to make his mark on the city, the odds are high, he will not and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job - shown in a masterful shot from his point of view later in the movie, while he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees. We know from his gaze that he does not want to end like this. <br /> <br /> A dark history of frustrated hopes, John Schlesinger creates astounding images of lost souls in the late 1960s, and in the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some kind of meaning to their lives in the illusory comfort of a dignified life. There is the implicit notion that they may have been lovers - Ratso is trying to hug Joe in the party scene and his final hug at the end certainly points to that - but this is essentially a movie of friends, one who can literally survive to the death and bring some form of hope to Joe, who in late Florida looks much changed, older, wiser.
