Anyone who finds this boring movie is a hopeless idiot who must stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies. This movie is fascinating and does not have a boring moment. Because? Because it is mainly composed of intelligent dialogue between real people in a time of crisis and details their efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! That's what characterizes almost every Rohmer movie, and that's why a lot of people do not like them. They prefer action. Okay, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to look for movies like this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky". Well, he is, but to me that's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also a talisman. Is there a more cheeky joke than "Hamlet?" Whenever the subject, or theme, of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts about values, there must necessarily be a discussion about those ideas and values, and that is basically what this film is. Aristocracy and noble birth versus egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends who undergo the final test when that friend takes what we believe to be the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who possesses this life is not so good or even despicable. (Has anyone ever heard of Dostoevsky, or "Crime and Punishment?") That's what this movie is all about. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. . Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as her second language, is especially brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this fascinating movie. This may be the last movie on this master screen.
