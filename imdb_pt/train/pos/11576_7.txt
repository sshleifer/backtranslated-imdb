He tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's really the perfect B-adventure of all time. In fact, it's a fun and adventurous adventure that, even with its flaws, captures your interest. It must have been the greatest movie of all time for the people who did it. Even if it was made in the 90's, it does not have a modern twist. It has more of the same feel than an old Errol Flynn movie had. Great adventure movies are again the big thing in Hollywood, but I fear the feeling in them will never be the same as those old movies had. This, on the other hand, only has the real feeling. You just can not hate it. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
