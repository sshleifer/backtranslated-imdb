Having watched this movie on Fox's movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can not think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday night and then cherish my two cents. Especially when you consider the lack of user feedback on this. Does every movie, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a movie like April Love is to remember the time from where it came, in this case the late fifties. The movies were practically a happy medium at the time. Theaters were devoid of tragedies, while the screens were filled with Technicolor films to keep people from the gray glow of the evil medium in a box called television. I do not know how many people were ripped out of the tube to see this, but she managed to get my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager. He has lived with his aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) in the country after being paroled for stealing a car. It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed seems to have lost his taste for life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick, who is on the farm, somehow bring Jed out of his lull. Story lines like this being what they are, Jed and Nick do not care much about each other, of course. Jed then proceeds to meet up with neighbors Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately Jed falls in love with Fran, and of course I do not need to tell you that Liz develops a crush on Jed. Then there is the subject of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who has become wild and has let no one deal with him since the death of Jed Jr. You could probably fill everything that happens from that point on your own, seeing as there are no surprises real. No matter, though, you will enjoy it anyway. <br /> <br /> As soon as you get past the image of Pat Boone, as a supposedly bad kid, you will not have problems with the rest of the world. movie. Considering this, Boone does a surprisingly good performance like Nick. Certainly the paper does not require much depth, but it is still a job well done when you least expect it. Like Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. At first, it is inaccessible and cold, but when it slowly warms up for Nick, we see that he is indeed a very good guy. Jeannette Nolan is a lot of fun as Henrietta, who is constantly playing the role of mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers and Hammerstein and has some opportunities to grace us with his singing talents. Like Liz, she's beautiful to look at, great to hear, and pretty funny at times. Dolores Michaels like Fran, who is a little more on the wild side, is equally entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is not a true medium character of connotation of any kind on the screen. . Not a real villain in the whole thing. Everyone is so friendly that you can not help but enjoy the movie. I really find it very refreshing, like putting your troubles behind and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a bit more plot and Technicolor in wide screen. The songs are mixed, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really enjoyed is that they did not go back to using blue screen scenarios during the horse racing sequences, and they are a little more fun and exciting because of that. In fact, you'll see the entire picture beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they did not skimp on that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed, as each one tries, in some way, to win the respect of others. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with a big movie. However, sometimes, instead of going to Disneyland, it only takes a good walk in the park, and that's what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My notes: B + <br /> <br />
