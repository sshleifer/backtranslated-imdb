Sitting on the front porch of his Burbank home, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size on every clothing except hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the greatest stuntmen. , said that every time Zorro put on his mask, he was the only one on the screen. <br /> <br /> That was a bit exaggerated: There were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in acrobatics. we can be pleased that it was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what tricks! "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is, as the comments here testify, one of the greatest series. It is exciting and generally very well done. Reed Hadley was a great actor, and as someone commented, he did a good job. <br /> <br /> But, I admit, it's the action that makes this movie so good. <br /> <br /> And what else can we expect, with the direction of the excellent team, Witney and English, with good music from the incredibly prolific William Lava (the list here is ours). says that he had no credits, but that is incorrect, the other composers listed here were really uncredited, and I do not know if they wrote any music - sounds like Lava), and with the villainy of, among others, great Charles King, and with dozens of small parts? Also worthy of note was a Tarzan radio villain, Jim Pierce, who was Edgar Rice Burroughs' son-in-law. (I recommend you read his mini-biography.) <br /> <br /> There's a chapter that slows things down, but damn, it's only a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you go through it. Well, you're back to excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a big thanks for presenting this excellent series, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank everyone involved that we can see it as a chapter-play, or serial, and not as a trimmed feature.
