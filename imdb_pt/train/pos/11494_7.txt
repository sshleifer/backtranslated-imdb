The Unborn is a production of Roger Corman and, as such, is unpleasant and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it's full of preggo murders and failed abortions. Brooke Adams stars as Virginia. Her husband and her hip go to some extravagant fertilization clinic because they can not have children on their own. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling had a very high success rate in conceiving couples. (Insert joke here.) Is it because it's creating some supermutant genetic killing babies? This is what Virginia begins to think of when she starts having some weird side effects and extreme bad mood of treatment. That's when she begins to take matters into her own hands. <br /> <br /> In this, you will have to get the rest of the details elsewhere, because if I told you all the things you had, you could hurt yourself by putting it in your Netflix rental queue very quickly . It's a bit slow for a while, but once it picks up in the final third, all systems are ready! Very highly recommended by me about the strengths of your non-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 of seventeen stars.
