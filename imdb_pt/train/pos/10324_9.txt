Outragously entertaining period piece set in the thirties, it's a turn in the classic cliffhanger series as far as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", made only with a low budget and very campier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes feature a liberal amount of Gothic art, preceding Batman for two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly scaled hero and the beautiful Pamela Hensley as the local Latin Mona marking our hero on a gold hunt in the nonexistent Latin American country of Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, holding a punch to the chin, just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler blackhat of ham and cheese, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Wait a bit "Raiders ..", a dash of "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a lot of campiness and you will get it all right. Stay tuned for Michael Berryman's favorite cult in a small part as a funeral director and take advantage of the overuse of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. One of the leading candidates for the DVD release is certainly late. A treat not to be missed for the whole family. 9/10
