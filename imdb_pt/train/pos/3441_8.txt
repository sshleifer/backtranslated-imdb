This film is incredibly realistic and I feel great justice to crime that many people do not understand for lack of experience. The many people who think they can understand what goes through the victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in his role as Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This looks at the rape from a different point of view, more realistic than any other movie I've ever seen on the subject. The end dragged on a bit, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the chances of an attacker being arrested for their crime are around 1%. It's good to see a movie that gets closer to reality than most would dare to do.
