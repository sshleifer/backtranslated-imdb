Based on a true story, this series is a gem within its kind. The slave who becomes queen capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil, the diamond commander - appointed by the king of Portugal - is the final authority. Having grown up in the relative safety of her home, young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a brothel in the city, refusing to acknowledge that a black slave could be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commissioner to the king, with the intention of using them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the next day, however, and when the loot appears missing, the diamond keeper is taken in chains, his family stripped and thrown out on the street with only his clothes on his back. Martin, the son of the diamond promoter, vows revenge. Xica and the other slaves, however, are sold at auction, and Xica ends up at the sergeant's house, an old man who bought her just to satisfy her lust. For the city of Tijuco, however, comes the new diamond commander, the elegant and ruthless Jo√£o Fernandes. Immediately struck by the beauty of Xica, he manipulates the sergeant to sell her to him. And so begins a love story, full of dangers, intrigues and passions, between an intentional noble and a smart slave who rises to one day become queen. <br /> <br /> The series is full of rich details of the time. beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And this really captivates your attention for every minute. Sometimes funny with a sarcastic and somber humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
