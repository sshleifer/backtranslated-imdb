In the Netherlands, a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a talk. He spends the night with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (imagining she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but takes a look at a photo of Christine's handsome boyfriend, Herman (Thom Hoffman), and decides to stay to try it on. Then things get weird. <br /> <br /> A great house of successful art in the United States in 1983. Why was it rated X? Let's see ... there is bottleneck, total male and female frontal nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and It's all a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did it after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by critics for their extreme sexual sequences and denounced as junk. So Verhoeven filled this film with a very obvious symbolism, thinking that critics would think it was art and would praise it. Was he right! Critics loved the film without realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed by Jan de Bont (now a director) and there's so much symbolism and obvious layers "hidden" in the dialogue that you never get bored. All acting is great - Krabbe plays a totally despicable character, but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is simply dazzling to see and plays his role perfectly - the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is creepy; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body - he deserves credit for making the church sequence and go with Krabbe in the crypt. <br /> <br /> This is not for people easily offended or weak-hearted, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way.
