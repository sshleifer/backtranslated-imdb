Panned by critics at the time, but loved by fans, this movie has become a classic. Mixing supposedly "surreal" scenes filmed at John Lennon's house, among other places, with live footage of Marc Bolan & T.Rex at its best, this film is not just a must for everyone who likes Marc Bolan, but gives a fascinating view of the season <br /> <br /> These were the times when Marc was enjoying the likes of Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who directed] and you might even find a brief moment of a record by Reg Dwight [Elton John for you] the ivories in an incredible [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and ballads and ballads versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes with Chelita Secunda [said to have created 'glam rock' with his use of glitter, etc.], Mickey Finn and even the Catweazle actor! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining room table, sits cross-legged in front of a string section and eliminates acoustic versions of classics like Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly, highly recommended !! FIVE stars [of five]. <br /> Rory
