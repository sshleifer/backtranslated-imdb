Master cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with the actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see members of the Resnais family like Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant dealing with serious themes like death, religion, suicide, love and its global implications in our daily lives. The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends, they treat each other using a formal you. In 1984, while doing L'amour à mort, Resnais handled the time, memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence: is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago, in 1968, that Resnais made a film similar to Je t'aime Je t'aime, which was also about love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can even embarrass science. the dead lovers regain their lost lives, leaving the doctors to take care of their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is not at all didactic. It is a film in which the musical score is in perfect harmony with its imagens.Essa is one of the reasons why this film can be easily captured.
