gone in 60 sec. where I started, he keeps you in the movie with a good deed and some cool cars. People say it's not a good movie that I disagree certain that has some cheese parts, but what the action movie does not. I gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of action and the comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off than this movie is entitled to its dose of alley cage a good job along with one of the most underrated actors in my mind Del Roy Lindo. I think sometimes people look far into movies, sometimes you need to sit down to enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself that they have achieved what they show. ie if they were going to action was action pact. if they are trying to make a movie to change the way the movies are made and trying to win all the awards? I think they did the action movie they set out to do, give it a try and you will not regret it.
