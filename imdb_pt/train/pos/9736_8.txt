Pegg has had some successes in recent years, beginning with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, movie for "Hot Fuzz 2007", in early 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes this, "How to lose friends and alienating people "which is, in many ways, one of my favorite comedies of the year. The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a bankrupt magazine that makes fun of most celebrities because he is not one of them. Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played by Jeff Bridges) invites him (out of nostalgia) to work on his magazine. Sidney is of course excited and moves to America, there he meets a girl currently writing a book, and hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope more will be released in the near future. Pegg once again gave people everywhere another good movie and I can not wait to see the third part of the blood trilogy and "Paul" ice cream. I would rate this movie 81%.
