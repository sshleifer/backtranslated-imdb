Am I the only one who saw the connection between Camus's discussion 'the myth of Sisyphus' and the life of Mary? in the camus version, a man is doomed to spend his eternity with a giant stone that he must curl up on a hill. unfortunately every time he reaches the top, the stone slides and ends back in the background for him to begin. There may have been a vulture pecking your eyes, I'm not sure now. in the film, Maria spends her life struggling to get her life together, unfortunately every time she wins something she falls and loses everything. case in question would be the party she plays where she becomes intoxicated, offends her falafel lover and is almost attacked by liev schrieber. in case you question this theory, notice how this scene ends with it trying to scale a toss of stars as books fall out of nowhere to stop its progress until it finally faints. the next morning, when she wakes up, she is still on the stairs, never having reached the top.
