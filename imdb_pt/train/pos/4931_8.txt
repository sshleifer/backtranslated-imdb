When the plague erupts in New Orleans, it is Richard Widmark for the ransom in "Panic in the Streets", one of the lesser famous films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps up the pace, and there are many wonderful touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene at the police station show family life and work life and the relations of ordinary citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the life and the relations of the low-life people, portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak man yes, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has some scenes with actors that seem to get to their knees in height. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful and the dialogue is clear if the story is not successful. for direction and performances. There are some questionable aspects that will be seen by the viewer quite easily. Also, worth seeing. Kazan was a masterful director.
