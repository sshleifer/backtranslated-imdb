The people who are speaking ill of this movie are those who do not understand the movie to begin with. These are the people who love blockbusters of movies and adverse to any movie that is not starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a little movie that may sound weird and maybe even stupid at first, but what's missing in the plot is more than compensating in substance. <br /> <br /> One particular thing about the movie that impressed me was the use of music, which plays an important role. Those movie music students will note the importance of the song in the film, both in Vida's life and in Wilder, and in the background. Wilder's theme, the theme of Life and the theme of Wallace are all heard in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some of the lyrics appear. For example, in the scene where the men are singing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like "She is my girl", and then she goes to Wallace to give her something when men sing lyric " She will be my girl "cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers. There are all sorts of little complexities like that within the movie, and although it seems like a failure outside, the real movie student will notice how good this movie really is.
