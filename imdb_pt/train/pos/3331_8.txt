Of course, I do not know anything about baseball, nor am I a fan of the sport, but that did not stop me from enjoying the Farrelly brothers' last film, Fever Pitch, a charming and irreverent romantic comedy. The movie is not really about baseball; instead, it's really about relationships and the emotional disconnect that can often occur. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? giving its best performance to date? stars like Ben, a nerd teacher, slightly nerdy. Ben is a kind of boy-man, who unfortunately never really grew up, and promotes an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to the Sox and does everything from the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to the decoration of every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia. <br /> <br /> One day, while doing his geometry class on a field trip to his office, Ben meets Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a corporate, career-oriented girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that Ben finds totally captivating. He initially hesitates to invite her out, thinking she's out of his "class", and Lindsey does not immediately see a potential partner in Ben. <br /> <br /> Their first encounter begins with a disastrous start. when Lindsey is hit by a severe case of food poisoning? and his resonant vomit provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a movie of the Farrelly brothers. Instead of accepting Lindsey's request - quite urgently - to reschedule, Ben stays around to be a nurse, orderly, and janitor. So Ben rubs the toilet and the dog's teeth while his love interest is passed with a bucket next to his bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him sleeping on her couch, she begins the long and incisive process of dismantling the web of anxiety and status ambition she considered as her standards. Soon they are falling in love, with Lindsey cheerfully accepting Ben's fanatic devotion to his sport. <br /> <br /> Having inherited season tickets from his beloved uncle, Ben arranged his life around the season ?? he never missed a game. But their relationship, which progressed smoothly during the winter, hits a hurdle early in the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like a vacation with his parents and partying with his friends. , but Ben begins to have problems modulating his interest in finding Lindsey in the middle of the way. Can Lindsey indulge her irrational devotion to the boys of the summer to make their relationship work? Can she really accommodate Ben's passion for sports? Can a stubborn and nerdy Red Sox fan find true love after all? Of course Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of friends holding opinions. Lindsey's strictest friend, the skinny, rich, blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30. But Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione) Skye ) provides a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. Ben's eccentricity can be applied to just about any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations may be representative of any career-oriented woman. Fallon is fantastic as Ben, exhibiting great potential for big screen, overcoming the not insignificant challenge of preventing Ben from being unfriendly. Barrymore, on the other hand, is equally charming as the workaholic Lindsey, particularly as she struggles to accept Ben as he is, without losing sight of his own needs. <br /> <br /> The Fever Pitch really works, and although there are many things. of inspired comedic moments, the film also addresses the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory. Much of the film was filmed at Boston's Fenway Park, which adds a sense of authenticity to the process as well as the gaming environment, while fully appreciating what happened to the team will likely be limited to Baseball fans. Even so, Fever Pitch is blessed with such an elaborate and cleverly funny script that even novice baseball fans will find plenty to hook up with. Mike Leonard September 5th.
