In fact, I never bought the metal was satanic and things like that, but this kind of movie touched on that idea. While it's certainly not a movie to be taken seriously or very loud, it serves its purpose as it entertains while it's playing. The story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said that the band begins to go to the beyond the grave. So, yeah, a bit of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" plot going on here. Granted Freddy never molested a girl in a car before. There was another movie with a heavy metal band, but it was very different in the way it played a band that kind of dominated a city of boys and drove them crazy. This simply makes the band fan help the killer spirit at first then trying to stop it. Nothing horrible about that, for I do not remember so many bloody deaths. Frankly, the scene I most remember is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some incarnation of the band. Nothing great, but a good filling time.
