I just saw Behind Bedroom Doors, and this was the first softcore movie with a solid story behind it that I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> We started with two neighbors - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a competing attorney for the public prosecutor, Lillian works in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Has it all? Now let's get into it. <br /> <br /> Get into Abby, played beautifully by the porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents the house across the street from Fenway and lives alone. At the beginning of the film, James looks out the window and sees Abby in the middle of the joke with her girlfriend, Gigi (played by the prolific pornstress Monique Alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby becomes familiar with all four, and seems to be a good woman who happens to be living an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass to Vivian, who looks scared and says to her, "Oh ... I'm not like that." Everything seems fine ... until the plan is put into action. <br /> <br /> First, Abby appears in Gabe's office, naked, asking Gabe if she should get a busty job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: "Tell me about Gabe." "What you want to know?" "Gabe is happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ... let me guess. Your wife stays at home and does everything you ask for, but she's a good girl." "Yes." "Is not she a bad girl?" "Not." "Does that door have a lock on it?" <br /> <br /> You know what happens next ... Abby starts with Gabe, right there in the exam room. After that, she does a little show in her showcase for James, who comes and does not waste time having sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the blinking red eye is really a camera recording all the festivities (it's so obvious anyway). Abby has sex with Gabe again later, and this time Gigi joins to make it a trio. Now that Abby has something about the two men, she asks $ 100,000 each to buy her silence. Not only could she ruin James' candidacy for the job, but she could destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> As Gabe and James fight with their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian - who "experimented" women in college. . That was a long time ago, but you would not know to see her in action with Abby - she looked like an old pro. <br /> <br /> While Gigi goes along with the plan, she seems jealous of everything. the sex your girlfriend is having. "It's just a business," says Abby. Confessions and apologies will surely come as well as some surprising information about Abby's true identity - it seems she's doing the same thing with different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight against Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, for sex. The sex scenes were very good, and considering that all the women involved in this movie, except Julia Kruis, have a long history of pornography, I would not have expected anything less. The four scenes of Nicole Sheridan were the best in the film, with the three-way coming in second place. Monique Alexander only got naked once, but she was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was an important character and was naked the same number of times. I suppose since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore professionals, she did not have to have as many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To conclude, "Behind Bedroom Doors" had a great story, which improved the overall rating. of the movie. I find this interesting. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good in this movie - better than her later offerings in Fred Olen Ray's comedies. At least she can do drama a little.Blue Blue was a scene thief - she was not as bad as the antagonist.I would give her an A by herself.Julie Kruis was her usual self.I wish Monique Alexander had more face time in this movie, though.) <br /> Gender: B ( <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> The performance of Chelsea Blue was good for the genre, and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's turn in the drama.) Story: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall: B (This was a good softcore film. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I was able to watch this movie, as I was pleasantly surprised <br /> <br /> If Chelsea Blue wanted to do more, it would be fine I do not care about hardcore girls who can play softcore movies.)
