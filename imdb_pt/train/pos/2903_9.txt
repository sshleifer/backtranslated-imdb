Tiempo de valientes is a very entertaining action comedy.After its great film called El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV program Los simuladores, Damian Szifron did another great job.Time of the brave seems, at times, a movie made in Hollywood. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here they have great performances.The film is very fun and funny and has superb moments.Time of brave is a very entertaining action comedy that I totally recommend if you want to have a great time . And I have to congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has. Rating: 9
