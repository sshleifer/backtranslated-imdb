The first time I found Delirious, I just heard. I listened to all the comic performance and never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious images in our minds and make a great imitation is captivating. When I finally got to see him perform this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance in Delirious shows his genius! Being the new millennium, his actions in 1983 are as funny today as they were at the time. My parents loved them as teenagers and I (eighteen) love them too. From that point on, I had to see other Murphy films, such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
