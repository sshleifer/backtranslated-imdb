This is an astounding and powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends its source material to become something more daring and original. (Interestingly, Camus also credits Cain's novel as the key inspiration for his novel The Stranger.) The film has more power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex exploration of the genre. Cain's American novel is also fascinated by the disbelief of white construction (the main character Cora is obsessively afraid of being identified as Mexican and ashamed to marry a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is . This allows class antagonisms to occupy the center of the stage and dance between the embers of the passionate and doomed love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complex experience, full of suspense and gratifying.
