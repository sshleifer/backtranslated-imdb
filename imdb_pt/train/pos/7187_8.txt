The serials were short, originally screened in theaters, along with a feature film related to the serialized fiction of pulp magazine. Known as "chapters," they were extended films divided into several segments called "chapters" or "episodes." Each chapter would be shown in the same theater for a week. The series would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the most recent dangerous situation from which there would be no escape. <br /> <br /> The public would have to return next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and fight the villain once again. The serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the twentieth century, a typical Saturday on film included a chapter of at least one series, as well as cartoons, newsreels and two feature films. <BR> <BR> The golden age of the serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the best of the season. Zorro has been seen in many movies, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was excellent in the role. <br /> <br /> Action is constant, and we are taken chapter by chapter until the last end, where we discover the identity of the evildoer. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs, as he always does.
