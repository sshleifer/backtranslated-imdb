I highly recommend this movie. Set in the future Bladerunner-Esquire of 2054 Paris, it is in the most respect a classic film noir script: Lady in Peril, Sister Trying to find her, honest cop fighting everyone. Fortunately, it avoids being stereotyped and combines a good plot with interesting and innovative visuals. The film may remind you of Sin City in appearance, but it has a clearer and even more graphic look that I found really appealing. Each frame, each sequence looks like it could have been taken off the desk by a skilled graphic designer. In terms of history and art, you can find reviews from the 40's (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca as well as look into a bleak future where our destinations are ruled by corporations. Make any excuses you need to see this movie.
