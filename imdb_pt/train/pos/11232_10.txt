Okay, so the first few seasons took a while to go forward in special effects mode, but from the beginning, Hidden Frontier consistently gave good story lines and performances, and was always willing to make mistakes. They advise people to see the latest episodes first, so they can see how good the show is and understand how much that has changed since the early episodes. The cast has a fantastic camaraderie and is displayed on screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with the fans also attests the show, as the stories go from strength to strength. The program pushed the barriers with its various plots - depression, drug addiction and homosexuality - and this may have hurt some people, but that's what Star Trek is and was all about. Picture these stories intelligently and emotionally, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some characters from the Trek story, but they did them justice - characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, widely underutilized in the program, had a renaissance in the New Frontier books, but they lost their breath after a while when Peter David, when more to the wild fantasy versus serious science fiction, and HF shows these characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. They launch bloopers for each episode so fans can see what laughter they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many eye-popping professional actors in a state of shock! <br /> <br /> What this series, now coming to an end after 7 years, has achieved with such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of incredible - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. HF will live for a long time after they finish, as long as people still enjoy the motive that started in the first place.
