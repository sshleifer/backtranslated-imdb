Like many series riders, the Dark Angel opener shows a mix of great potential and a small problem in finding your own feet. Not that this is unusual in any way, but there is the feeling that it might have worked better if the story was stretched and focused a bit more. In today's world, where something has to catch instantly or face the cancellation, the series did a little disservice by not leaving at least half way, with all weapons on fire. <br /> <br /> The ninety minute pilot really feels like two episodes spliced ​​together, and both episodes have a problem with focus. In the first semester, we are introduced to Max and fill in what drives her. We also get some interesting routines with Max using his skills to win bets, interacting with a PI, or solving domestic problems of co-workers. The problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise. <br /> <br /> It is when we come to the second time that we have a story with purpose and focus. Along the two halves, Max finds himself in the spotlight of a pirate journalist who feels it's mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time. In the second half, the repercussions reach him, and Max reluctantly clears the resulting mess. This sets the premise for the rest of the series, and it works, but it does not click a lot if you understand my meaning. It's as if most of the pieces were there, but some who make a complete picture were left out. Maybe they're filled with later episodes, but that's irrelevant. The fact is that the content of this episode could easily have been counted twenty-eight minutes less. <br /> <br /> The last of the bad points is that much of the support cast is totally unpleasant. Original Cindy, in particular, is a hassle, and I doubt that has changed over the next twenty episodes. While acting is not as bad as daytime soap, it is not of such a quality that I would recommend it. Jessica Alba is not the worst actress in the world, but can not be convincing when the story less accurate. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the premise and production values ​​are all top of the line. In fact, this series was considered rather expensive to produce, and it's unfortunate that it was canceled to be replaced by another show that did not last a whole season. Especially when there was enough time for the two shows - they could have simply canceled one of the insulting bits of trash they displayed under the banner of the reality show. The fact is that we need more programs like Dark Angel, where imagination is used to get attention. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave the Dark Angel pilot seven out of ten. It never rises above the level of disposable television, and has never had the chance to live up to the potential it shows at its own time of execution. But the potential is there, and is often all that matters to the riders.
