One of the most interesting films to be classified as "blaxploitation", "Coonskin" by Bakshi, is a rich text and full of wonderful ideas. He wrote in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. Racist images can often be disturbing, but the message from the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave it an endorsement (but only unwillingly). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a movie. examination of the pervasive atmosphere of racism that Bakshi tries to deconstruct. Wonderful things.
