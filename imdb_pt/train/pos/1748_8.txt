From the beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm in September. <br /> <br /> All elements have joined together in this movie so beautifully. It's not often that you see a movie with so many penis, gay and racial jokes so highly praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver every raunchy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the movie, where by the end of the movie you're hoping for him to succeed in your relationship more than you are to fuck him. The supporting cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with their own ladies. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we get. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie will often be lifted when the words "waxing" and "condom" are mentioned in the conversation. Watching in the theater, I was amazed at how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four women from the mid-60s arriving. Despite an older audience, this movie still filled the whole laughter of theater. <br /> <br /> I think the kind of person who will like this are the fans of the office and Steve Carell. Many of the jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you see in Family Guy as well. The film is shallow enough for teenage boys and yet sweet and clever enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend going to this movie if you're not a fan of swearing or if you're easily offended. However, when you are in the movie, remember that this movie is all in a good mood. Jokes are not "gay jokes", they're just jokes. And they are funny.
