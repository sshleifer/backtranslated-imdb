Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break the glass ceiling of direction in Hollywood under the system of studio. Not surprisingly, she also addressed proto-feminist themes which, when touched upon, were approached so delicately that it was seldom clear what was being said. In Outrage, she addresses rape and its consequences, and despite being described as "criminal aggression," it leaves, at least once, no doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays a secretary-bookkeeper in a large industrial factory; she lives with her parents, but is involved with an incredible guy (Robert Clarke), who just got a raise and now earns $ 90 a week. Leaving the plant after working late one night, she finds herself being chased. In the next scene? The best of the movie? she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding labyrinth of buildings and alleys, but fails. <br /> <br /> When she returns home, disheveled and in shock, the police can not get much of it; she claims that she never saw her assailant (who took care of a snack truck outside the factory). Trying to pretend nothing happened, she returns to her work, but collapses, thinking that everyone is looking at her, judging her. She enters a state of flight, fleeing to Los Angeles on a bus, but stumbling on a rest stop. <br /> <br /> Waking up in a strange farm house, she learns that she was rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister in a farming town in California. She lies about her identity and accepts a packing job for oranges. The two fall in love vaguely, but it is clear to Andrews that Powers is holding terrible secrets. When, at a company picnic, she picks up a wrench and breaks the skull of Jerry Paris, who was trying to steal a kiss, the truth about her past is over ... <br /> <br /> It was a brave movie to come out in 1950, and this may explain and excuse some of their shortcomings. Lupino never recaptures the verve of the scene of precocious assault, and the film is diverted to the bucolic and sentimental, finishing with talisman and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to convey, but she did not trust the narrative to speak for herself. His cast, pleasant, but bland and generic, did not help either, reverting to melodramatic postures or a simple tranquility. But Outrage was a breakthrough, paving the way for later talk about what rape crime really is, and what it really means for its victims.
