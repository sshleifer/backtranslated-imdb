I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before seeing this miniseries. I had read and watched many classics before, and I believed that most of the classics were boring, over-hyped and overrated stories with moderately interesting graphics at best. This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress, and she presents a wonderful portrait of Jane Eyre. Her accent is charming, and her quiet but firm nature corresponds exactly to the character of the young housekeeper. Timothy Dalton is an incredible Rochester. His passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the master of Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after I watched this miniseries. The plot is astonishing and inspiring. The characters are masterfully performed and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre to appear in the movie. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was impressed by how much this miniseries followed the writings of Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.
