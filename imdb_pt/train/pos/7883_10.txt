I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I mean, there was nothing scary about this movie! It was funny all the lines that Freddy said were hilarious! I do not think they should even have made a new nightmare and gone to Freddy Vs. jason Although some parts were thick (like the head exploding). and any 1-5 elm street movie sucked. this was the best beyond number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to rent this and you will laugh a lot. I want to see the Texas Chainsaw Massacre I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead The overall rating of the Final Nightmare: B-
