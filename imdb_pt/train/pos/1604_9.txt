I'm really surprised that this movie does not rank higher on IMDB. It's one of those movies that could easily go through someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really in a class by itself. It's scenery and ethnic charm are things that people seem to take for granted. The cast just makes a near perfect movie. Few movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's funny too. **** outside of *****
