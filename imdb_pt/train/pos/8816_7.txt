Given the nature and origin of the 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is, at best, neutral in its stance toward America. Probably the most "anti" segment comes from Ken Loach, who is definitely not towing the British line of the New Labor Party. While these one-year events are shocking and painful for most Americans and most viewers who watched them unfold live on CNN, etc. most writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly. One should be surprised that these 3000 deaths carry the same weight elsewhere, as the West gives thousands of victims Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnia, Chilean, Kurdish (we must continue). If this was a wake-up call for states, then it is equally tragic that in the next 12 months the impasse between Israel and Palestine is further from a solution while George Bush Jnr. would rather take revenge than make the world a safer place. I think many contributors wonder where the Founding Fathers' idealism was, and why America originally built as a bastion of freedom, justice, and tolerance now sees its primordial selfishness as the Third World imagines where the next drink, meal, or bullet is coming.
