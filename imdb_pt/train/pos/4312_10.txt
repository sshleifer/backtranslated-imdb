If you have not seen this great movie about life in the '90s (Los Angeles), you've lost a special treat. This is one of the most incredibly powerful films ever made about life for Americans in the 1990s and still applies to the world we live in today. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. and the list goes on. This story accumulates to a final climax and, when nothing else matters, always returns to love with friends and family and love of life. It helps us dig deep into ourselves and make us seek what we want out of life. It causes us to ask questions of ourselves. Have we done enough for others, are we, etc? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully made and emotional movie that, for sure, others will enjoy for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Take note of the wonderful performance of Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover throughout this film. These actors are incredible and really show the true brilliance and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this movie more than 10 years ago now. I still like it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and be sure to count how many times you see the helicopter flying over and trying to figure out the symbolism of the movie ... hmmm ... I almost forgot that this is probably the first serious Steve Martin role in any film he's ever made. He also does a great job in this movie. This may come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy a truly good cinema .....
