Unfortunately for me - I stumbled on this show at the end of its life. I just picked up a few episodes (about three) before being canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and plot - but most of all the great actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was "The Character" Todd was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan ) I like to see young actors get what they deserve, and I felt that this show would boost their career even more.I hope that at least that's put back on DVD, and maybe the WB will pick it up for a second season some day? Meanwhile, I've been seeing this on the ABC website from the beginning.
