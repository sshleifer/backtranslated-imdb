Fast, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel enchants you with your intelligence and energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the insinuation in the script, the costumes and the way they are played. And bikinis before bikinis! This is not a grace for everyone. I do not understand the question of John Garfield though. Does it matter if he's in this movie or not? If it is, the screen is so short that it is basically a prop. You need to watch him frame by frame to find him if he is there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen it before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it by accident marvelous. Sit down and enjoy the ride!
