This film is a fun and totally sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed with the photograph which consisted of vivid colors and handling settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> A warning, do not take the message of the movie so seriously. Not for mass consumption (and this is not a compliment). The message is a postmodern and neophyte vision of society, somewhat stylized. <br /> <br /> I liked the basic plot of a fictitious zine editor who verbally lashed the mobocracia of the 90s.
