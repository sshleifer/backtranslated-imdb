I liked this movie. It's another Yash raj movie that you know will look good on the screen, all the characters are always cool or cool, with one exception that you know will eventually be cool ... Another rule of the Yash raj movie is that both hero how much heroin s only has one or no parent. Think back to all these movies .. MPK Suman had no mother, HMAPK Salman had no parents, And the final rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> The movie is also good. It is a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it makes you smile often enough. The little boy (hero's nephew) is well positioned and provides a very good coat. The actress is very pretty but shy you would not get it in real life. This movie does not have large happy families living in the big house which I was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There is not a strong message from this movie, but it is a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage), the movie will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not he will inform and it may be scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall, a very beautiful film. There are no big plots or twists, but a very nice film, much like the Bollywood classic.
