A great British Indy movie! The fantastic chemistry among the 3 main characters causes some hilarious drug-filled pieces to check Cheech and Chong. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he switched sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! I loved the final fight scene with the nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set fire to Top of the Pops! ... he's not acting ... he's really a British hippie in good faith !!! You do not have to be a biker to take advantage of this and it's straight to my Friday Night Aftermath replay preview collection. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed.
