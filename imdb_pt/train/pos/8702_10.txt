A woman was a boy to this world and she was alone. They were both alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in a package - he was able to take the sword off his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside his body. First he kills his constantly drunken stepfather who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his true father. As simple as all the time for a superhero - he comes to justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is really right, because it's not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not tries to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the main hero represented by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person that, in his opinion, deserves to die, but is guilty by the authorities and runs. In such an escape from the authorities and the Mafia, he meets a girl (represented by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else should be noted ... not counted. Be aware that this movie is more about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This movie is full of pain from the main character filled with him and his vision of life.
