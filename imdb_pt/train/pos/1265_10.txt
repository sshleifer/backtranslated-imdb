hi .. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite films of Sean Connery, is a taut psychological thriller with excellent performances by the cast, especially Connery .. also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is very good at a gift .. it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when Sean Ed Harris character interview in prison is simply fant√°stico..eu enjoyed this and I can not recommend it enough, really do not miss this! Do not pay attention to negative comments stating that the last 30 minutes are bad, it was as intense as the rest of the film, I really think Just Cause a very entertaining movie ..
