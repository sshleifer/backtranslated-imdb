I do not care how many bad reviews the purple rain gets, this movie rocks! Excellent movie, has it all, good music (Prince of Crude!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad, very moving film. I do not want to say much more, I will not give up the plot, but I will say it - the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, many familys are similar to the one described in the movie. I see this as being very realistic and being so real, it makes the film much more exciting. My generation loved this movie, many of us love Prince and there is so much to relate to any teenager who went through similar problems. <br /> <br /> That said, it's definitely not just a teen movie. Id would recommend it for all age groups. And not everything is so dark, the film has great songs, scenes of performance of the band and scenes fun and sensual between Prince and Appelonia.
