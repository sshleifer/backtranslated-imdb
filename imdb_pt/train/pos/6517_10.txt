I'm afraid it was a movie that you really DO get to get something out of it. It's not a foolish movie like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" Do you know where Riggs is really crazy? it's not a movie that's pretty much the same in the end as it's the beginning. you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and have fun anyway. I've noticed in the past that most people who do not like this type of movie are the type who will do nothing but watch a movie and then knock because duh do not understand, nor understand or what happened. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LET YOUR DOGGY TAKE A SHOWER !!!
