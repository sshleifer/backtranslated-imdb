The Internet database relates this as a TV show. And yes, it was an MTV show on the show "Oddities," after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" as I remember. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes together in a movie without annoying credits in the middle or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a superhero or a vagabond, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should hear less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone, a guy who seems unable to keep his head. And then there are the other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and what are the dreams. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Maybe just one exists and dreams of others. You'll have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had the comics before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The work of art was spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It will double your mind and have strong adult implications without being obscene or offensive. And the show used basically the same exact work of art (only now it moves) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty intrinsically found in the comics was faithfully reproduced. This was the best show to appear in "Oddities", hands down. <br /> <br /> If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. It's "Donnie Darko" before there was something like that. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is that this has never become more a movie or a television series, but I do not say this in disappointment. By keeping it simple, they sealed this film in gold and kept it free from blemishes caused by successive failures.
