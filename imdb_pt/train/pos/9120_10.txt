This film speaks a universal language; it can be related to the self, to the community, to society or to the wider world. He has a way of not only opening up several issues but also setting one in search of finding out and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self-belief / ownership. The picture of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us, which must be recognized as the repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposing force of innovation, creativity, and growth. Factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be apparent and countered. The idea is definitely a movie to be experienced and not just seen as it touches the voice / inner awareness of someone through the look, it makes someone feel as opposed to just watching.
