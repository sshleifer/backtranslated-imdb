I was not expecting the highest caliber of making films with Joel Schumacher directing this film, so I was surprised that the TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In technique, it is often derived from SAVING. PRIVATE RYAN with unsteady camera work, gritty photos, the occasional movie acting as if jumping a sprocket - all those techniques that Speilberg used to make the film look more realistic, but in the end it was more upsetting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not so weak, as the characters in this film seemed more real people and the less artificial story, not so wrapped up in the American flag (Speilberg gets a ' F '). 'in subtlety). <br /> <br /> Next to the first section of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic portrait of the boot camp I've seen in a movie, and for that I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie, either.
