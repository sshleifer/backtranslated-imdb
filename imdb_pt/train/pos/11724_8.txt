Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. After she discovers that her dead aunt has left him some things, Elvira goes to England to pick him up, hoping it will be some money. But to her horror, Elvira learns that all her aunt left behind was her home, her dog and a cookbook. Elvira decides to install herself in the house anyway, but with her stunning dark looks and impressive features, she can not live in peace. All the neighbors are turning the whole city against her, and with the outrageous attitude and appearance of Elvira, it is best that everyone be attentive, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's so much fun watching Elvira on all these adventures, she's great. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, of course, it's silly and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to watch it. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
