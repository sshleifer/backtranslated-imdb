Oscar caliber performance of Peter Falk on a paper written in the caliber of the Oscar. I loved the subtle and balanced exploration of a long-term marriage - how often do we get this in the movies, where usually the movie ends when the boy and the girl get together? This is an adult film, a complex vision through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each has adapted to each other in the past and has grown during the story. Also, this gave me about 10 big laughs, and I'm one of those people who usually sit upright when the rest of the audience is laughing. This was one of the few really funny movies I saw. Great original jokes.
