It is written in stone that Disney animations should be musical. Right? At where? Show me. Because I found this attempt to be so much nicer to ~ not ~ containing the standard Disney music music made for five years. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as fascinating as it might have been, it was still very good, pleasant and adventurous. I expected a little more, yes, considering the subject matter, but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or the absolute failure that was announced. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite convincing, as well as the plot, the plot, the sub-plot and the incredible creativity that I found in this production. I will refrain from outlining the plot as it has been done and done, but this movie is well worth it if you are a fantasy fan. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney Long Length Longitudinal Movie. <br /> <br /> He ranks 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> the Demon :.
