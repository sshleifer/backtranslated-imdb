Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully exaggerated Michael Caine) would kill for a piece of success. Enter young wonder boy (a solid Reeve) who has just written such a play. Face Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you'll have a wonderfully funny thriller. <br /> <br /> Although it does not follow "Sleuth" standards, "Deathtrap" is, however, a very capable comic thriller ride full of twists based on a fantastic piece of Ira Levin. The artists are obviously having a field day with the material, with Caine in particular delivering top quality lines with gusto. <br /> <br /> The movie loses some steam in the middle and the ending is far less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play, but overall "Deathtrap" is a solid, well-represented and suspenseful fun.
