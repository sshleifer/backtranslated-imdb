Well, what can I say, plus these people are super in every way. I really like Sharon Mcreedy, I like this pure nostalgic series And I have the set of 9 discs 30 episodes, I did not realize they made so many, I also think it's a great shame, they did not anymore. I wish I had received those powers, Imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being chilled, then waking up in a special hospital. Later, I find that my body has been improved. So did Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you can not fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry. The song is well written, and for me, it puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind. The kind of powers that champions have is the same as our domestic dog or cats, improved vision, improved hearing and touch. and the force of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the force of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I had a huge fall for it !!!! Now I can see why, in my DVD set. The box is very good and comes with a free booklet on the series. I also thought that Trymane was a good boss, firm, but he did things!
