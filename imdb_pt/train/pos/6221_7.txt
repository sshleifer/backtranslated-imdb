If this movie had been set up a little better, it would be there with the best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a great but very long film with a tedious subplot, Randolph Scott, romanticizing Rogers's sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (this is Ozzie Nelson's wife for her baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two Navy men. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later, after Ginger Rogers asked her friend (a blonde but unmistakable, Lucille Ball) to glamorize her. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his former dance partner has stopped. The result is some wonderful dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team as well as separately: "I'm putting all my eggs in one basket", "Let Yourself Go" and "I'd rather lead the band." Hilliard is sweet, but a little lethargic like a plain Jane who has become a glamorous girl, though she sings her two songs well, "But Where Are You?" and "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" - a poster did not care about this song, but I love the title. Rogers is vivacious, and a young Astaire is a dynamo. The highlight of the film comes at the end with "Let's Face Music and Dance," one of the most painfully beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Astaire. In it, they symbolize the glamor and fantasy of the 30's. It's really to be valued and watched over and over again.
