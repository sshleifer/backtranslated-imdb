This is an incredible movie. I can not remember the last time I saw a Swedish film in layers. It's funny, it's tragic, it's attractive and, above all, it's a slice of life in the small Swedish town. He crushes the clichés and dwells more deeply. This makes you feel connected, not just to the main characters, but to all the characters. <br /> <br /> Girl from the big city, going back to her roots, her little hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing paths with people she has not met in years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (in different phases of life), who are not very close. Or at least they do not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that facilitate the connection with the people in this film is the immaculate cast. First of all, I am more than satisfied with the fact that there is absolutely no so-called Swedish 'first list' actors in this film. There are usually a handful of actors who have the ability to find their way in almost every major production in Sweden. This time, the producer managed to keep it real by selecting actors who really seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to prove that you do not need words to convey an emotion. <br /> <br /> The writing is also very attractive. The dialogue is more than believable, and compared to other Swedish films of the past year or two, it is advanced in miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you did not know, you would never have imagined that this is the first time she writes and directs a feature film. I can not wait for her next. <br /> <br /> When you start watching this, you really want to see it.
