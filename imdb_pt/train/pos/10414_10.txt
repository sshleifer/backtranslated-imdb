I first discovered the Fantasy of Alexander Korda (1940), THE BAGDAD THIEF in the early 1950s, in a reissue heralded as "The Wonder of the Century!" The two Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown in a program that will never be forgotten. The music of Miklos Rozsa improved both films. The Technicolor in every era was incredibly beautiful! The BAGDAD THIEF has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. Over the years, it has become more difficult to appreciate the color of the film the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor gave way to an Eastman Color suit in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film theatrically and on video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel colors and silenced the vivacity of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also looks pastel - good, but not as it should be. Now comes the M-G-M DVD edition (December 3, 2002). The BAGDAD THIEF again has the wonderful visual Technicolor on a DVD that is nothing short of AWESOME !!! It was so exciting to see this one more time that after watching the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only "extras" are a version dubbed in Spanish, English and Spanish subtitles and a very well done original theatrical trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only expect that Korda's book QUAR PENAS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace the public domain prints in circulation) will soon be followed on DVD.
