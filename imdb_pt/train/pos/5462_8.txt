Firstly, if you are planning to watch this, make sure you watch the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to come back and then watch the scenes that have been tampered with because of the censorship), it makes a huge difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who since the age of 14 was forced into prostitution by her own father. When her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world by herself. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophies about life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men to give her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. Throughout the film, she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if she has any sense of morality. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant sexuality scenes that most people would not expect to see in a black and white movie. Although no sexual act is explicitly displayed on the screen, it is very obvious what is happening outside the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I believe that most modern audiences will have at least some fun, especially with the shock value of the movies. I think while watching, the pace seemed a bit slow in some parts, but I think in most movies the first time is to watch them. In fact, I think that almost every movie I saw done in the early 1930s had some minor setbacks or certain parts just did not "flow" properly. This was probably just the craft of making movies has not been perfected yet? it would only take a few more years. Compare a 1939 movie and compare it to a movie from the early 1930s and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am very happy to have seen the original cut; It really makes a big difference. Also any fan of John Wayne will be surprised to see you in this movie before being famous in an uncharacteristic role.
