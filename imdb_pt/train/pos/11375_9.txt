This film tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the principal investigator, you will be in a trance. It is an absolute must for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relations and how agencies work together are also great. Not overly done either. I also recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Russia. How the police work with the political party being what it was ... It's truly fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been a while since I first saw this movie. It does not diminish impact. Not overly dramatic or graphic, leaves quite to the imagination as well, you will see.
