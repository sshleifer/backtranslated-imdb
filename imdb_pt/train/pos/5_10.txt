I got in the middle of this movie so I had no idea about any credit or even his title until I looked over here, where I see that he received a mixed reception by his commentators. I'm on the bright side regarding this movie, but one thing really caught my eye while I watched it: the beautiful and sensitive note written in an American Copland√©sque style. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score was written by none other than John Williams himself. It is true that he wrote sensitive and poignant scores, such as Schindler's List, but generally associates his name with such bombs as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams wrote for this film surpasses everything I've ever heard about his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, totally in accordance with the tender and lovable storyline of the film. And another recent score for Catch Me if You Can shows even more intelligence and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, the one with John Voigt and his young African-American accusations in South Carolina, and Danny deVito Renaissance Man, etc. They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story that can not be told quite often. This is an excellent addition to this genre.
