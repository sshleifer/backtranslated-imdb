Remember the first days of Pay Per View? I do, and I can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid, we always wanted to rent playboy, but that meant calling someone for PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the guts to do it and its watching four hours of soft core without crap angle. Well, the reason I bring this is because this movie was also on ppv. And I remember almost all the scenes that were in the supplement. I've been on a kick in the last few years to get all the great movies that I use to watch as a kid and this was one of them. It is one that when it is on your disk to shut down. All Star cast trying to commit the perfect bench bust, but nothing works out. There are many fake bank alcoves that are good and that has to fall into that category. You have enough action and laugh to support it. check it out if you dare!
