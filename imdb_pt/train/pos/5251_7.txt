Well, "Wayne's World" is long gone and the years since then have been difficult for short films. of cinematographic gimmicks like "It's Pat" to the recent 80-minute yawn, "A Night at the Roxbury," many have undoubtedly lost faith that any other skit will make a successful transition to the movie screen. Well, do not be afraid, because Tim Meadows comes in swords. the well-written storyline maintains the public's interest until the end, and while remaining true to Leon Phelps's character introduced in the five-minute sketch, the storyline allows the character to unfold. the humor (consisting largely of sexual jokes) is new and interesting and made me laugh more than I have in any recent memory movie. is a great time if you do not feel like you take it too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen's fame of "Saved by the Bell" makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally, Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the film a touch of class. and for those who are out of the market, like me, you'll see that this movie is eminently quoteable, "ooh, it's a lady!"
