The visual art of Tsui Hark is featured in this film. Unfortunately the terrible performance of Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her while watching it, it's so bad :) it made it difficult to watch at times. <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw this, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I had never seen anything remotely alike, but this is how it must be done to do justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical novels of kung fu. ! Undoubtedly this is one of the most beautiful Chinese historical kung-fu epics of all time. <br /> <br /> But Tsui Hark has not improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are quite youthful (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly long portrayal of the evil guys has not helped either). To make matters worse, this movie is very poorly released. They decided to use Hong Kong's hot "hot" idols as protagonists, but unfortunately Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally inadequate for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique these characters should incorporate. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I wish Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark someday join forces and produce a film that has the visual art of Tsui, but with Zhang's maturity and narrative poetry ...
