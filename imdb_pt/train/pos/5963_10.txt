This movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of it. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest chase scene ever. When Eddie messes with Tim, he's chased down the hall. Eddie places obstacles in the path of athletes with hilarious consequences (like a plate nailing a trumpeter, buy the DVD and watch it slowly). The best obstacle is a bucket of mop that a jock jumps, but begins to slide on the floor through a door. But when it slips, it picks up speed, challenging physics (especially friction); but what is behind the door is supreme. The steepest staircase of any school, that this athlete goes to CLEAR in the air. In fact, he would probably die of a broken neck. It not only challenges all concepts of reality but also makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me this scene is worth your $ 6.
