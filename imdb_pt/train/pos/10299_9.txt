I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed my butt off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious films, especially Truman Show. This is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side. He's naturally very funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he takes it very easily. he is truly a multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with the performance of Jennifer Aniston. I think she's more than just a couple of cool tits and big ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very cool god. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have to rate this as 9. Good acting, funny script and some very serious situations make this happen. a very good movie.
