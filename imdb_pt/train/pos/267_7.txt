It starts with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a student hostel on Hickory Road in London. Worried about her sister, who is the maid there, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to examine the matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes increase when a girl, who admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) robberies, is found dead. "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise without being as complicated as "One, two, buckle my shoe". Murder, theft and smuggling of diamonds are the crimes involved, and the final twist that unites everything is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, particularly psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Japp has his funny moments (maybe the closest in this series was the "bathroom humor"), and Miss Lemon is part of history than usual.
