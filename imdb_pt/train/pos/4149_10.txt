Reading some of the comments in the message boards here I was hoping this movie would be a complete disappointment - but when I watched this I could not help but laugh! It officially became my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what all the hate here is, maybe it's because such a movie has never existed before. I'm at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Many comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be many supporting male characters. This was almost ALL women - except for Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All the actresses made very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) of a peculiar and amiable script. <br /> <br /> The charm of this film seems to me to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships, and the breaking of gender roles. As carefree as it is, each of the protagonists faces a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values ​​and with who they themselves knew to be. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle proposed that this movie missed a theatrical release because of its female cast and lack of a big name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I recommended for this movie loved it and I find it a shame that a comedy that celebrates female behavior has not been widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has an open film. or a woman-centered comedy love.
