One of the most underrated movies I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. And Ted Theodore Logan, also known as Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this film: First, you see a stupid dialogue, an impromptu storyline, a youthful idea. OR .. You see brilliantly understated idiots who once again find themselves in a very big situation for their brains. Play a Bruce Willis or an Arnold Schwarzeneggar in this plot and it becomes a great blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity, just Bill and Ted. This is a tricky fence to balance, but when you watch the movie not as a disposable comedy, but as an adventure with two guys who have no reason to be on an adventure, it becomes so much more.
