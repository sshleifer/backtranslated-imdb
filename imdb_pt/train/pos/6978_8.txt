Well, I have to say I waited for him to come. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil it and some people really spoke brilliantly about the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not sure I understand the detractors who claim to be fans of BSG and not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did they expect? !! The background is settling 50 years before BSG was there to help with the birth of the Cylons, to see the life of the Adama family (we already know some of them from BSG), to get a deeper explanation of the Capricorn population and their perception of the other colonies and, potentially, the origins of God's belief in the human and the unique belief of the Gods of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same profusion of special effects or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, although I know that Caprica will reinforce the BSG. <br /> <br /> This is promising start 1h30, I also believe this will put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as the BSG. I hope very much of the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watching the deleted scene from the DVD also gives more material to the brain to chew. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
