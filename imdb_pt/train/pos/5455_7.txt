Infamous pre-coding film, really the only movie that made people insist that the Hayes Code was strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young woman whose father selling alcohol has no problem distributing it to clients. When he dies in an accident, she is released into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get what she wants. She goes to New York and continues to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although obviously there is no real sex shown, the film is rather contemptible. Unfortunately, after the initial value of the crash goes down (by the time Stanwyck punches a wagon inspector to be able to travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the movie worth it. As always, she's fantastic.
