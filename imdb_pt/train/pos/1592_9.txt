'What I Like About You' is definitely a show I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: 'The Amanda Show'. She is a very funny person and seems to be on the floor. "Holly" is such a capable person and has a personality "out there." I liked how she always seemed to change things and upside down, so she got in the way sometimes. But that's what made the show so good. <br /> <br /> I particularly loved the show when the character 'Vince' appeared. Nick Zano is very hot and funny as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. I particularly loved 'Lauren'; she is the best! She helped make the show funnier and you never know what she'll do or say next! Overall, the show is pretty good but the reason I did not give it 10 was because there are no more new episodes and because the episodes could have been longer and deeper.
