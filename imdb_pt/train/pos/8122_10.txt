I've never seen this movie until I bought the tape last year. I was fascinated and entertained. It has all the elements I like to see in a science fiction story, in a book or on the screen. There are social commentary, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something strange, and amusing, watching a 1936 vision of the "distant future" of the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see, not only for Sci-Fiers.
