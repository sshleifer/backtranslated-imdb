I went to see this movie twice in a week and can only sum it up in one word (which I usually do not use lightly): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscar and other awards, if not this Swedish team who created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when all that is said (and not said) throughout history is drawn together? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus evokes so many feelings and long feelings repressed within the people around him, the film does the same with its spectators: you leave with head shaken and your heart feeling full. Good stuff! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life," think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience, like In Heaven: happy, satisfied, satisfied. To say this to Mrs. Dalloway of Virginia Woolf: "Such moments are enough."
