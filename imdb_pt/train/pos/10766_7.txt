A fine story with lots of perfect photos. Eyecatchers here are the three ladies of D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy who accompanies them. Traci Lords convincingly plays the female half of an evil business couple who intends to poison the world with anthrax. Original in this film is the bra pump, put on a captured member of the team D.R.E.A.M. Of course she is rescued by a co-member, three seconds before the explosion. Although clearly borrowed from James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "You Only Live Twice," this climax always works well. All in all a good watch, James Bond replaced here by three Charlie's Angels.
