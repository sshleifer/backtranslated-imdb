I have not seen this movie for about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite movies, this is what I always mentioned first. There are certain films (works of art like this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lasting impression. in the spectator, not unlike a life-changing event such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shook me" when I first saw it. This left me with an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
