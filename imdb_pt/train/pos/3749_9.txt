I laughed a lot while watching this. It's a fun short with a fun musical act and a lot of craziness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity contributes to the stylization of humor. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything seems to flow wonderfully. There is Max, who apparently led a horrible life. And there's Edward, who is not sure of the life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss. Tom has a short but memorable role. Highly recommended for those who like silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all of Jason's cartoons and I can not wait to see what he comes up with next.
