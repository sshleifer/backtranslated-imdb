I was lucky enough to see this in a pre-selection last night (October 20) and I was incredibly surprised at the wonderful plot and genuinely the heart felt acting. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and distinctly "indy" in style. Not something that can be easily compared to movies from the past, it's a unique insight into a depressed classic middle-aged love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed with the release of the film. . Even the last of the family was a handsome and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly dispersed among them, and none of them "outdid" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a delightful movie, suitable for all ages and for laughing. loud at the same time, being truly touching and warming the heart. It was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and the nudity of recent films.
