Life Pod is one of those movies you watch and tries not to analyze too much. The acting is pretty amateur at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not so bad. The story line is a little stocky, but with an interesting twist. The computer is out of control, but not exactly a computer, and uncontrolled running is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still, the film has its moments and is quite watchable. For me, at least part of the fascination of this film is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the best actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she's cute enough. In every Life Pod it's a lot like other low budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> The White Star Lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. The last stock of White Star Lines Company was bought by Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the colors of White Star was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
