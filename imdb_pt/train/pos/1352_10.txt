I have never seen this movie and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors. By the time this movie was made, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today except Radio and the beginning of great movies being made in Hollywood. Innocent tales and sweet romance between a young man or a young man were viewed differently than it is today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet," 44 played a young orphan girl who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken to a home of two elderly people who were like two owls and looked after Ann Shirley . . It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened, the whole town found out about it in minutes. It's a realistic film with decent people trying to help each other in a very simple way. Today, it seems a lot of ball and stupid, but believe me, that's how people were in America during the 1920s. " & 30 and they were a great generation who loved good family movies.
