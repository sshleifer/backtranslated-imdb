I can not agree with any of the reviews. The first time I saw the movie on a UK TV channel, it was presented as a stand-alone film and if you take the film at that angle, I think it's a whole different subject. I could not believe what I was seeing and got hooked instantly. The plot can be as bad as a JS show (ie there is no plot), but the acting is wicked, it's hilarious and it's all an amazing rubbish movie. <br /> <br /> It says as much about the US as about a Bully or Ken Park without the prospect of drama, but it does give an idea of ​​American society and, more precisely, what late viewers in America (and I believe there are many of them!) are interested. After all, it's the neighbors we're talking about, is not it? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
