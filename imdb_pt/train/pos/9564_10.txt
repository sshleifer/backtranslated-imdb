This has to be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and an exciting plot, and you have a masterpiece. Dog Bite Dog held me on the edge of my seat during some scenes, retreating in horror during the others, and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The film left me with a deep impression. It is shockingly violent scenes contrast sharply with the pungent and tender scenes of 'love'. The film is unworthy of the Cat III rating (nudity); there are no scenes of nudity, and the scenes of 'love' do not involve kisses or 'kisses'. <br /> <br /> The message that this movie introduced me? All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side. Edison Chen does an excellent job playing the role of the Pang killer. <br /> I rated this movie 10/10. It's a watch.
