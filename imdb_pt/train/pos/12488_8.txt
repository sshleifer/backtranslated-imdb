I'm not fussy about horror movies, and I'm willing to watch just about any of them. This does not mean that I am willing to watch again many of them, or that I will not have criticism for them. This movie is creepy and very well done. Actually, I think this movie would make a great double project with Session 9. <br /> <br /> I should have specified, before coming to my comments, that I watched this on my own. I started watching him before going to bed and got about 15 minutes before realizing it was very effective, so I saved the rest of the morning. Even while watching in broad daylight, it was still scary. However, I can not guarantee how effective it would be to watch in a larger group. <br /> <br /> After his daughter's death, a couple moves to a remote booth as a means of trying to get terms with this death. Let me note this death - this is one of the rare films that do not escape the death of a child. This is much more important as both set the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not doing well. The wife has distanced herself from the relationship and her husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back. While some of the comments complained about their performance - one of them specified that they act more like father and daughter than husband and wife, and that is legitimate. He's trying to give you more direction. It's a role that men sometimes take. <br /> <br /> There are a variety of scares in the movie, and most are fairly non-violent, though grotesque in some ways. The story itself seems very straightforward for most of the film, and gives a weird twist near the end. While the turn is not absurd, it's certainly not what you expected from the way things were progressing. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well made for something that seems to have been shot on video.
