This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with films, as with so many foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and turns it into a profoundly sincere lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the routine of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out a window at a dance studio. The moment he takes his train to pass, he is delighted with it. But is it only because of its beauty, its distant gaze, or a connection that both will find they share? <br /> <br /> We Must Dance has wonderful memorable characters who have to deal with painful realities, transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking the traditional molds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk everything for happiness and think that joy is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane, showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.
