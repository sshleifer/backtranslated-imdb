A typical joke of Cheech and Chong's reality, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !! It's not as consistent or plausible as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly funny, without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get gas for the car and the car for work. Also funny is Cheech's music (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's accompanying music. Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (Human Noise Machine) from the Police Academy series, and the old man laughing. All in all, this is a great accompaniment to Up in Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
