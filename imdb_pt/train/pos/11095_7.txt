I always liked this film by John Frankenheimer. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why this was not just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to small details make all the difference, he even hired porn actress Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can argue that it was Roy Scheider's last good movie. I always said that Robert Trebor gave a great performance. Clarence Williams III won all the publicity with his scary performance and he is also excellent, but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as the others, but it is an effective thriller, full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real pornographic actors that appear in despicable parts. What can you say about a movie where Ann Margaret was hit by drugs and raped? Guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a lousy role and a young Kelly Preston appears early. A classic suspense explorer that should not be missed.
