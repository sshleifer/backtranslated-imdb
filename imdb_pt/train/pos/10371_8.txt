This is a story film based on an extremely powerful story that can be infuriating to watch. I say this because the press can be brutal and ferocious to people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this movie came out. but I thought Sam Neill was as good. Let's just say they were both excellent, but the role was a little more difficult for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned so well that I had difficulty understanding her in parts.) <br /> <br /> Without saying anything, all I can say is that this movie will wear you out emotionally.
