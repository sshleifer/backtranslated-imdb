Firstly, this is really my favorite movie ever. I do not need to give anyone a description because every hole does that. I'm literally obsessed with these lame, blood-less, tasteless effects with boom-stick, poorly edited, horror work of the '80s. The director (I heard) was expecting box-office success for be able to make sequences and have a kind of FREDDY / JASON arrangement for yourself. Damn, I wish it could have been that way! The soundtrack is beating. The acting is good .... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and any diehard fan out there, feel free to email and chat at some point. Midgetorgy .... I can be found on YAHOO.
