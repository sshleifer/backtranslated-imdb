I saw this movie a few months ago on the cable, and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was incredible. He makes you care about your character, even when he's clearly doing the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell does a performance that is arguably the best performance I've seen for an actress this year. She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is simply scary as Macy's father, and John Ritter is very much like a psychiatrist stuck in the middle of everything that is happening. I would like this to happen in theater because I feel it is a movie that should be seen by a wider audience. It's a pity, because it's so much better than most new films are in the movies right now. <br /> <br />
