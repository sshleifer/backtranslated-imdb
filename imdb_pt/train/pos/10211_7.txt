Narratives if written, epic visual or poetic ?? generally try to avoid can also characters; readers and viewers, after all, can easily be overcome by trying to track who exactly is who. This is especially true in the movies, I think, simply because we can not easily return to refresh our memory in a movie theater. Viewers like myself, however, do not have this problem because we watch all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004) both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters. This previous offer exceeds the others in both directions: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now other directors have used these techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that, first, the director allows us to "see" inside the head of some of the characters and, second, some scenes are repeated as means of refreshing the memory of the spectator as the story blends between different periods of time . /> <br /> The basics ?? the core, so to speak? story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou), who is told by a fellow train on a train that she will find her true love that day. This occurs in the first few minutes of the movie. The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the opposite young man (Gilbert Robin) can be that "a true love." And neither does he ... <br /> <br /> They go their separate ways without realizing the potential significance of their intimate encounter. However, chaos results during the rest of the day, not only for the two youngsters, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of cleverly constructed and intertwined vignettes that seem to be going nowhere, and yet ... <br /> <br /> If history were just that, it could tend to be boring and even quite predictable. Not so. The script and the director translate our expectations with a series of innovative scenes that are very common but are transformed into extraordinary and reliable events that allow the two potential lovers to meet again. For example, the next time a birdcap of the sky falls on a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of fate meet again. Or how about a stone chip flying on your windshield? Consider again what would happen ... <br /> <br /> All this is interesting enough. What was most interesting for me was to evaluate every new man who came along and try to decide if this guy was the only one for Irene, or if he was, in fact, the young man on the train. It made me guess for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about it if you see this delightful joke. <br /> <br /> Recommended for all.
