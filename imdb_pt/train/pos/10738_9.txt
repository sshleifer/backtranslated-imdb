SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC.2 French filmmakers in New York filming the actions of a NYFD are being confronted with this event and making the most of it. / 11 Nothing really happens which gives the film an even more horrific scenario. On the day of the attacks it seems just another boring day at work, but that will soon change. As one of the movie makers goes down the road with the firemen he shoots the first plane crashing, this is the only footage from the first impact. He travels with the fire department to the WTC and enters the building. When the second plane crashes, people understand that this is not an accident. In the next period of time, we see firefighters making plans to save as many people as possible. Meanwhile we hear beating sounds, these are the sounds of people who jumped from the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most tiring moment of the documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life, you hear him breathe like crazy while he runs out of the building. Then a huge type of sandstorm explodes on him and the screen turns black, he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown New York. Because this documentary has so many historical footage and because the film was meant to be something totally different, this documentary will probably be in everyone's memory. I have seen the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon, so this makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10
