When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was that this movie was more of an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing amazing acrobatics. The stunts are very similar to the Matrix moves, such as the movement too fast for the type of bullets and the jump around too far. Another reason why I the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces that they make during the movie. The way Gackt makes his grimaces or just how they act, MUCH ANIME. I think it's a great movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde are also 10). ^ _ ~ If you are a fan of Gackt and Hyde, you have to see.
