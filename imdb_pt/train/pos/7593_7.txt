The movie is absolutely silly. <br /> <br /> But were you expecting a high-level intellectual movie based on a comic book called Slam Dunk? Same? Jay Chou's acting is not exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the incredible level that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Was it completely fun if you're just taking the value of the surface? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese idols and musicians who can play basketball on an unrealistic level of expertise. There's an evil Triad-style guy and a nutcase that involves Jay Chou in all of this. A love interest. It is stereotyped, but really, suspend disbelief for a while. Let's go. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you have signed? Do yourself a favor if you watch - I found a copy with a few Engrish captions that made the movie an unintelligible conversation, but we managed to have a great laugh. They seem to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I threw. I watch again. <br /> <br /> Especially for that fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well filmed. I especially like the pool table lit with plexiglass - I would love to touch one of those. <br /> <br /> Slippery enough for me, but I create in the trash of the movies.
