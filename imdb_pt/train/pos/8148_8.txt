I have zero interest rap and ghetto culture, I'm white and like classic rock, however, this did not stop me from enjoying this fantastic comedy. It's practically a sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap or rock. It's still hilarious. There are many funny jokes, but not without some jokes that end up falling. The characters are all very funny and believable. I watched it just because it made me laugh at 3 in the morning, and any movie that can do that deserves at least one test view. One of the reasons this movie was so funny was that it made fun of rap from a different one. Rap today is worried about the wrong things and gets along with the studio noise and with little talent. This movie comes from a time when rappers deserved more credit. Overall, it's a funny movie with lots of jokes about racism, sex, and musical culture among the most obvious humor themes. This is highly recommended for any fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same film, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work on both films.
