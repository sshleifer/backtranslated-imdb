As this film is completely in Swiss dialect, it is probably difficult for most German speakers to actually follow this film. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years, so I had the chance to understand this great parody of The Lord of the Rings. I've seen many such films (eg Scary Movie, many science fiction spoofs, etc.) but this is the best of its kind, I've seen it so far. I give a 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give a 10 is because there are some small details that could have been made better and because they have not provided subtitles in any language on the DVD so there is almost no chance not to -I know to understand.
