This is a delightful movie that is so exaggerated that my wife, my daughter and I find it irresistible. The plot is just crazy, but "sounds true" to the world of novels in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performances of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I'm not better than Kline in playing THICKheaded. The desperate need for attention and affirmation of Field's character - and his almost bipolar mood swings - played well against the background of the infamous (infamous?) De Field "You Like Me!" Exclamation Oscar. People who can take themselves with such a big grain of salt are rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only movie that I did not find impatient with Whoopi Goldberg's characterization; I thought she was "on the spot" on every note she reached. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate. Just a great movie, if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and RIA!
