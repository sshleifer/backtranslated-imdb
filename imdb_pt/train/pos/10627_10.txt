So what constitutes a real independent film? In a day and age when the latest fad in traditional Hollywood is rude and cutting edge, I'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually no more than a clever marketing move. <BR> <BR> That's why we should rejoice in movies like "Hate of a Minute". On the whole, this film makes a point of contradicting its own model (indie horror film). Love or hate, "Hate" is not afraid to be what it is, and by watching this movie, you get the real sense that Kallio (the director) did not make this movie just to spread fake blood all over the world. In fact, he's here to tell stories. Good. You can find this movie in the horror movies section of your store, but do not be fooled, this story is also about love, about good people pushed to the limit, and that light so far at the end of the movie. tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect smut, or an Evil Dead ripoff, stay away from this movie. But if you discover the finer points of horror / suspense genres, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this movie, and I'm sure he's proud to tell someone it's not "Evil Dead." Bruce never tried to bet on his "gray" image, and it's obvious he did not get involved with "Hate" so he could do it. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, for all Dead-ites devouring furiously anything emitted by Mr. Campbell is to check out this movie anyway and see what else Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> The acting is well done, although nothing about this movie is Oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it is good to see compassionate performances in a horror movie. So often, actors in films like these do not even seem to try, with "Hate", it seemed that all actors took their scores very seriously, never resorting to a typical horror movie atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hatred" is as competent as the indie movie. The editing is fast, the cinematography is good, given the budget, and the "Hate" keeps a fast pace, without any blinking or bad anti-climax. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hate can not I have the undercover look of all those fake million dollar indies, but personally, I do not see a problem with that. It's a movie of people who really care about the medium. The people who got into their pockets tore their pockets, took their nickles and dimes, threw caution into the wind and made a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this.
