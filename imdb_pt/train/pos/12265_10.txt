"Tintin and I" at first seemed to me a masterpiece documentary. The photography and editing are really breathtaking (almost anti-Dogma). <br /> <br /> We followed the life of Tintin Hergé's drawer through an open interview of 1971. The Tintin series was drawn in the background. of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the middle of these, Hergé has his own demons to fight, and much of his drawing activity seems an attempt to tame them and flee to a world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Although there are spectacular panoramic photographs of drawings from Tintin's albums and also some reconstructions and passage readings of the albums, Hergé's story is told entirely through interviews and archival material, and never through reconstructions . <br /> <br /> Hergé lived the turbulent life of a true and suffering artist. But the fantastic world that came from your imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
