I saw this movie for the first time ten years ago and I thought it was very funny. It was not as bad as some critics were doing. The fact that it was written by the generally trustworthy John Hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think Weird Science is very good and it was also written at the speed of light by Hughes). The film has a very gaudy appearance using all the primary colors - reds, yellows etc - which makes it look quite original. The cast is also very good. The pudgy Bunny Packard and the one possessed by the demon Delores Salk are a highlight. <br /> <br /> The film certainly dated a little, but I personally prefer all the other 'Lampoon' series.
