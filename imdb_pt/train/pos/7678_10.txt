I just watched Holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called Trade at the Film by the Sea International Film Festival. I have to say that Holly blew Trade from the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematic perspective, it's incredible. Sound mixing, camera angles, direction and performance are clearly visible. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way it handles the subject is tasteful and non-exploitative. It presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate. Filmmakers paid special attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the child sexual exploitation and trafficking epidemic. Often, in dealing with such a subject, it is tempting to shock the public with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into this typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen the most moved public. Just by listening to conversations after the screening, people are asking what they can do personally to combat child sexual exploitation. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend everyone, both for their cinematographic value and for their subject.
