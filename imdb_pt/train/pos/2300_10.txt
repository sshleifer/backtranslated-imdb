This movie has so many wonderful elements to it! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is of course wonderful, but so is his chemistry with Jason London. The punctuation is remarkable, joyful and pure. James Newton Howard increases the quality of any film he composes ten times. He also seems to have a knack for the lost days films of the youth, do not forget to pick up your score for the recent "Peter Pan" and the astonishing gothic music of "The Village". I first saw this movie at about 13 or 14 and now I do not cry just in the end, I shed a tear or two through nostalgia. Show this movie for your daughters. It will eventually become a life-long comfort film.
