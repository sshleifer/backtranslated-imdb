Although I liked more of On the Town, I really enjoyed it. I'm a newbie when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I had heard of them, I had never seen anything with them until recently. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene. I think it's better too. But I thought this movie was good and like all movies, there are some parts better than others, but in my book it's a great movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I still have to see them together in Take me to the ball game. But I'm sticking to my guns saying I really liked it, and I love it!
