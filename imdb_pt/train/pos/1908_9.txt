This show is beautifully done. When I first went out, I thought it was nothing more than a cheerful family comedy with a few good catch phrases. It seemed to express many families very well too, with different concepts of father and son, however, as I said, I never thought of it more than a good vigil in one night. However, my vision was taken from the other window when the tragic death of the incredibly funny John Ritter piled up. The program remained firm and truly praised the lives of the characters in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all admirers of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with talent for doing anything. When the show aired after Ritters' passing, I really just wanted to give a hug to my dad and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought this shined threw the acting talents of the three children, particularly the character of Bridget, who was worried about the last words she told him. It reminded me that no matter what horrible things I tell my father, I'm not serious and it's very important that he knows that. Great show
