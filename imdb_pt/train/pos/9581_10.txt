This film documents the Harlem ball circuit in the mid-eighties. Much more entertaining than the Palazzo Volpi, though so ill, this movie is a true jewel of misery. One can not help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness. The only purpose of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of garbage and brightness. Here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and properly glamourized. The propensity of the characters to the idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires still more the adoration of the own personages on the part of the spectator, creating a effect of phenomenon of phenomenon that makes this film a work of art.
