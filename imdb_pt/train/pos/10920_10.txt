I remember seeing this movie as a kid. I do not remember where I saw it. I must be about 14 years old. I found the movie incredible and wished to see it again. It came on the Kung Fu channel once, but I missed it. I was really upset. It's the best Kung Fu special effects movie I've seen so far! I recommend it, and now that I've figured out where to get it, I can enjoy it again and for years to come. I also have to check out this Return of Poison movie, which some have been talking about so well.
