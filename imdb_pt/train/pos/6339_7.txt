The Grinch part was made for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with his performance. Not being a big fan of him I was apprehensive but pleasantly surprised at the outcome. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou That was the cutest girl I've seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I was even with tears at one point! I never read the book of Dr. Seuss's tale, so I did not know what to expect, the mood was rather bleak. Overall, I enjoyed the movie (besides the songs!) And recommend it especially for the family viewing.
