This is a beautiful, rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful history. Basically, he tells how an old storyteller needs to find an heir (male) to continue his craft, but ends up not getting what he expected in his world dominated by men. The characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must deal with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his traditional notions of society. <br /> <br /> History is fun, emotional and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives and emotions is rich and convincing, the character development is strong, while the characters are complex and are not one-dimensional. The film cleverly conveys the emotions of the old man and his desire to find an heir, and convincingly shows how he and the child deal with the situation. There is also humor, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points. The film also examines what is good and what is bad in traditional Chinese culture, creating more interest and depth in the film. <br /> <br /> The direction, the performance and the scenery are excellent. Added to other strengths, this creates rich, compelling visual images and real, engaging characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy and feelings about the characters. <br /> <br /> Some have stated that the ending weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall movie would have been quite small.
