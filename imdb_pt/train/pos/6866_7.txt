************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie and it was because I got a huge slump by Richard Belzer. I do not know much about humor) There was a part that was funny Like Barbie and Ken Spoof and the dealers and the president forget. Pay attention that this is sometimes cheeky (Dare, I say raw?) It was sometimes funny, but could have been better. Probably, if they spent more time in humor and less time getting women out of nudity, the movie would have been funnier. Some skits just make you want to gag and shrink, other skits make you laugh and strangely think. Unfortunately this movie is dated. If you have a crazy passion for Richard Belzer (Worth it), it's worth checking out and seeing the Chevy Chase.
