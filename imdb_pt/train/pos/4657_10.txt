Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A fun and unusual story with wonderful performances from four of the best professionals who have ever worked in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant as usual, and Maggie Smith - definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time - is a total delight. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and are also perfect. If you want a movie that has a perfect cast, that's it. What is so impressive is how these people work with each other naturally and effortlessly, creating lots of laughs and fun times everywhere. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also top-notch, and it's a great time capsule from London in the 60's. It's definitely on my all-time favorite list.
