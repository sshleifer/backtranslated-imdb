After many years of waiting, Anne Rivers's famous book Siddons, "The House Next Door," was finally filmed. The result deviates somewhat from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy, is understandable if unsatisfactory, since it is a TV movie, the whole is absorbing and really very good, not as large as the book, one by Stephen King's favorites and one of mine too. With more runtime and fewer restrictions as a theatrical version, all the wealth inherent in the original three-part story of the sinister ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially climatic revelation near the end. <br /> <br /> Still, the whole cast fits well into this thoughtful tale of foolish malevolence. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house of an amateur neighbor of amateur artist who is trying to visualize his corruption on the screen. Be sure to read the great novel.
