The Wooden Horse is a very clever film about a very clever and successful escape plan developed by British prisoners during World War II. It is superbly interpreted with an ironic sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by acid-languages ​​Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The steering is steady and fast. Highly recommended.
