good movie, good music, good experience and an acceptable plot. but the main point, as his films tend to be, man is the best actor of idea and can turn dust into gold. nana patekar this may be his second best performance after parinda (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. a man who will never disappoint him. <br /> <br /> Good movie, although I think shahrukh was a luxury that this movie could have done without. you can see in your movies, others strive hard to reach your heights and act from your skins. but this man is really something elase. <br /> <br /> the movie is cool, the music and direction is excellent plot a bit slim but the screen play and dialog again very good. one should watch.
