In the early 1970s, many of us who wholeheartedly embraced hippie / acid / alternative culture realized that the dominant society would not change the way we thought. For me, this movie defined the tension of "now what?" that many of the people I knew felt at that time. Do we go to the commune and create our own vision of utopia or radicalize and push for change? From futile police gestures, to radical rhetoric, to Pink Floyd's music, to love and explosive images in the desert - there's a lot inside. It captures a significant moment in time.
