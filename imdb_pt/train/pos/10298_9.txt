I was at least happy to see Jim Carrey in a movie in which being overdone was not the goal. Your character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things happened to us and hoping that God would deliver us. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us, still ready to take a vacation when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br /> I thought the character of Jennifer Aniston was a bit vulnerable and sympathetic towards Carry the TV anchor, basically egocentric, wants to be, but this is how it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes, because everyone who saw them knew what was to come before it happened. I read a lot of comments and it seems like some people are looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and does not intend to solve the world's problems, although there are some messages that we could all take seriously. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
