I really like the original, and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Oops: Most of the original voice cast returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like the voice of Timon's mother. I know she made a voice in The Simpsons, but this show is just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We started seeing Simba as a "teenager." <br /> <br /> Downs: They squandered this with a slugging contest between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon about "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumba figure that out? <br /> <br /> Music again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music). <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. (also Timon's soil). <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very good movie. I recommend it to fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, you probably do not like this one. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
