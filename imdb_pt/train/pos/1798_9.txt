I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it's a stick-to-your-bones movie - it's really stayed with me. Adapted very cleverly from what is probably an excellent novel, it's a backstage drama with fully rounded characters, reflection on life choices and, I'm not exaggerating. one of the biggest filmmakers ever assembled in more than 100 years of film production. A wonderful work of all, led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a delirious and delirious matron of Newport, and Claire Danes as her youngest. Meryl Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, is like Mommy's real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not exaggerate the charm; and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing detailed and detailed appearances. Hugh Dancy, also on stage, does not attach much importance to the rather clich√©d role of a poor wretch, and family problems are perhaps solved more accurately than real life would allow. But it is a visually stimulating meditation on real life problems, and you may cry and not feel that you are being handled recklessly. Also, what a sumptuous stop of the 1940s / 50s.
