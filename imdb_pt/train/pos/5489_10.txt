Very good point there: "only a few elite (the upper classes) would have both access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively English speaking site like IMDb" Some may think Internet is not reality, but this point of view really put media society and democracy at risk: you're probably right ... Even if there's an Internet caf√© in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters will not even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Screw you faschist high class rich capitalist liberal intellectual intellectual suppressants .. Probably this is your first time using Internet;) ..
