Why this movie disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie best. The brutal violence, the cool designs of the characters and the good rhythm make this one of the best fantasies around. It's certainly the biggest animated film for a more grown-up audience I've ever seen. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It's a big difference for Bakshi and, in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves.
