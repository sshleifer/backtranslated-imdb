The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story to accompany the Lion King. Basically follows the original story of The Lion King, but with some twists and turns. In the movie, the breaths are explained by a different character view. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> As for the sequels, Disney is not so good at making it worth it. This, being the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second), actually has an original idea while still involving the fun of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel in search of the ideal place to live. After looking far, find the place of "Hakuna Matata". They then find a little lion named Simba, and go through many things that parents spend today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very good movie, and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
