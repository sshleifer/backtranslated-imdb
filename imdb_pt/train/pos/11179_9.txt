"Pet Sematary" succeeds in two main situations. First, it's a scary horror movie. Those that simply are not produced these days. Secondly, it is an emotional and intelligent film in general. So if you're looking for chills, fuss, creepy and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs and horrible effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and truly a must-see for any Horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably the best fit for any of King's novels. The events seem a bit rushed compared to the novel, but that does not mean that this underrated film is not a complete Horror / Drama achievement. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known to be very emotional and awful at the same time. The film captures the same feeling mainly because there is a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between your members. So when everything seems to be bliss (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not look flippant!) A tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, now it gets very dark. The film has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, scary. Dealing with the loss of a baby is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and "Pet Sematary" proves this dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind the pet semester is more than a myth no one wants to experience, but sadness and despair lead an emotionally destroyed parent to shoot him. Unfortunately, the legend comes true and the baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet semi legend turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it's something much, much worse. What happened to the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow avoid this tragedy? What about the surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch "Pet Sematary" to watch one of the most moving and emotional horror films of recent times. You will not regret. The acting is very good, although I have not dug the actor who played the father. He did not seem disturbed enough when situations called for his despair. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby really did a great job and worked perfect as the noble and tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing, even in its scary parts. * Shivers * Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches the deepest fears of people ... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life and a feeling of despair. <br /> <br /> Something is for sure ... I do not want to be buried in a pet sitter !!
