*** 1/2 Out of the ***** While I am not worried about the fact that this is an English dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to reside in many native hearts Quebecois. However, this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of; bearing in mind now that it was made for children, I rate it on a relative basis. The story is of children on winter vacation building an incredible strong snow, and jerks back-'in-com for the control of guns, such as snowballs and other blends such as idle hands and lessons of equal winter break time free. If I had kids, that's definitely a movie I'd try to get them interested in, since the snowplow impressed me when I was young, and I think even today's kids would agree, though with Pixar and all the excitement by computer, maybe I'm out of date and just do not realize it. In addition, the message of the film is wonderfully allegorical and a positive in that, for children (and adults).
