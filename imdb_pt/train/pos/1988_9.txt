First, I would like to make a correction in another review of this film that said that the last musical to win the Oscar for Best Picture was' Gigi 'in 1958. This is misinformation as' West Side Story' won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady 'won in 1965 and' Sound of Music 'won the year after that. That said, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel was somewhat altered but this is more because of the limitations they had on a stage that they simply did not change back to a filmed version. However, I do not care. In fact, I think the whole production flows better than the novel. I like Nancy by bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start hanging out at the beginning of the governor's office. The underline for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this movie were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is worked out much better than he is in the book), and Shani Wallis, which is the strongest and most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two large production numbers that are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy'. I always hate when choreography in musicals meant looking like people doing daily chores and jobs. It looks awful and extravagant, especially when they are dancing at the London Meat Co. They should have done regular choreographies for these scenes. However, this movie is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.
