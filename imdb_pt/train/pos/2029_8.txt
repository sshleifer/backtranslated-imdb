As a horse lover, you can only enjoy this movie. There are some movies that show riding like this does. I'd love to know if Brian does his own ride in the movie. I also wonder if he likes horses. Brian has been in many movies where he has ridden. Where did he learn to walk? The only part that is difficult for me is that the riding scenes are always complete, as a horse can run forever at full throttle. The camera work is top notch and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they released this movie to find all the good knights.
