The GI is not as bad as many have achieved. I thought the film had a bit of humor and sacrificial cynicism, as in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and superior action is deliberate and contributes to the comic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A special trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space-age war campaigns tattooed. d on his chest and one of those battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For outsiders out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the last elegiac lines of Roy Batty in Blade Runner. Imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops as Roy is incomprehensible to say the least. Maybe screenwriter David Peoples misses? <br /> <br /> I'll give this one a 3 out of 5.
