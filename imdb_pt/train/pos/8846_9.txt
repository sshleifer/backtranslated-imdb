I really enjoyed this Sidney Lumet drama. The best word I can describe is insane. It throws the viewer around in an hour and fifty minutes and does not let you breathe until the credits start rolling in the end. Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing the whole way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story. The acting is incredible from all the leads and even the small, excellent cast parts. I also loved cinematography, it gave him the real feel as if it were an independent movie. Everything was great. <br /> <br /> This film is lively, exhausting and moving. It's almost hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did.
