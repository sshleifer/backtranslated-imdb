I've seen this movie twice or more and found it well done! World War II had just ended and the so-called "Cold War" was about to begin. This film could therefore be defined as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic films preparing Americans and, secondly, people from the "NATO Western bloc" formed by countries to face the next threat coming. The film celebrates the power of the United States, over the centuries, as it sets out for the then-present, just-finished war. Good and funny is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and beautiful New York "spy" and the Manhattan purchase of a drunken local Indian .. Must see it (at least once, out of fashion curiosity of propaganda through time)! :)
