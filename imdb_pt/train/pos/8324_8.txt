This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker for his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay between these major roles is enhanced by a fantastic supporting cast of well-recognized character actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a "feel good!" Warmest recommendations.
