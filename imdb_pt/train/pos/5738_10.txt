I just bought and saw the DVD of this movie. The DVD download is from last year, 2001. This 1988 film is really a great movie. Neglected by most people. I saw him at the theater in 1988 and I've loved it ever since. I love the opening shot of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another reviewer commented). It makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And should I say, Pitts's tour in the dump truck with Nicky is very scenic, interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else has said, gives a remarkable and wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer, with no extras, but a widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
