On rare occasions comes a movie that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is such a movie. I have "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the movie business. She attended the second time with me. We were both fascinated. It's like it's the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment when all your dramas began to happen. He does this while relentlessly amused. Bret Carr's acting and rhythm as a director does not allow you to look away from the screen. He makes a character that disarms with a pet rabbit, stuttering innocence, but lovingly loaded with a sincerity so underrated that you forget that you are watching a movie. When the epiphany hits during the bright climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. As a life coach, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant and creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
