This is one of the few movies that are very erotic without being pornographic, although there is only a very rudimentary plot. There is not much live sound or dialogue; instead, actors make voices describing their experience, why they participated, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's a document. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. <br /> <br /> I can totally understand why no one else tried to do something like that. There is already something like this. This one. :-) <br /> <br /> NB: The producer has no right to distribute a DVD version. I also never saw it sold anywhere; you can send an email to Mr. Boerner and request a copy on VHS.
