Since I was just a kid when this show aired recently I recently got the DVD and I'm wishing there were more episodes filmed. This show was a 90's version of the TV series pop-90 "X-Files" - but with a bit more of a comic / light hearted approach. But do not get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which have some very daring scenarios (left to the imagination, of course - this was 70's television). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots where a little silly as well as acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series. Whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies or science fiction / horror themes, this series has put all that together. Each episode lasted about 50 minutes (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes passed quickly always leaving me wanting more. A great classic show that is underestimated in my book!
