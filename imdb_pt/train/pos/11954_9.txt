Great movie, enough laughs and action for any audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who posted in this movie took on the responsibility of calling Woody Allen incestuous and not commenting on the movie, here I am. The film follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, who follow a hint given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their quest leads them to the killer's house and eventually to a rather tragic end. But do not let the plot fool you, the film is truly hilarious and the acting is superb. <br /> <br /> It seems that when directors reach a certain age, they really get things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to do some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers. In addition, by watching the movie in a pact theater, you can simply say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to actually make a comeback. The second he walked in the audience brightened. There's just something about the man and he really shines on Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
