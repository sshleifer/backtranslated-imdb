I loved this movie I thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget. I ran out after seeing this to buy the DVD, obv not easily forgotten! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, and the cast could not be more perfect. Each character has its moment, and I laughed a lot over this movie, the comic timing was perfect. <br /> <br />
