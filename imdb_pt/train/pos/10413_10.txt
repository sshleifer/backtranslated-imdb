I grew up with it as my all time favorite movie. The special effects are incredible for the time and were awarded. I remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It is simply a great timeless adventure. The song is by Miklos Rosza, who is the best in film history. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big villain. I have a copy in hand, for the next trip down memory lane. Whoa ai! Rex Ingram wants to get out of his genii bottle!
