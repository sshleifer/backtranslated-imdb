EXCAVATION! It's funny, fun, fun, interesting, elegant and very well done. Knowing that it was done with such a tight budget over 7 years, it is surprising that such a story can be told, especially with such style and substance. If you are a fan of music or a fan of documentary, this is a must see. Focusing on the Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who knows with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to commit and a great megalomaniac vocalist supported by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and insanity. If I did not know this was filming real people, I would swear it was an incredibly well-written and imaginative scripted piece. The story is compelling, concise, and simply incredible.
