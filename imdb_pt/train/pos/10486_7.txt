"Saving Grace" is never very funny, but it gives a good laugh and I liked it a lot. Brenda Blethyn is a great actress, and does a good job portraying Grace's widow, who uses marijuana to pay off her huge debt. The support cast also does a good job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The premise alone is attractive. The idea of ​​a growing and smoking woman seems fun enough. And the movie plays with the premise wisely from time to time. Of course, there are flat times, like one in which two elderly women confuse Grace's marijuana leaves with tea leaves and begin to play childishly in the shop where they work. This was a meaningless joke that did not take off. The tone of the film is disheartening and occasionally monotonous, but I have enough laughter to give a recommendation to the Englishman. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
