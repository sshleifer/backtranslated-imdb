"Thieves and liars" presents a rather naturalistic description of the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and forces them to make difficult, if not impossible, choices about the lives of their loved ones. The cast is excellent, considering that some are non-professional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality of the film. Photography boosts the story without intrusion, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the "Boricuas" in a very deep way. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! Watching this movie, you feel as if you have secretly entered into real Puerto Rican society and remain invisible watching it implode. I loved!
