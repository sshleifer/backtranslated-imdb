Will you all please leave the Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you do! The guy has 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free! Of course the acting is laughable at times. Yes, the makeup is not the best you will see. But also not the worst, if you want to see this, go watch Zombie Nation with your raccoon zombies. <br /> <br /> This is pure, good old guerilla film! Todd is a consummate professional and a nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems forced. What the hell, do I still love this movie? I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and make the remake of it as he was going. If someone has tried to make a movie, they know that just finishing it is an achievement in itself.
