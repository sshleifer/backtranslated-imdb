I first saw this as a child living in East London. The scars of the Hitler Luftwaffe were very evident and the landscape of the film resembled our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing this. The curious thing is that, in fact, it was not dated, if seen as a piece of social history in film fiction. <br /> <br /> In addition to a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was very wrong, more nanotechnology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived at that time. I would have thought firing a spacecraft from a gigantic weapon would almost certainly kill the astronauts. However, a lot was right. Mans desire for war, the inhumanity of man to man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
