This is my first CG animated film I've ever seen. Usually the appearance of other animated films made me reluctant to see them. It was not ice. I wanted to see him the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious squirrel toothtooth. <br /> <br /> The Ice Age was sporadically fun and fun to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years ago. The visuals were great. Simply gorgeous. It's one thing to create compelling information, another entirely different thing is to create visually interesting things and the Ice Age is great to see with your stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company that should look for in the future.
