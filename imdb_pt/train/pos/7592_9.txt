I just watched the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, to clarify things, this film pretends to be nothing but a solid action. comedy movie. The goal is not to revolutionize the film industry and get critical acclaim, or want to be considered as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie to its fullest, I suggest you discard your critical ability and your longing for a good plot, because you will not find any here. With that settled, let's delve into the movie. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations for this movie simply because it did not have a strong storyline (yes, viewers, I underestimated this movie too), but I've never waited so long to enjoy this movie. I even liked it more than the Stephen Chow movies (which I think Kung Fu Hustle is your best effort and would have rated it a 9 as well). The action is tight and epic, while comedy chokes in the right places. <br /> <br /> Alert SPOILERS, I think the action may be unreal, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie? There are many other sports (drama) films that have done well, why create another? SPOILERS end <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and watch. Remember, do not think - just watch, have fun, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> From time to time they (the film industry) create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, and sometimes create movies that are better on the trash pile. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have, then again, if we're talking about Stephen Chow-ish's comedy, this is a top ten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you love: -shoes of brainer films with very good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -What the hell, watch this. you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you the cast of Kung Fu Dunk.
