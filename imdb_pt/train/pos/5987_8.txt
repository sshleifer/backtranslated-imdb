Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves retirement school and returns to the favelas. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does his best to keep him out of trouble, but seems to follow him. In addition to his associations with the termite gang, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to receive insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and Gabe is that. It is up to the termites to work the law in their favor and give the bad guys their fair desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that features Dead End Kids is really very good. The boys wander to the new resident's furniture on the street and start doing it. They talk to each other in elegant accents and talk about tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap on a chair. The boys then begin to quarrel with the new kid, but after he turns out to be a good fighter, they ask him to join the club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is very good too, full of mischief that seems dangerous at first, but is actually quite intelligent and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. This is beautifully staged, with little holograms of children walking on his face and throwing questions at him. <br /> <br /> Angels Wash Their Faces is a great title because it plays with Angels with Dirty Faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these guys are cool in this movie. But instead of looking fake, it makes big laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in The Bowery Boys series. We even received some distorted words from Leo Gorcey.
