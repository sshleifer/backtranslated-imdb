Before movies like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Suspiria' and 'Halloween' changed the vision of horror forever, there was a more Gothic and much less violent era in the genre. Films like the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences during the '60s and early' 70s. I can not tell you how many times I rented this movie during my childhood, but I did because there were Something about it. I did not want to limit myself to the horror movies and zombies of the '70s and' 80s, and films like this one from the famous but sadly long film company Amicus were off to a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: A great and strange soundtrack. Strong performances by a stellar cast. Bright cinematography. Very good old fashioned emotions and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes. Some amazing moments and images. It moves at a slow but steady pace. The house is a scary and oppressive dwelling. Great production design and stage decor, which give the film a true sense of gothic horror. It depends more on humor and shivers without blood than nullity and free nudity for your emotions. <br /> <br /> Cons: Some issues of rhythm in the first half. In addition to 'The Cloak', the rest of the stories seem to have been made before. Clich√©s in abundance. The second story, 'Waxworks', has good acting and is moments, but it is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense. The low budget really shows sometimes. Final Thoughts: After seeing this movie for the first time in many years, I can see why I rented it so often. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Watch this with the lights off. My rating: 3.5 / 5
