The film reaches the bowels of the tension between a son and a father. <br /> <br /> Brilliant dialogue, enchanting scenery and great acting serve as a great way to present the onion that continues to peel layers. <BR> <BR> The central issues of parenting, communication and masculinity are explored indirectly. <br /> <br /> In fun shapes the curtain is pulled back, the masks slip a little and the truths are exposed. <br /> <br /> All this happens in the middle of a travel format. The backdrop is the rural state of New York in the early fall, just as the trees are changing color. WOW!
