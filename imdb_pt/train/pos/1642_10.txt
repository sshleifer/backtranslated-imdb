I have not seen the movie since the first release, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were superb, great photography, heartwarming history and everything else was of a high standard. However, it seems to have been virtually forgotten <br /> <br /> Maybe because the UK is a strange market for this, but I have not seen the film on TV or in the video, which is sad. Was it more successful in the US, where it can be seen as a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always consider that 50% of a good movie is music, and although I'm not sure, I think the theme of the title was a simple yet moving, clarinet solo of "What friend we have in Jesus". The movie then went on to disprove this! Am I right or wrong?
