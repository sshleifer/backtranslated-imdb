The radiant magnetism of Elvira, attracting her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her long, well-tuned figure, big bust, naively malicious attitude and lexicon of "valley slang," Elvira's character has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of the narrative, it is evident that Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of his sharp verses and big chest. Started from the way the city's children react to it, it represents the deep teenage fantasy of an experienced woman who can connect to them at her level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boy sexual desire, and desire for fun non-threateningly unconcerned. It symbolizes an underdeveloped ideal of femininity perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the city. The other adults have problems with it for the same reasons. In the end, however, your movie can not pass its most exaggerated ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak it is a showcase for her talents. Almost everything is adapted to a teenage mentality and although it is a simple comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to appreciate the absurd. Fortunately, I have this ability and found the film to be a charming delight. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I had no complaints.
