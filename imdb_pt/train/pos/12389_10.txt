Bored with the normal and ordinary movies to watch this Halloween I've seen over and over again, I had a shot at "The Sentinel," hoping it could make my horror juices flow again. Remember, I had just come back from seeing the remake of The Castle on Dark Haunted Hill - a complete and utter crap. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" surprised me! In a fascinating story about a model who moves to a scary building in Brooklyn Hights, the film offers everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campy and fantastically succulent characters, exchanges and dialogues, including hilarious turns of Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam as a distracted teacher - (2) Horrifying Horror! Not to give a frame away, but there are scenes in this movie that chilled me to my pancreas - (3) Fantastic gore, fantastic makeup and crazy direction (if very uneven) by Michael Winner, which flows very well with this unreal treat. If you love "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this movie - after I first watched it, my jaw dropped, I came back and watched again. You are now a favorite of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
