My Tutor Friend is a well-scripted romance comedy movie that has something like My Sassy Girl .. there are no sex / kissing scenes. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always necessary in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is slightly heartfelt, with occasional CG cartoon scenes mixed with the film. I like the part where Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he traded Su-Wan for another girl and soon became a father. As he became father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao Points: 8/10
