Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock are trapped in the Ice Age of the planet while Captain Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, it is the first pair that has more time trying. In addition to the icy temperatures and the sanctuary to be found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this age, he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction for Zarabeth and playing "caution in the wind" about leaving this place. Only with Dr. McCoy's constant "reminders" does Spock maintain a certain understanding of reality. <br /> <br /> This position is one of the few times in which the character manages to show some "emotion" and Nimoy (Spock). plays to the finish, coming close to knocking down Deforest Kelly's bejesus (McCoy). Surprisingly, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to receive the girl, another advantage for him. <br /> <br /> Ian Wolfe perennial plays the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio to the past.
