Chuck Jones's "Hare Conditioned" is a quick and often hilarious drawing. Chopping Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to have it stuffed, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setup. The chase takes Bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gag that they quickly emerge from various departments using any clothing that is associated with that part of the store. This great gag is surpassed, however, by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugsy, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager into ruthlessly entering or exiting the elevators at the wrong time. It's a brilliant piece at the climax that, unfortunately, gives way to a not-so-funny final joke. At that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' made its mark as one of the great chase movies, replete with wild energy. As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons of that period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that he could still be as attractive as a more anarchic character.
