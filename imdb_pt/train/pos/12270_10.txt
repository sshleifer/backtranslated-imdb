I've been looking for this movie for years, apparently not available here in the United States, so bought me a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture out into the woods looking for a bear. who apparently killed several campers. What they discover is a former Vietnam veteran gone mad (he kills some of his victims wearing a glove with long metal fingernails to Freddy Krueger). As night falls, one of the girls goes out for a walk after a brief discussion with her boyfriend, she is dead. After one of the groups finds his body, everyone hides in their tents waiting for the light of day. Once the sun rises, they all try to survive, but they are victims one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not much gore, but a couple of good murders, especially the boys. deaths. The guys are killed somehow without blood (blown up in the car, shot dead, stabbed in the head). <br /> <br /> Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a good horror movie from the late 80's. Nothing new, just pretty hectic, fast and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.
