When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it would not be a mindbender movie. Instead, I thought of it as a disbelief of reality in which someone is going to suffer a serious beating. And you know what worked. Kurt Russel did what I thought was a remarkable role in showing the unemotional soldier he was. I recommend this movie if you go out with the boys and want to watch a good action movie.
