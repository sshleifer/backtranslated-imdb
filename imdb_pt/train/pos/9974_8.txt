Of course this was a remake of a 1970s movie, but it had the suspense and action of a current movie, says Breakdown. He is running, desperate to be with his wife hospitalized, the police are the least concern. The chases were very good, the part where he was cornered on a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great suspense. This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed wrong? The character of Vigo knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law, few movies had the effects - night vision, CB radio - okay I forgot the name of the movie, man has 76'Caddy poisoned, face toys he annoyed . The ending is great, you can not tell whether or not he fakes his suicide, a good do-it-or-no.
