I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not as lewd as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) with the Slovenian philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, of the multi-talented Fiennes clan (she is the sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I really liked that, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD. , since there is a stew of ideas to be digested. The Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be very heavy and seeing the whole series at once became a little disorienting at the end of two and a half hours. It did not help that an ill-informed coffee and the possession of a bladder took me to some discomfort during the last hour. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this is that Zizek chose films that were quite obviously full of Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time in the Hitchcock and David Lynch movies, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him trying to support his theories by using a wider range of films, although this is really just me saying that I would like to see part four and five and six. Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor was watching him present what was tantamount to a lecture by inserting himself into the actual scenes of some of the films he is discussing. So, for example, we see him on a speedboat on the way to Bodega Bay (from The Hitchcock's The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). This is not to say that his theories are not provocative. Even when I found myself disagreeing with him, it definitely made me think a little deeper about the movies. Which is exactly what he is trying to accomplish.
