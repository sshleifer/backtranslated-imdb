I just left and I can not believe what a brilliant documentary is. You rarely leave a movie theater with so much astonishment and astonishment. Lately the films have become so exaggerated that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when they first came out and this movie is doing with me now. I did not know anything about it before I got into it and what a surprise. If you listen to the concept, you may have the feeling that this is one of those thrilling movies about an incredible triumph covered with the music from above and trying to convince us completely that great story is being told but will not let us in. Fortunately this is not the movie. People tell the story! It does such a good job of capturing every moment of your involvement as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is so much beyond the climb that it makes everything they spend much more tense. Touching the Void was also a great documentary on mountaineering and shows the intensity of an engaging way, but this film is much more a human story. I only saw it today, but I will say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
