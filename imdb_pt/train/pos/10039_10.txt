Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie does not have ten solid overall ratings for IMDb users. It might be cool not to give credit to the Titanic these days, but when it was done it was really something. When the movie left, people rushed to theaters. When it came out on video my sister and I watched it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forget, such as the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the undisciplined crowd. Many people died on that ship, and broadcasting that on film with the speed and excitement they needed was a difficult challenge to which James Cameron approached. And let's not forget the incredible romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was an invention of someone's imagination was lovely. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They are certainly giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I'll never leave, Jack." Titanic is a great movie right down to its core. It's a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music and a staff full of dedicated and dedicated workers. It really surprises me when someone says they hate this movie.
