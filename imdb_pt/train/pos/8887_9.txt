When I saw the movie, I was really shocked to see what the '60s were doing. I know I may be wrong about some things, but it looked like the 60's really had an effect on people of the time. Some people said they would like to go back to the 60's. From what I saw, I would say yes for the excitement, not the result. But that's my opinion.
