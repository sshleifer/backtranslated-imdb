This is perhaps the best rock documentary of all time - a british, best This Is Spinal Tap. The characters are believable, the plot is great, and you can genuinely empathize with some of the events - like Ray's problem in fitting into the band. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great. Material from the actual period, even if it is in the same key, you will hum some of the songs for days. What I liked was the cast almost all British, with some of the household names. Ray's wife is invaluable ... <br /> <br /> The film never creeps, it just goes at the right pace, and it has some genuinely funny sections in it. A really good phrase generator! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
