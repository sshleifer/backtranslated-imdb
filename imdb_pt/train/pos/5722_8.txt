That was great. When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I've ever seen. It was not blood or guts, it was scary, atmospheric and terrifying. When the ghost mother lent on the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be diluted, and that Buffy would take away the dark and scary nuances of the original version. I did not need to be worried. The creators of this film wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original film and gave the film direction to the same man. They also put him in Japan in the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director struggled to remake the same film that was in the original, the only difference being the cast of American actors. This really turned into a benefit as it added the element "Strangers in a Strange Land" to the overall horror. Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and unforgiving ghost, but they too were stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. This only added to the general anxiety embodied in the film and I thought it was a great touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy really does a great job. She seems vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. There are none of the clever remarks that are so common in American horror movies, or a liner that lessens the general darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was as good as The Ring, which I also liked a lot. I hope the future of American terror will more closely follow the New Japanese Wave of Horror that began with the incredible success of Ringu. We are finally getting movies that really can be categorized as "Horror" !! 8/10
