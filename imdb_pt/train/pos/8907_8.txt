I saw this movie at midnight on Demand on the other night, not knowing what to expect. I had heard of this movie but never had opinions about it. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I was impressed with what I saw. I was really scared in parts and I definitely remember jumping in my place a few times. <br /> <br /> Blob was scary. Now, I look into a jar of jelly and wonder if it will stick in my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the film. I also liked the old one in the beginning. <br /> <br /> For a horror movie from the fifties, this was very well done even by today's standards. 8/10.
