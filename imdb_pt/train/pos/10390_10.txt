Alongside "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It is a real shame not to be as known as the previous films (perhaps because it is based on a story based on legends rather than contemporary or science fiction settings, and that it is British, meaning a smaller market for movies), but it is wonderful to know that deserves that reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all major family films, you can be a kid, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I am currently 18), but you have to enjoy classic movies first. I absolutely adore this movie. It has an extraordinary soundtrack by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic movie score) that rivals any score of John Williams' "Star Wars", a fast but not flashy rhythm, beautiful scenarios, dialogues and use of color sceneries and cinematography) won, and special effects Oscar winners of the last generation (for the time, and some are still impressive). And, of course, June Duprez's muted looks when the Princess rivals Catherine Zeta-Jones's (she even looks like Jones in a way!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movie of the time (alongside "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and really deserves more attention. It's a true adventure of enchantment everywhere, and, along with "Robin Hood", it's my desert island movie that I could watch over and over without getting bored. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
