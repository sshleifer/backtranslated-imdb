A heart shot is wonderful. He brilliantly illustrates the plight of Gary Gimore, a convicted murderer who has sought death. A shot in the heart shows the ordeal Gilmore's family, torn by hatred, went through. This film is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
