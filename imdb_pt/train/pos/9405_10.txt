While Hollywood stagnated during the few years after World War II, England developed a very prolific film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit," inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a costume that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other companies will probably leave the market! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain her dignity? This is an example of one of the great films in which Alec Guinness starred before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It's a good look at the general absurdity of the business world. If you are planning to start any kind of business, you may want to consider watching that movie.
