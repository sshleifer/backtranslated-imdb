Why can not this kind of compact and entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way. The cast is a great ensemble. William Powell displays the true quality of the star. Who knows - maybe he was rehearsing for his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to watch. One can also see why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films. He is a great supporting actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor does above average work in a not very important role. All other hands come into action to make it a fun way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz had a ball directing his. Angry!
