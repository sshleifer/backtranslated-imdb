An excellent cast makes this movie work; all the characters have developed extremely well and of course the actors liked to film this movie. It's not quite the comedy I expected, much more a carefree look at trying to regain youthful glory than obscene humor. . For music fans, there are some subtle references that in themselves are cleverly funny. <br /> <br /> I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies, but a lot of that movie reminded me of Alan Parker's films that I can not help it: imagine if the Commitments really made it big - and then I tried to recapture the said glory 25 years later.
