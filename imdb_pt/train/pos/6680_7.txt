That was different, for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about the eccentrics. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a group of actors almost shared the spotlight, in this farce about aspiring superheroes. The most scandalous was played by Paul Reubens, of the fame of "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is much humor, bright colors and no lull. It's a very fun and light comedy, with nothing but silly characters, all of whom want to be Superman heroes, Batman, Spiderman, their name. They have talents in strange areas, however, that the real heroes do not (and do not want to!). It's silly, but you know it. <br /> <br /> It is also a movie that you can watch in installments and not lose any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so take a break here and no problem. The language was gentle so the children could enjoy that too. In fact, I do not remember any swear words here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept saying, "What an idiot and fuck movie." I thought it was fun two hours, but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take some breaks.
