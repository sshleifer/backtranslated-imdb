This movie was excellent, I thought the original was quiet mediocre. This, however, has all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger factory with 4-speed transmission that really shows that Mopar mother knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski paved that big Hemi block, and he sure did a lot :)
