A touching little movie and not just for kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any indication of Inspector Morse about him). The boy who played the role of William also did a good job, although I did not find him convincing in all the scenes. I loved the feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those days. I also felt the scenes in London, where historically accurate, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> I strongly remembered a Scandinavian film that I saw a few years ago called the Mother of Mine. This movie showed a boy being evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the family who took him asked for a girl because (as it turns out) she lost her daughter. Getting a boy instead, she completely ignores him. The fact that the Finnish-speaking boy complicates things further. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Goodnight Mr. Tom, it has the same feel.
