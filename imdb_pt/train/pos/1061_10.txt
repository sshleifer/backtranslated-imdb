all the acting done in the first season was really incredible. the first look you get from Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or as I like to call them minis. the minis do the best acting job I've ever seen kids do. the main actors and actresses, like Jessica Alba, Michael Weatherly etc., make you forget that you are watching a fictional program. show that they seem to make this show come to life. In short, this is the best show I've ever watched
