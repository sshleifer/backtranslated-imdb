The number of times I have tears in my eyes watching a movie are few. And there was only one time when I actually cried and it was when I saw this movie. This movie has some kliches but I really do not care. I really do cry as I write this and it's been a while since I've seen it. It is perfectly represented and all production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know this in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. It is only when we love that we are truly alive. I know how sentimental I look and I promise I'm not usually that way. I'm pretty cynical. This film has brought stronger feelings of sadness and happiness in me than any other film and will probably always be the first movie I recommend that others see.
