Movie very well done. This is in your memory. Better described as romance than flying or war, although the flying parts are realistic and almost error-free. Flight enthusiasts, like me, will appreciate this movie, even if attracted by the planes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never fallen in love. <br /> <br /> Fun watching Crowe early. It is good and exudes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is superb. <br /> <br /> Praise, Boom
