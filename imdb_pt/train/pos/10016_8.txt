If there is one thing to recommend about this movie is that it is intriguing. The premise certainly appeals to the public because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are indications that there is something obscure about it. However, there is not much tension, and the gentle portrait of Williams does not do much to make us relate to his obsession with the boy. <br /> <br /> Collete fared much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production seemed rushed and the holes apparent. It certainly seems like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something really good to inspire at least a laudable effort.
