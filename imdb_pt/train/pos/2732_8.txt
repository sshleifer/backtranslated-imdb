Herbet Clutter, his wife Bonnie and their teens Kenyon and Nancy were very dear and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959 all four were brutally murdered. Somewhat unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the author Truman Capote who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case until its completion. The result was the book IN FRID BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well written, it has become an international bestseller and remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book. in itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life venues, it has a slightly documentary, chilled and outstanding quality - and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the movie that rests the reputation of Robert Blake as an actor, and deservedly. Like the killer Perry Smith, Blake catches you between a deep disgust and the shock of unexpected sympathy; is a masterful performance from start to finish. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less good. Like Capote's book, the film begins with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and take them to the Clutter house-crime detailing the investigation that ultimately resulted in their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened at Clutter's house; Actually filmed at Clutter House itself, it's a horrible and deeply disturbing spinning sequence. <br /> <br /> Director-writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that it allows the film to become slightly boring. Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial hassle. Strong material - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
