This story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate in two different ways. It is a touching film narrated by the director, Robert Redford, interpreting the old Norman and reflecting on times past and people long dead. <br /> <br /> Certain themes appear in the film, such as memory, death, eternity. and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around Paul's almost tragic hero. He is a capable man, charming and brave, but he has his fatal flaws. The closing lines sum up the "point" of the film: "So in the arctic half-light of the canyon, the whole existence fades into a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river passes through it. And some of the words are theirs, I am haunted by the waters. "
