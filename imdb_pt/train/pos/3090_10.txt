I'm so upset that ABC is giving up another show that has a chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the writing and the plot were great, an original idea for a show instead of another annoying reality show. The cast was spectacular! Not only the characters and actors were right, but these are a very talented set of actors. Concept and idea are really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of ​​"connections." I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not one person attached to this program that I did not like, even those who only participated in a few episodes (Sheri Appleby, for example). The acting and the characters are so easy to like and so talented! I wish ABC would have given more to this show, and did not interrupt the show in the middle of the way, either was not announced enough. Truly unfair !! for all!!. This show showed a great promise. I, for example, will let ABC know how I feel and will continue to send emails to keep this program alive. Please, join me, I know we can do this. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where's episode 13? I want this last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!!
