I had no idea what this movie was or even knew it existed until about a month ago, when I stumbled when I was looking for other movies that faced Dominic Monaghan. I thought this movie was a weird sight of the mind of the one who does not sleep and what their mind may be going through in the hours they wake up when the rest of the world around them is sleeping, it was an interesting movie and a good part was interpreted by Dom ....... I believe that even if this movie you can not buy anywhere (well, I've never seen it anywhere) you should see it if you have the chance because it will really make you think of those people around us who can not sleep and who have to suffer night after night not having been able to sleep or just having about 1 hour of sleep each night so overall it was an interesting substance good movie.
