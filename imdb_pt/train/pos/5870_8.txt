JACKNIFE is a beautiful adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow," directed by David Hugh Jones, which explores the forgotten effect of the battle on veterans permanently damaged by the hideous cruelties of the war. It is especially touching to return to this 1989 film now as we watch soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the raw treatment they are receiving at our Veterans' Hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam. War together and only two returned alive: the problem is that while the two men suffered in battle, David 'High School' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so severely damaged by the post-traumatic stress syndrome that he 'exists' in a vacuum of alcohol Professor Martha (Kathy Baker). As David deteriorates his friend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to town in an attempt to help his friend. In the course of events, Jacknife first offers help to Martha, and eventually the two date each other - at a graduation prom - and at the prom David completely disintegrates, destroying relics at school and terrorizing the city's inhabitants and students . Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their friends and in so doing takes David to the point where he can begin his climb toward recovery. And the distressed Martha thinks her needs are also met by Jacknife. <br /> <br /> All three actors perform surprisingly well: Ed Harris offers one of his most complete roles while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards. defined by their careers. More people should help resurrect this film, but forgotten, for it is a fragile reminder of the damage our wars bring to the men who fight them and the families who receive them after the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
