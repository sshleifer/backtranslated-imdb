A potent little bonbon whose length of 65 minutes does not look like a very short second, My name is Julia Ross dates back to an English tradition of things that are not what they seem - The Lady Vanishes by Hitchcock is an example. Off-duty, Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new London employment agency whose sinister representative seems very eager to see if she has any living relatives or a boyfriend. After reporting to duty, she wakes up (having been drugged) in an immense pile of Manderley off the coast of Cornwall, supposedly as George Macready's wife, who shows an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. . Her loving and irresistible mother is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of rushing efficiency on the other side of the good versus evil that she occupied in Mrs. Vanish). The nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically; we know what is happening, but we are powerless to say to poor Julia. This film, curiously, regularly receives a place of honor like one of the first (and very few British) films noirs. I think it is closer to the Gothic tradition of the house of darkness than the American cobblestones and urban corruption; however, shows a more modern psychoanalytic mentality. Whatever you call it remains a keenly satisfying thriller.
