This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. It is not realistic, but it should not be. The only thing I did not like was that the girl trusted the guy so much. It represents the way of thinking of the time period. I have been trying to catch this movie for so long and it is not available for the American format only in the UK and will not play on American DVD players. It is, unfortunately, a classic movie about look! Believe it or not, but this movie can easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad we did not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or ours. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character who makes lemonade with lemons. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
