"Timothy Hines's War of Classical Worlds" is a very entertaining film that obviously strives to faithfully recreate the classic book by H. G. Wells. Mr. Hines can do it. Me and those who watched your movie with me, appreciate the fact that it was not the standard and predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, Spielberg's version of Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who imagine themselves as amateur "critics" only look to criticize everything they can. Others classify a film on more important grounds, such as having fun, which is why most people never agree with "critics." We appreciate the effort Mr. Hines has put into being faithful to H. G. Wells's classic novel, and we think it's a lot of fun. This made it easy to ignore what "critics" perceive as their shortcomings.
