I saw this movie for the first time when I was freshman in high school, and the movie stayed with me over the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and a bit of bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind it is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and you're still in high school, and it's not a bad thing either, but it's a problem. Thousands of girls I knew are all having kids now, and I do not think they ever watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly did not understand the message behind everything. It's about not risking when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant for the first time. It is not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but they have to stay in the back seat in your future because you have a child to think about first. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message behind it: SAY NO!
