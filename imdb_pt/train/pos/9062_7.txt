It's a weekend I watched this funny movie. and I really like it. all the children are cute, they remind me of my own childhood with this stupid thought. is a real entertainment film for a group of families on weekend night which can make lots of memories and laughs. The boy's mood always works. good acting too. simple story, but cool shot. Good job finding the boy's way. when it comes to children's film, I think of "12 and hold". another this year, but differed aspect of the child's world, which is real and cruel. great job. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood that every child and family need. p. Twitch, I think, is Nemo's voice of "Finding Nemo."
