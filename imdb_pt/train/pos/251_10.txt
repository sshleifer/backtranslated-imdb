"If Ned Kelly was born later, he probably would have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli." such was Ned's Bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially in Victoria country, the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta he is still a hero, the bloodlust of the city of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they still have not forgotten that the three policemen he 'murdered' were from there. <br /> <Many of the buildings he has visited in his life are still standing. From Old Melbourne Gaol, where he was hanged, to the post office, he resisted Jerilderie. A cell he has been detained in Greta is on display at Benella and at the site of the Ann Jones' Hotel, the station and even the trunks where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited. Evidence of all the events of the film (except for their love interest) can be found throughout Victoria, on police records and even on the track that Ned received to rescue Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what was left out would further justify Ned's actions. The Horse that Ned 'stole' was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man with whom Ned boxed after being released from prison). Ned was already in prison when the horse was stolen, so he could not have stolen it. <br /> <br /> The Letter of Jerilderie is more than what was said before. It is not self-justification, it is Ned's biography, an outline of what he represented and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read, watch the movie and then decide what Ned meant.
