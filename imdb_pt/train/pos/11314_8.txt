Wow!! The kind of movie you can watch ten times and still indulge in your nuances. Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut film, I shudder to think of what would happen if he adapted better from film to film. The only other one I saw (at the time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely amazing: more visually stunning than Ossessione (Obsession). One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but its story was not as engrossing as Ossessione. If you click on "miscellaneous" in the links on this page, there are pictures of the movie on those sites. They will not do justice to the experience of the film: such graceful camera movements, such a beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such wonderful characters, a development of a great story, the first film adapted from James M Cain's The Postman Always Rings. Twice. "<br /> <br /> I can not believe this was done in 43, eight years before Brando introduced a realistic performance in the world with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). <br /> <br /> Actors may not have used the technique of method , that is, they may not have really felt it all alone (I do not know anything about it) - but they are some of the best, most genuine and realistic performances to date.In addition, eight years before Streetcar Named Desire bring a new sensuality for the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! <br /> <br /> The most sensual since the beginning of the cinema! <br /> <br /> The reason why Ossessione did not make the impact which Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banished by Mussolini, and cut in America. <br /> <br /> The American public did not see all its glory until the 59, eight years after Streetcar. <br /> <br /> I do not I will say nothing more about it - just write endo to say that it is one of the best, most beautiful and exciting. movies I've seen, and tell you to go out and see! As another reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I can find it!
