I love this movie so much I watched it over and over. I do not see why anyone would think this movie was not good. Maybe you've seen better or whatever I personally love. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman", but I have not seen it and I do not think it's better than that. I do not know why you're all ruining this, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I've said enough, but I absolutely love this movie, and for those who say it's not good at all, so I wonder why you watch it and what movies you consider good. As for all the others I've watched they like it too, so it surprises me that a lot of people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think you spell her last name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress!
