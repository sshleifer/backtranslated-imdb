I saw this movie and the play, and I have to add that this was the most touching story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I did not know how horrible life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults who lived at that time. This brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to fight like this to stay alive, and bring the children out of that area and teach them to act, preform and release them to tell their own story is simply amazing. That simply exceeds five stars, I classify as ten. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story was told, it is still one that puts heavy on my heart. If there is a VHS, or DVD out there in the game, please let me know ASAP. Thank you. PS There was nothing wrong with children who wanted to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in the hope that someone would have a heart and offer assistance.
