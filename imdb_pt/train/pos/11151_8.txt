The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic Top 100. For a top 100, it's not a well-known movie; in fact, I had to search a lot to find a copy, I have the DVD version for about half the price. Surprisingly, only M15 + was rated (the uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will take notice of this review (more as a comment), so I'll make it brief. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic footage (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the movie that I still do not understand (I've seen it twice), and this makes an emotionally confusing movie. <br /> <br /> Filming and acting were very good, and it's the larger-than-life characters that make this movie memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a Texas cowboy who moves to New York to become a prostitute. He meets the boring con man Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course, they become friends through the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is that the two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not actually develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection, although the ending is certainly very sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews, but it's pretty obvious from the start. <br /> <br /> I personally think the film explores beautifully and poignantly its main themes. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the city streets, the tenements). Most of the characters in the movie exist beyond the law (a conman, giggolo.etc), but you can not help liking them. Joe Buck is captivating because he is so naive and optimistic as we begin to feel sorry for Ratso later in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very innovative for its period. At the time (and so far) it was definitely not a typical movie (rather art-house). At a time when filmmaking was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas, a movie with a theme as unusual as Midnight Cowboy appears. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I must say that I really enjoyed the movie. The images conveyed a dreamlike quality. I particularly enjoyed the scene at the party, the music, pictures etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However, as a film for the sake of entertainment it was a bit lacking (not really my movie style) in excitement. This is a movie to be savored and enjoyed, rather than an action movie of cheap emotion. Although I hardly considered myself qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, though it does not yet seem to be relevant to the story. He is a carefree young stallion, who suppresses his darkest memories. The religious connotations in the film are also intriguing. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, though I can not see where they got the idea from. The subject of homosexuality in general is more than touched on in their conversations, and later on in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but has little to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (it has more of the feel of the 70s than a sensation of the 60s) and revolutionary for its time, addressing subjects that few others movies dared to do. Although it has a simple and sentimental story (disguised by a hard edge), the beauty of the film is in the strange sequences, often psychedelic.
