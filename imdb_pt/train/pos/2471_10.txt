I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I attended it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow the dialogue through it. My opinion of the film may be partly biased, since I had never read the play before, but was pulled into the scope of the film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers to live and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now let's go to the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found out that all the actors in the film had a firm grasp of what they were saying so they could articulate it very well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I liked about it was that it worked very well as a "MOVIE" and not as a piece that you are studying. You do not need to be rich with Shakespeare to relate to all the Misery villages that have to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> These are my two cents.
