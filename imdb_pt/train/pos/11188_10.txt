I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this movie made me an even bigger King fan. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They just moved into a new house and they look happy. But there's an animal graveyard behind their house. New neighbor Judge Credo (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the cemetery behind the pet graveyard. This cemetery is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human (or any type of pet) in the graveyard, they come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they are not the same person, they are bad. Soon after Jud explains everything about Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I will no longer explain why I do not want to reveal some of the main parts of the film. The performance of Pet Sematary was very good, but it needed a bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was so original and exciting. This film features many makeup effects that make the movie more scary and scary. One of the most basic reasons why this movie caused me shivers was actually the effects of makeup. There is a character in this movie that is truly strange. This character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the movie about three times to be precise. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed who passed away years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie is not usually scary, because she is not talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares my life. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Sematary Pet offers great scares, some good performances, first-line plot and hypnotizing makeup. This is truly one of the most favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
