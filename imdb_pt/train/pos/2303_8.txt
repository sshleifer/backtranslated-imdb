THE MAN IN THE MOON is a heartwarming, moving drama centered on a family of farmers in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) falling in love with her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters the dynamics of this family forever. The 1950s are affectionately evoked here and the script gives you characters that you care about almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to showcase the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this starring role and London makes a charming leadership man. Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister who is effective as well. Many compliments to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play the parents of the girls and Gail Strickland, who plays the mother of London. I was unexpectedly moved by this silent drama that affects strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties."
