SPOILERS Sex right? It is one of the most basic parts of human life. However, do we take this very seriously? People always want more, even those they receive daily, and if you get unlucky, there are potential changes in life (creating) consequences. Ironically, people claim that we are all starting to have sex at an ever younger age (though Victorians get married and have children in their early teens), so it should be increasingly difficult for those who reach a point as virgins. In the first screen of Steve Carell, he plays a man who reached 40 without administering it. Treating us with countless incidents involving extreme and playful sex, not to mention more profanity than an episode of "Eurotrash", the overall plot of the film and its principle does not sound funny. It is a pleasant surprise, therefore, that for all the inappropriate jokes, there are an incredibly large number of people who hit the mark and leave the public in hysteria. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a cool guy. with a good job and a nice temperament. At the same time, he takes life very seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At age 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for many reasons, but mostly worth it, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) offer all of Andy's advice with one goal in mind. To put you out of your misery and take you to bed. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about "Anchor" would be just a matter of time before Steve Carell got a lead in his life. own. Impressively, in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" he does not disappoint. Showing the hopeless and timid virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as he grows more and more confident as the council begins to help. <br /> <br /> However, Carell is not alone in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as the love interest are all superb. Rudd is a personal favorite as sick love David, who collapses on several occasions and shares the best scene with Rogen as the two argue about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise about this movie is not the way so many of the jokes hit the target, but it's actually the smart way to put the message in your head. Obviously designed for conservative America, the whole tone of the film evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest to one of safe sex and abstinence. A virgin does not need sex to complete her life, he just needs trust and true love. A message worth preaching, and a considerable improvement over what you expect to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see a raw comedy that is consistently funny and well represented, but low and behold that "40 Year Old Virgin" is that. Add a meaningful message and you're on your way to a top-notch comedy. An amazing joy.
