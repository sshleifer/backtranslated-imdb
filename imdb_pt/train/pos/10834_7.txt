I did not approach "Still Crazy" with any real expectations. Just another rock'n'roll photo, I figured ... good nostalgia for the baby boomers. This movie is partly this, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, has directed a biography of Tina Turner, and is successful in his style. I suppose it is appropriate that this was his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as lead singer of the band. The actor who turned director Bruce Robinson appears as the band's guitarist. He does a great job, though he has not appeared in movies since the late 1970s. If you're looking for a moving and funny movie (great music), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 of 10
