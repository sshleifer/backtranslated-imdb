First, there is no way the remake is so good, because Japanese society is very different from ours and plays such an important role in this film as explained in the opening story. It adds to the mood as well as heat of this movie. There are a huge amount of different characters / supporting personalities. Each one is part of making this wonderful movie. This movie is full of comedy that is not vulgar, like most of the "coarse comedies" of today. However, you may still have you laughing loudly. The reality is that in real life, you have no choice who you work with or go to school ... etc. This film really emphasizes this and shows that the natural good in people can overcome small differences. Not to mention, it makes a great sub-plot and a lot of humor. This is a story about dancing that really has a story and a good story. There are some stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main plot. Truly a well written movie. The dance is great too. I'm a fan of any dance film of any kind, by that aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that, it is a story first and only happens to be written about dance in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
