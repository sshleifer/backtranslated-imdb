I imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would become an icon and start "Wanted: Dead of Alive" the same year this movie came out, or would be at The Magnificent Seven two years later, he would not have done it. But he did, and we are the richest for this. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a camp classic. Horror the way it should be for the drive-in cinema. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the last lines of the movie were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic gets cold. <br /> <br /> They never imagined, 52 years ago, that the Arctic would be thawing. Blob will return soon.
