I'm really shocked to see the number of comments you've licked this movie. This movie was not meant to be a "deep thought" movie, which is what the vast majority of reviewers seem to think it should be. In fact, it seems that if ANY movie does not produce life-altering insight, and a deep, twisted, bewildering storyline, they would rate it as 1 or 2. Do not destroy a movie because you do not like the genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy film, and it was all it was meant to be. And for an action / comedy, it was very well done. I was quite surprised that I liked it as much as I did, never having been a fan of Jamie Foxx, and having the super-used plot he has. <br /> <br /> The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal comes out of prison, and is thrown into the villainous plot while trying to clear his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.), but it was warmed up with a bit of a technological twist. Now, the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the REAL "villain" is a genius. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincing mood, while being quite intelligent and intelligent. serious main character, and do not try to exaggerate the humor side of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep underlying plot, like in "The Matrix" or a drama like "De Mice and Men," then this movie is not for you. But if you like raw action, great fast-paced shooting and an occasional twist of humor, this movie will not disappoint you. I would normally have rated an 8 (at the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave a 10 to try to bring the score down to what it should be. <br /> <br />
