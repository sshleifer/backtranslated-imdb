The main problem of the first movie "Vampires" is that none of the characters was nice. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is certainly the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts like a cool restaurant scene in slow motion (why did not Carpenter use it anymore ??), this movie is far from as good as it could have been. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least a more well-choreographed fight sequence (for example, within a town) and I was a bit disappointed. While "Los Muertos" continues at a faster rate than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though not nearly as bad as "Vampires" did). Much like "Vampires", however, the climax of this film near the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it definitely is not. It is generally pleasant and is among the best entries for the genre. It's neither a remake of Dracula without originality (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it a clever action show like Blade II. It just could have used a little more emotion. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to see a third installment made by Carpenter, but it's probably not going to happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING ending was very predictable. Una should have run away - that would have made the movie quite unusual.
