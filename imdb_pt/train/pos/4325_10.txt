This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me. The representation of the Chancery Court as a 'character' in the drama is magnificent. The acting is wonderful, from the sinister Tulkinghorn to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But it's the spider chancery web that holds everything together, and the cinematography is superb. What error did the BBC make about copyright, meaning that this version could not be seen in the UK on video or DVD for many years? I tried to figure them out, but I faced a stone wall. In the end, I received a DVD copy of Canada.
