Pleasant story of the Pimlico community in London that, after blowing up an unexploded Second World War bomb, finds a royal letter stating that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it attracts fantasy that many of us have about creating our own rules and not having to listen to them. A solid cast of British believers, especially Stanley Holloway, makes this more believable. <br /> <br /> There are some very good moments in the film, like when people ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side. side of the barricade start throwing food and other stuff at them. <br /> <br /> Even if you always knew that Pimlico would become part of the UK again, the people of Pico and as a consequence the viewer does not care when this happens, leaving a pleasant and happy feeling. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to think that these low budget films from a small studio in London are still so popular more than fifty years later. The producers must have been right.
