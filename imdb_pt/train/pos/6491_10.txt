World At War is perhaps the greatest series of documentaries of all time. Historical research is practically flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary on World War II. An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures of the war. I strongly recommend it as a learning experience.
