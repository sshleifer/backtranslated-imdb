My Super X-Girlfriend is a hell of a roller coaster. The special effects were excellent and the costumes Uma Thurman wore were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underrated comedy actress, but she proved everyone was wrong and preached her role as a lunatic girlfriend. She was simply FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was also good as ordinary Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The supporting cast was also excellent, especially Anna Faris, who was extremely good (much better than the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did very well in directing this film, because if it were not for him and Uma Thurman, this movie would not have done so well. This film is clearly a 10/10 for the cast (Uma Thurman), is the director, is screenplay and the original plot. This movie is highly recommended.
