Of course Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) beats everyone else in special effects, but this movie has it all! <br /> <br /> Has horror (non-graphic), romance, robots, spirits replicas, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects, and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a few years ago in a revival with a newcomer impression, and I was amazed at how well it lasted today. I thought the old electronics of the 1940s would look cheesy, but somehow they looked futuristic and modern. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a feminine innocence that is hard to beat yet a climb off of me. <br /> <br /> The monster Krell that appears in the rays of light still scares the bejebees out of me. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that the "Big Bird of the Galaxy" has probably modeled a lot of "Star Trek" from this movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody has yet to beat Robby the Robot in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film, in general, is the standard that all other Science Fiction films will have to measure up to! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for the astonishing electronic soundtrack that kept us all in pins and needles.
