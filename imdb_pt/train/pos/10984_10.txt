One question that should be asked immediately is: Would this movie have been made if the women were not Jacqueline Lee's cousin and aunt Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. But, fortunately, they are (or were) Jackie's cousin and aunt. <br /> <br /> This documentary of the Maysles brothers about the existence (hardly could be called life) of Edith B. Beale, Jr., and its daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), has the same call of an accident by train - you do not want to look, but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once-magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly decaying around them. The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> Magnificent oil painting leaning against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them when young women vying for space on the walls next to old magazine covers. <br /> <br /> Living alone for many years has brought down many barriers between the two women, but raised others. <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be optional. Edie's favorite outfit is a pair of shorts with a pantyhose pulled over them and bits of cloth wrapped around the torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says, "Edie is still beautiful at age 56." And indeed she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that already existed. <br /> <br /> There is a constant trend of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Your eating habits are be polite) weird. Ice cream spread over crackers. A dinner for Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served in fine china with plastic utensils. <br /> <br /> Time is irrelevant in your world; as Edie says, "I have no watch." <br /> <br /> Their relationships with men are so strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels as if Edith had thwarted any of her happiness attempts. She says, "If you can not make a man propose to you, you may be dead." To which Edith replies, "I'll take a dog some day." <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of male companionship. At the beginning of the film, she states that "France has fallen, but Edie does not." It is sometimes difficult to hear exactly what is being said. There's a strange relationship with animals throughout the film: Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food. Cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> At one point Edie declares "The mark of the aristocracy is responsibility." But they seem to be incapable of taking responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie to watch, but it's worth the effort.
