Just as Al Gore shook us with his painfully honest documentary and skillfully presented "An Inconvenient Truth," directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it's time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a warning that global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the bleak future of planet Earth by presenting concrete facts backed up by examples documented through long, but always interesting, monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not present us with a future representation of what can happen to our planet if we do not radically change the things around us, but they show us the genuine beauty of planet Earth in all its incredible glory. We see places we knew existed but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film we see a great variety of the most extraordinary places, such as deserted deserts, gigantic forests full of fauna and flora, and frozen landscapes as far as the eye could see. And in all these immensely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of movie that had to be done, in combination with Al Gore's, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to intrude. Patrick Stewart's voice is always relaxing and therefore very well made, although at first it sounded like I was watching an X-Men movie! Cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing about this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all those delightful scenes. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: This is definitely a must-see for everyone since it pertains to every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is that I never thought our planet was so incredibly beautiful!
