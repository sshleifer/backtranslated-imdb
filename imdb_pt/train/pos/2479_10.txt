(Sorry for my faulty language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a film that almost requires an overwhelming reaction. Personally I agree with all the superlatives out there. But I'm not going to use this somewhat pointless way to describe the movie here. Because those "perfect! The one and the best! Always!" Criticism causes some people to turn away (including me). <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another 'Hamlet' that has the potential to rival many theatrical and all cinematic - So do not miss this if you happen to find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, a lot of people will not get the chance to see it. It looks like there's no DVD out there, and the German version - which is very well made - is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> Just in case you decide to get a copy: Save two hours (or more) the version of this movie. It's no use and it's not fun, and it gives the wrong impression of a movie, which deals interestingly with the flow and architecture. And the aspect ratio of 4: 3 is also reduced.
