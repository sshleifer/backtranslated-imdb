I loved the story. Somewhere, a poster said there are no families like the one pictured in this movie. Well, maybe it should exist. I thought everyone looked really human and believable. What a high level cast. What good music on the soundtrack. How cool this, and how cool this, but most of all, I will say two words to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He really showed a good subtle depth that touched me. He was actually commanding as a widower who devoted himself perhaps a little too much to being a good father first, at the cost of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like a petulant idiot? Why, yes he did. <br /> <br /> And you see, that's what was perfect about this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that he was FEELING something, not simply ACTING, as if he was feeling something, and he conveyed perfectly to me what he was feeling, and what he was feeling was denied. <br /> <br /> Denied happiness. <br /> <br /> Denied compliance. <br /> <br /> Denied love. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do it will never feel this way again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight in ten.
