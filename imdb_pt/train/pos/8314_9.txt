The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a group of famous girls. In her efforts, the older sister meets a drug dealer and street hooker named Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the "big time" that will give her everything she thought she wanted out of life. Although he could be accused of killing her, he really only kills her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes addicted to drugs and eventually dies of overdose. The story is not about street life or about the Italian mobster trying to buy Stix, then the threat, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies of life as portrayed in music and style and the character who was the life in the times for young women trying to be "discovered" at that time.
