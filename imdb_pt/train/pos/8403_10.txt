I found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! I felt the script was conveying all the things I feel physically and emotionally when I got home from work and watched it. this is a tribute to the cinema in the highest form and format. <br /> <br /> Sacred guacamole! how I wish these days would come again. I tried to put a blister window on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but the vacuum formed muffin trays failed to cut it. also in my civic, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by the water bed, as it is brilliantly represented in the van. <br /> <br /> "The van" is on the higher side that divides hilarity and can even replace porn if you watch some particular scenes. <br /> <br /> I anticipate that Sam Grossman (the director) got his work. <br /> <br /> Classifications john: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
