'One-Round' Jack Sander is named so because he is a carnival boxer who fights against any man in the audience. If they can last a round, they win a prize - a popular way of attracting customers to itinerant shows a long time ago. Jack is in love with the box office girl, Mabel, although his head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What nobody in the fight knows is that Bob is the champion, so he is able to defeat Jack - although it does take some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his partner and give up the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he climbed the ranks until he was almost ready to face the Champion. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the Champ and Mabel start running behind Jack's back - even if Mabel has been married so far. Jack. So when the final fight takes place between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will it increase justifiable anger against Bob's help or hurt his performance? Tune in and see. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this type of movie looks strange to a director known for mystery thriller movies, in the 1920s, Hitchcock did not have a fixed genre that he directed or wrote (he did both for this movie). In fact, in many ways, this film is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar storyline emerged in one of his forthcoming silences, THE MANXMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband). So while this looks a lot like a standard boxing movie of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director - even with his rather stereotypical ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, while somewhat predictable and Having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ looks silly, the movie works well. Although far from perfect, it is worth seeing it and gives a good punch.
