I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and was impressed by the similarity of the story to the much superior "Rebecca". As others have said, you have the sweet young thing swept from your feet by the alternately charming and moody lord of the mansion, only to find your marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a relative greater than life, but deeply flawed. You have the stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either unite the couple or tear them irreparably, culminating in the burning destruction of generous property. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also owes some of its scary atmosphere in the jungle to "The Letter," the love triangle of Bette Davis set in a rubber plantation in Singapore instead of a plantation of Sri Lankan tea. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars and IMDb readers are not very kind, but I enjoyed it despite predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked more adorable, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to get rid of the influence of his domineering father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in "Laura" and "The Best Year of Our Lives" - is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful scenes in the history of cinema.
