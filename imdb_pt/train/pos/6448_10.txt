Kay Pollack (the man behind this movie) is a great man who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He wrote a lot of good and well written books on how to control his senses and keep his soul happy. The message in most of your books and this movie, is about what your thoughts actually are what causes your problems and that the reason your anger is almost never caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but you almost never do. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important in life, you have to keep your mind wide open and LISTEN to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines for going through life) that most parts of this movie contains if you listen and watch. Watch with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn to live and get the most out of it ... <br /> <br /> So while watching, remember: <br /> <br /> "The mind is like a parachute, it does not work unless it's open!"
