Following a sitcom plan is so easy that having your character operating simultaneously in and out of the context that the rest of the cast inhabits is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could actually use. The supporting characters base the show on a sitcom reality that provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's erratic persona who, in addition to general insensitivity, does not have specific recurring traits for behavioral expectations, making her less a character than a screen to be repainted each episode, if not the scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to go unnoticed. Every time she talks it's like an independent 5-second sketch. It survives a lot by demonstrating the myriad things that a smile or change in tone of voice can mean but never sticks to an idea long enough for you to feel comfortable and form expectations that will be met. This may be the most creative, original and experimental TV show of all time.
