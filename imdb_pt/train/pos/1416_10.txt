TERRA is a must see for kids and adults alike. My son had a great time watching all those funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some endangered animals to disappear. Exactly this problem must prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional images that I have never seen before. So it is well accompanied by a heavenly song. The director did a great job here that gets great respect. Nothing can stop me and my family from giving EARTH the highest rate. I wait so long for the material to create a sequence.
