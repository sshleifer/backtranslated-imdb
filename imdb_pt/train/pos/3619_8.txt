Despite the best efforts of Disney, this is a pretty nice film about following your dreams. I was surprised that I did not seem overly sentimental; this movie was played fairly. Dennis Quaid was very, very good on paper, which is saying something to a sports movie. I do not remember how many sports movies had small quirks that bother me; here, everyone looks like the paper. This movie is surprisingly good, and I predict it will do amazing deals, since it's an electronic censorship movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert to the contrary, this movie is a success.
