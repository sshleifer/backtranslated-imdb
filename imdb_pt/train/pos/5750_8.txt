But the rest of us who love a good emotional and sentimental story that is a block for you to cry ... pleasure! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow garbageboy who loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone most of the time and tends to make questionable judgments. He really wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud of him. He stops at the church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie really gets started. <br /> <br /> You're not about to give anything here, but the film is extremely engaging and sad and moving. Those without fear of these things will have a picnic with this beautiful story, their love characters and a great song that I can not quote here, which has nothing to do with the film, but is strangely appropriate ... but you hear in a bar <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, since he was for 'Amadeus', I figured this could give him a clue to actually win. No such luck. Liotta is so good, but has less emotional impact, but later does it later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have much paper here, but it was cool of her to lend her name to a little Pittsburgh drama about two brothers you'll never forget.
