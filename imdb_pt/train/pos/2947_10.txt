If you have not seen it yet, you do not know what you're missing out on. The first time you do this, you will feel pain on the floor, vomiting from so much laughter, and having probably gotten wet too. <br /> <br /> It's so funny. There has not been a single comedic performance for this date that I've seen that either overcomes it or comes close. There are so many linings, stories and classic segways. <br /> <br /> Uncle drunk on the barbecue, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goo goo goo, ice cream, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I bet with dollars for donuts that they will not be able to keep a serious face and will burst into laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Classic !! It's a shame that you can not burn it to DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
