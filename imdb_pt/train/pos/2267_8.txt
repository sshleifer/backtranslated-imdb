I have not read the novel, or anything else from Kurt Vonnegut, but now I intend to begin. This locks you from the first frame and does not release it until the end credits are started. Taking you places you do not expect, the plot is interesting throughout. The pace is perfect, nothing lasts for long, and it does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we saw. It is well told and well thought out. I've never watched a movie that I feel I could compare this particularly. It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. The performance is excellent, Nolte absolutely shines, Goodman proves he does not need to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are fascinating. I could go on, really ... no role is treated with less than stellar performance. The editing and the cinematography are wonderful, and all the visuals are great, with some unforgettable and amazing. I go to other films directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two seemingly related to this, through the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality and a very disturbing and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; Unpleasant. 8/10
