* WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The writers of this story knew these men very well. The actors, in the same way, portrayed them very well. The result is that by the end of the movie you feel like you're actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions are there, especially in the first embarrassing moments. But when the two begin to let go, the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well begins to show. The bitterness is still there and sometimes interrupts, but when John has the idea of ​​taking Lorne Michaels to offer the Beatles the sum of $ 3,000 to appear on Saturday Night Live, the two may be the same boy playboys who terrorized Liverpool together as a teenager, and survived playing in Hamburg's rustic nightclubs to reach the SuperStrato. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy fits us gently. We are reminded why a meeting of the Beatles was probably never possible even before Lennon's murder: the two driving forces of the group were overcome.
