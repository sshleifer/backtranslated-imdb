Beautifully done. Much anguish. Friendship may not last, but in the end it's all that matters, or so a group of friends learns. I watched it over and over again. The music is also incredible. When Kei loses the friend he has, he gives up until he finds Sho, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa, they struggle for their own place among a mix of Asian races, and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ready to pay. A surprise ending that grabs as much as the whole movie does. I could not get enough. Gackt and Hyde do a marvelous acting job, proving they are more than handsome kids singing.
