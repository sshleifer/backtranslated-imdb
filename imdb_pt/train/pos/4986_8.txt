Lensman is a lesser-known anime gem from Toho and MK studios. It's loosely based on the novel, but it reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see in Japanese with subtitles or simply in Japanese. The version dubbed in English was almost cut and edited to the death. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a breakthrough, though it's the first animated feature to combine CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch, though.
