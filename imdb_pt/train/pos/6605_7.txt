2054. Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles running on various levels in an obvious tribute to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is ultramodern and disintegrates in decay. And in the blink of an eye amid surveillance scans, a young medical researcher is abducted shortly after leaving her sister in a decadent nightclub. A hard police captain investigates. Shown in black and white, with dark hallways, dark alleys and unique fountain lighting feature more noir film, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story is due more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller, since high-tech surveillance, the invisible and almost invisible super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film never bears the miserable atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its fringe tech characters bumping into industrial types of corporations that seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer definitely has the feeling that future Paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent. And as the police process unfolds, we are led into the darker nooks of individual ambition under the glittering varnish of the cultured public relations image of the Avalon corporation. The motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between black and white comics and the next generation of rotoscopy, and it's captivating or intrusive, depending on your taste. However, a great visual sense is on display here, and the future Paris is filled up to the minute details that give the image a unique look, which is both Spartan and Baroque alternative. Worth a look.
