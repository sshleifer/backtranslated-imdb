This movie has some of the greatest comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever assembled in a movie! The plot is a bit lacking, but the delightful jokes are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please. As a cinematic art form, it's a lot of fun; and with great stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> The dialogue and timing of comedians like this one have been underestimated and are very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 imitation of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received bad reviews and comments from viewers. Achieving true comic dialogue is an art.
