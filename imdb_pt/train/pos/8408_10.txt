"It was not me! It was, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when confronted about being in Sally's place. I have used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet to believe it, though). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best of all time for pure amusement and disbelief. Steven Oliver was perfect for the role of Dugan, so much so that he was in Malibu Beach in 1978 as the same character (not so much screen time, however). <br /> <br /> "No one calls Dugan a poop!" is another line for ages. This classic movie was definitely worth the price of admission.
