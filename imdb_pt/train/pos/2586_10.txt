The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was excellently rhythmic, the pyrotechnic effects were masterfully realized, and it takes a basic story of love triangle and launches an element of science fiction in it. I was able to identify with many of the characters and their motivations made rational logical sense in the context of the story. The camera work was great, the audio clear and precise, the background music perfectly chosen for effect. the singing firefighters, an enjoyable and talented memorable singularity, brilliantly created sets and special effects performed with a skillful talent. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit confused about how a mini-carnival in the parking lot of a chain store. Much could be powered by a single light pole socket. That seems impossible to say the least. The fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch as well as interpreting the semi-serious role of a carnal very well.
