The version I saw of this movie was Blockbuster's location with a similar title, but a dirty word. <br /> <br /> This movie was funny as hell. It was also true for the bone. If you've spent some time in Hollywood or the surrounding area, you'll understand the humor. If not, you can not "get" it. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in business struggling to succeed until they finally reach a breaking point, is a rare gem. He claims it's a drama, but it's a drama, as far as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to stay well. His performance is especially impressive during the poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra but we can not have it all.
