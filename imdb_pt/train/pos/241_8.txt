I'm tired of people judging movies in their "historical accuracy." IT'S A MOVIE PEOPLE !! Writers and directors should put their own spin on history! There are a number of films out there that are not totally accurate with history .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York Gangs, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans .... all the fantastic movies that are historically imprecise. If you want to see some great actors doing what they do best then I suggest you watch this movie and do not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the plot and one of the greatest actors of our time.
