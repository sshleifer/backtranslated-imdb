It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented adolescence. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story featured a delightful 14-year-old Deanna, a small beauty with a beautiful voice, as the "Miss Fixit" in a family divided by divorce. For a summary of the plot, see other IMDb entries, but soon Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go from Switzerland to the United States to prevent their father from retreating. With an excellent cast of support, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as the sisters, good direction and editing, the film manages to captivate one even in subsequent views. Of Deanna's three songs, only "Il Bacio" is from the classic repertoire, but when she sings on the scene of the police station, the place of the film in history is guaranteed. At least it was for this spectator that at 15 years of age was injured for life with Deanna and classical music. One of the many nice touches that take place over THREE SMART GIRLS is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching his neck to a final glimpse of Deanna as the cops push him! An unfortunate result of the success of this film was that the subsequent writers of Durbin's vehicles were stuck with the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did that. Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other cinematic personalities, she replaced "naturalness" with the histrionic ability she lacked. The ploy worked well for 21 feature films.
