For real movie people, this movie is a must, as it functions as a perfect allegory for the movies themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can cause damage or can be harnessed to do good. On the one hand, blind mother, on the other hand, is used to cure blindness ("I can see!" Shouts a young girl whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff is himself poisoned by the strange power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face as a poorly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity seen in the movie (visible only, as in a movie theater, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful passage near the beginning, where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact. that everything that happens is captured in the light that flows through space for millions of years when the light of Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy, at a time when the earth was still molten rock. There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed with older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, symbolized in the sculptural figures of the local cathedral, Karloff explodes with his projector / ray gun. One has to wonder here if this film should take a look at what was happening in Germany at the time, and particularly in using the Riefenstall film the year before to promote a regime that would surely continue. do very badly: Triumph of the Will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more movies made you want to stand in the theater and shout, "I can see!"
