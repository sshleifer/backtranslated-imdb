During 1933 this film had many cuts because it was far above the top for the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to gain great wealth and power. Lily's father forced her daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill in a city with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy that brought home all kinds of male characters who were eyeing Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president. It's great to see John Wayne very young, (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily, not even for lunch. A young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) starred along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave extraordinary performances. This is a great 1933 film that was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was stuck in a flaw for many years and only recently being shown on the silver screen. This movie is fairly smooth compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this kind of movie. Appreciate
