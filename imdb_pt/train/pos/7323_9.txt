Brutal, Unemotional Michael Myers stabs his sister to death at the age of six on Halloween night in 1963; on October 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is pursued all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how bad this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bang and creates a genuinely full chiller of suspense and atmosphere that is truly superior. the many images of terror it helped inspire. It is subtle compared to the unpleasant bloodbaths that many of these subsequent films were; subtle and scary. It maintains the ability to make me jump even after repeated views. How many movies really exist that can remain scary even after being seen? Not too many. <br /> <br /> Pleasure is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature film debut, has become a true scream queen after performing on "Halloween" as well as a few subsequent images, and she is a worthy victim to cheer. <br /> <br /> Writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this film, making excellent use of dark shadows and skies; notice how much of the film is set after dark. With this photo, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that spawned seven sequels, many imitators and a new "re-imagination." <br /> <br /> It is very quoteable - who could forget Dr. The speech of Loomis (Pleasence) in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a trusted repertoire in several previous works of Carpenter)? <br /> <br /> It's fantastic and worth looking for. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It's not totally foolproof - after all, there are holes in the script - but overall it has a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
