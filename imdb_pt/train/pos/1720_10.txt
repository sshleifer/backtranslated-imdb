This short Biograph short was a lot of fun to watch. Griffith's set of DVDs "Years of Discovery" (highly recommended) features three excellent performances by the main tracks, and it is interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a The Countess's husband goes mad with his wife's betrayal and leaves her in a small room with her lover. It's kind of unbelievable that they did not hear her. but Mr. Johnson (the father of the silent player Raymond Hackett) gestures wildly and this contributes to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. When the lady collapses from shock and fear, once she realizes that she is doomed, Henry picks up her instrument and the "fans" on her.The way he did it was so unexpected and strangely sexy, and I just lost it and laugh with The expression on his face! From that moment, I was delighted with Henry B. Walthall.
