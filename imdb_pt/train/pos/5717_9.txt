Omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie I have ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be a euphemism, and I've seen hills (considering limited availability in New Zealand, that's enough), but never before did I have to sleep with the light on ... until I saw The Grudge . <br /> <br /> Some may say that it is a robbery of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both similar (though different) story lines, but Grudge remains a terrifying one. watching movie, I even screamed at some point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is great, especially the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother seems to be enjoying himself. However, while I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she does not really look like this in this movie. Of the supporting characters, hers probably has more depth and history, but she does not seem to be there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she's still the same about all her films and roles, is not she? The ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when the KaDee Strickland character picked up the phone in his apartment), the ending was also cool. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
