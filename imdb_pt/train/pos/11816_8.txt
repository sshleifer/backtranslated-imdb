This was so much fun! I've never read these Chester-Gould comics, but it's not necessary to know them. Perhaps there were some inner jokes that I did not discover, but what the eye does not see the heart can not suffer. This is such an ironic and colorful movie and the actors are all humorous together. The setup is similar to that of Batman movies, but not as dark as gray. Ok, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> With this movie, you could play an interesting game if you watch with friends. Do not watch the credits at the beginning and then see who is the fastest to find out who the famous actors are under your makeup!
