Clair Denis again revisits her theme as separate parents, men who follow their own happiness in a determined way, regardless of the emotional value of their family, but while Nénette and Boni from the previous film live in a narrow world of Marseilles, our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the Franco-Swiss border halfway around the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Again, the film starts midway, with Louis, in his 60s, dealing with a sick heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence, since his booth is the place for smuggling and shooting, a regular occurrence. Louis sleeps with a large knife underneath the pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is in no hurry to move on, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and from the few people he deals with along the border, including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable, with long hair and tuft of mustache) that rejects him as a "lunatic": shown as a dedicated father of two. There are many brief scenes that, although seemingly unrelated, construct an impression of Louis and his surroundings. Ms Godard's camera work is exciting here. The controlling metaphor is Louis's heart transplant, to which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to find another son, not found, and where Louis's new heart rejects him, just as Sidney rejected the old man. We are accustomed to brief scenes in Denis's film that are inexplicable: Nénette mounted on Boni feeding with a spoon; a trip by shooting at Boni's father and then in Boni's briefest shot with a bullet in the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant, but the body of Sidney. The implication of the latter two is a rejection, real or imagined, by a father, kills something indefinable in a child.
