Unfortunately, 8 Simple Rules for dating my teenage daughter was the last sitcom John Ritter started working on after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors of all time. He had everything, comedy (who can forget him in Three's Company), but he was also a terrific dramatic actor (Unforgiving? Worth watching TV movie) As much as I loved all the other cast members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was the star, he was much of the reason why I was drawn to the show in the first place, and it was his perfect delivery of comedy that was able to break me every time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show was not all sugary candy (as much as I loved The Cosby Show, come on, they were really cool with each other) they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly. He was realistic enough with all the rivalry between siblings and fights between parents, but they still kept it funny. Many American sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not, and this show did not do that. Yes, there were a few, such as dealing with important issues like drugs and bullying, but they did not try to be anything but a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John's death for the show was brilliantly done, I still cry like a baby every time I see him. You can feel how raw emotions were during these incredibly difficult episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that the show has been canceled, I still enjoy watching the reruns, and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always be remembered for his hilarious portrayal of this super protective father, who would rather lock his daughters in his room than have them dating a boy =) You rock Ritter !!!
