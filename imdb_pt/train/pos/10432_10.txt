I must admit that in the beginning, I was kind of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid, romantic movie about a French woman who meets an American on the train and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not really thrilled with this kind of script, as it continued to make me believe it was just a movie. Still, I watched! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dares to speak in a very philosophical way, asking about the fact that at the moment of our birth, we are condemned to death, or that it is a Medium Idea of that the fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that we humans can sometimes live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was beautifully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, at the Vienna station) - in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good way, so I began to believe that I could live a love story like this.
