If you're a fan of noir movies and you think they do not do them like they used to, here's your answer - they just do not make them in Hollywood anymore. We should turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle, and wonderful a well-made film of this genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderfully unpleasant little gift to the faithful of director Jacques Audiard, relying on sharp narratives and excellent performances by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. The basic plot might have been written in the 1940s: an ass but cute ex-convict and a smart and sloppy femme fatale (who turns out to be relentlessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of despair and nostalgic nostalgic, manipulate themselves to meet their own ends, develop complex love / hate relations criminal scheme involving assault, double crossings, phone calls and lots of money. All action takes place in depressing, decaying and / or dimly lit places. <br /> <br /> Audiard has created some modern twists, of course. The femme fatale is an undervalued office worker who happens to be almost deaf and uses her ability to read her lips to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you can expect smoldering love scenes, discover that both characters are sexually clumsy and immature. Add some modern technology and music and it looks like a contemporary movie, but make no mistake - this is the old school noir movie. It's as good as any movie of its kind and easily one of the best movies I've seen all year.
