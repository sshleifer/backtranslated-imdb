A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscar-winning performance) who is pursued by his own conscience. McLaglen plays a rouge IRA who betrays his leader to receive a reward during the Irish Sinn Fein Rebellion. The scenes that show struggles and mass actions are very realistic, focusing on the despair of individuals. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford superbly creates a hazy, tense atmosphere, highlighted by the cloudy, grimy representation of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic soundtrack enhances cinematographic pleasure. Oscar winner also for Best Screenplay, nominated for Best Picture. This is one of the Hollywood classics.
