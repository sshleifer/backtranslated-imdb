This Batman movie is not as good as the Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it's still a good installment for the Batman drawings, I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for the same reasons The plot is good not as good as the other, but still very good, there is a lot of action in it The effects of the cartoons are good The voice of the actors is really good, as Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good, like Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the Batman Mystery of the Batwomen. So, make sure you rent or buy Batman Mystery of The Batwoman, the movie because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ******* out of ********* *** out of *****
