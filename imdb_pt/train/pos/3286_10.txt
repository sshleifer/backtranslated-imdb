Simply put, this movie is terrifying. <br /> <br /> It begins simply, looking like a study of a rebellious young woman and becoming a very well-done horror film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect blood or zombies. This is psychological, and just as he would also in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you realize more about what is happening, and about how the two worlds in this movie interconnect. <br /> <br /> The drawings have never been so scary.
