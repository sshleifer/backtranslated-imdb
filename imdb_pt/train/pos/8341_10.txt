Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. This film accomplishes what all great movies seek: the creation of a world and the time we want to review and makes us happy to be part of the human race. When I am blue, this movie raises my spirit and makes me laugh (and this is still true after many visions - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All the actors are in their best shape. The characterizations are so dead and the characters combine so well that you forget the actor (usually difficult to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The supporting cast is consistently brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a whole pack of pygmies"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as "Greek choir" - "but time does not exist"), Durning ("something we can throw from NJ"), Shalhoub & Whaley (boss and co-worker Robbins at the service station), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies does Eisenhower ??). <br /> <br /> Do not lose this neglected treasure.
