People call it comedy, but when I watched it, it just laughs once. I think the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14, and I was not old enough to understand that it was not to be taken seriously. There were some scenes that were supposed to be funny, but I cared a lot about the characters to laugh at them <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you're falling in love, and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that despite some silly faults, it's one of the most touching love stories you've ever seen.
