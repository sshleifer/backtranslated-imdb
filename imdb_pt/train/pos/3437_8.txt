Some genre films need to be dressed. This was an exception. Taken on its own merit, it's a dressed version of the horror film genre. With minimal special effects, it can be a kind of psychological study, with a simple but existential theme - who gets hit by the bus and why? It's not a great movie, but because there's so little artificial about it, the story works. Subtle and all about the interactions of the characters. In fact, there is a gimmick in the opening scenes, but it may have been put there to simply set the tone of what is to come. I greatly appreciate the balance of masculine and feminine energy and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people who react to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have any empathy, appreciate the need for some adventure in your life and ask yourself "What would I do in this situation?"
