Roman Polanski is regarded as one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind such classics as "Baby Rosemary" and "Chinatown". Probably what makes Polanski's cinema very interesting is the fact that although he is able to create commercially appealing films such as the works mentioned above, he also likes to make discrete films that are more personal in nature. "Le Locataire", or "The Tenant", is one of these films; a horror / suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best work and probably among the best horror films ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski himself plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, tried to kill himself by jumping out the window. After Simone dies of the wounds, Trelkovsky begins to become obsessed by her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants of the building. Sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other "apartment-themed" films ("Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby"), this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in the head of Trelkovsky, the catastrophic effects that paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky's fall into darkness is portrayed perfectly by Polanski. Although at first his performance looks strange and woody, it is gradually discovered that Polanski acts in this way because Trelkovsky is destined to be acted in this way , like an almost lifeless simpleton, who gets trapped in this maddening underworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people: the supporting actors really gave life to the people of the building, creating memorable characters. They are very important to the success of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the beautiful cinematography that Polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation, and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for Trelkovsky. . The amazing images that Polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them scary and attractive. <br /> <br /> If a flaw can be found in the movie, it's definitely a bit slow at first. this may sound like a turn-off, but in fact the slow pace of the start works perfectly, since it mimics Trelkovsky's boring life and how it gradually enters a different realm. Moreover, the complicated plot is definitely not easy to understand due to the many complex layers it possesses. However, more than a failure, it is a joy to face such a thought-provoking plot. <br /> <br /> Although "The Tenant" may not be for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surreal stories will be pleased with the experience. "Le Locataire" is actually one of Roman Polanksi's masterpieces. 10/10
