This movie started me in a Nick Cage kick. It's a story full of twists - a film of motifs and motions. Of course Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who fell into his web. Everything about this movie is good - cinematography, rhythm of the story and, above all, the end. Cage outweighs what he does best - it's not being an action hero, but being an ordinary man trapped in life's traps.
