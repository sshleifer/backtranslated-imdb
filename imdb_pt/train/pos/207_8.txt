At first it sounded like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got in it turned out to be a really funny movie. Basically forgotten ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe and Oscar nominee and BAFTA Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner, and Golden Glove named George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and one brought back to relive his hospital sketch for a TV show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winner Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can meet again without resentment at each other, as he is wrong. They can not stay the whole time, both are forgotten, especially during the conversation, but end up doing it. Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and Space Muppets, F. Murray Abraham as Mechanic. I think the best phrase in the movie is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him "bastard bastard." He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, Set Design and Best Screenplay, Screenplay Adapted from Other Material, was nominated for BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical / Comedy, and was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!
