I've been watching "Dick Tracy" for years and as a result it has become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and I used to see it quite often. Seeing this now, as an adult, is still a very good film - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino received - besides what is rarely discussed and did not make much noise when it left. <br /> <br /> Pacino is exaggerated. top, but with good effect, as he is clearly having a lot of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a noir movie better than any movie I possibly have ever seen. Just take a look at a scene from the movie is breathtaking. The lighting, velvet and smoke / smoke tones combine to create a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some funny appearances, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I do not think there are any flaws. in everything in terms of acting - even the mandatory childish character is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very good movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7 / 10 average in IMDb. Critics' criticism is very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic strip, from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 1/5 stars.
