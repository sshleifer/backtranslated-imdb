I really love this movie, I saw last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great performance, great story, great direction / camera / music work. It's a gift to show someone you love. very bad jaco van dormael did not make any more movies after this one. Top 5 Really Work !! <br /> <br /> Today, it's 3 years and 3 days later, after the above comment. was never published because it had no more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. This is undoubtedly in my top 3 of movies along with "Cinema Paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I am very curious about the new film "jaco von dormael". I hope you complete my top 3 movie. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy. Because you'll want to see it again.
