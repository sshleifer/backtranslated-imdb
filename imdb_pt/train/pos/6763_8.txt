Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least people who can do such a thing) sit down and talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> However, some of the best films of the genre, "Out of the past", "The Killers", "In a lonely place", "Night and the City", generate an elegant level of sophistication this elevates them beyond a grumpy slogan and their connotations of threatening, stinking and femme-fatal shadows. <br /> <br /> "Where the Sidewalk Ends," a reasonably hard-to-find movie - the only copy in perhaps the best video store in Manhattan was a raw AMC cable channel bootleg - belongs to a category from as the black cloud of opening credits passes, a curtain draws around the dishonest world of lone detective Marc Dixon, and as the moments pass he comes closer and closer, threatening to suffocate. <br /> <br /> Of course, he's that "family cop with a dark past", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a dark look and a troubled intensity that makes him as uncomfortable as it sounds. And yes, he's been beating the suspects a long time, and the newly promoted boss (Karl Malden, on a typically robust tour and commander) is warning him "for the last time." <br /> <br /> However, Dixon very much hates these bad guys to stop now. And man, they had not come? "Hoods, mops, mugs, nickel gutter," he spat when that hard nut of a boss demoted him and pitched all the complaints the department received about Dixon's right hook. The advice is that it refreshes itself for its own good. But instead he takes things into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of trouble he encounters when he trusts his instincts, and falls upon a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation ago. <br /> <br /> Immediately he's at the bottom with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner. Dixon's questionable involvement in a murder "investigation" threatens his job, causes him to wonder if he is simply as basic as those he has sworn to bring. As Bogart in "Lonely Place," he can "escape from what is?" When he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers he has virtually condemned his unexpected relationship with seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) that looks as if she could turn her bachelorhood into something worth returning home. for. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this superb film is tense and exciting. The writers' group who contributed to the production improved the script - the dialogue is nimble without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or mellow. <br /> <br /> And all this high-level direction and acting is not too slippery or polite to loosen the emotional grip of the movie. Gene Tierney's angelic, gentle beauty is used to great effect. She shows herself as an actress of considerable scope, and her gentle, gentle nature is as limitless here as her psychosis in "Leave Her to Heaven." The scenes between Andrews' Tierney and Dixon become more intense and touch how much closer it seems to be self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Near the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted, Dixon sums up his fate: "Innocent people can get into terrible congestion as well," he says. "A false move and you're in your head." <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this film so attractive is the feeling that things can go wrong for almost everyone - especially for someone who is struggling to get it right - with a slight change in the wind. , a wrong decision or a punch, or, more frighteningly, due to factors over which you have no control. Noir always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the Sidewalk Ends" does it in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (A small choice of an aside: This movie otherwise has a blatantly poor dub of a blonde model that would not look out of place in the Mystery Science Theater. <br /> <br /> How strange! But Noir fans - hell, ALL movie fans - who have not seen this movie yet, are great.
