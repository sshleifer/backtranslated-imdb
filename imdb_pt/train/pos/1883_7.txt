Outstanding comedy starring Dudley Moore, backed by Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud, who speaks well. Moore is Arthur, a man from a multimillion-dollar family that was close to $ 750 million, provided he marries a multimillionaire family (Susan). In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met the beautiful and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he just had fun drinking and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before his wedding. The ending was happy for Linda and Arthur, though he knew his life would change in the near future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone's life. Rich people are generally not happy with their ways of life.
