The final ride of William Powell as Philo Vance takes place in The Kennel Murder Case, where the murder of a champion dog leads to two more murders and one attempt by the human species. It's all a question of how this leads to who and why. The assassinations of Philo Vance by SS Van Dine were more popular at the time and the clever Mr. Van Dine discovered a way to sell his books one at a time to the greatest studio competitor. That's why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out. If Bill Powell did not have a bigger fame with MGM like Nick Charles of the Thin Man series, he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same competition that the murdered dog had entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim. As usual, Powell shows Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose greatest contribution to the process was to use his body to knock down the closed door where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I said locked up from the inside and it was a top story, so I went in to find out how. Powell has a lovely bunch of suspects, as extensive as what is usually a Thin Man mystery. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, fill their roles well in the cast. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually remade it in the 1930s with James Stephenson in his career. one and only tour like Philo Vance. It is not a candle for this. <br /> <br /> As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is on VHS or DVD, by all means, see this or get it if you can.
