A must see for everyone - if you have to borrow your neighbor boy to see this. Easily one of the best animations / cartoons released a long time ago. Took the Antz movies to a whole new level. Do not confuse the two as being the same movie - although, in principle, the movie plot is similar. Just go and enjoy.
