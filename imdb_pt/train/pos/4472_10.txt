From the beginning you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a fun team! The songs they sing together are pure fun. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and very sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutest child actor I've ever seen. If you like piano, you'll be impressed with Jos√© Iturbi. This film was the first to combine animation with real actors and did this wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. Without a doubt, one of Kelly's funniest movies.
