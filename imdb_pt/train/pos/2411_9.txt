This film seems to me to be one of the most successful attempts to find plausible answers to some of the uncomfortable questions that have arisen in recent studies of the New Testament "Passion" (suffering and death of Christ) accounts. (What motivated Judas if money was not the problem?) What could the Sanhedrin bring to meet on a holy day? Why Pilate waffle?) It is a movie for the serious Christian thinking: fans of "The Passion of Christ "will no doubt be disappointed with the lack of bloody spectacle and the characterization of the bow. As for me, I think the picture painted here - the disposition of ordinary people to so cheerfully sacrifice common decency when their own interest is at stake - is much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The disinterested look, "just doing my job" on the face of the man who drives the first nail on Christ's wrist is as scary as any moment in the movie.) The film makes no claim to "authenticity", but the costumes invariably feel more "certain" than many other highly acclaimed endeavors. It's a slow movie, but if you accept your self-imposed limits (it's, after all, "Death" - not Life - "of Christ"), ultimately very gratifying.
