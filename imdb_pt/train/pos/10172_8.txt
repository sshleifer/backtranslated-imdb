"Rumors" Friz Freleng is an excellent cartoon Private Snafu that warns against spreading rumors of panic induction during the war. Produced, like all Snafu short films, to be shown to military audiences as instructive entertainment films, 'Rumors' is extremely imaginative and crammed tons of ideas into its brief life span. When Snafu begins a rumor about a bombing, it turns into a final rumor that the US has lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated through a long, rubbery piece of lies and various strange and fictitious creatures who come back to haunt Snafu with increasingly gruesome news about his country's army. 'Rumors' is inventive, quick and funny, all of which help to obfuscate the somewhat elaborate message, 'speak no evil of the military'. He stands out as one of the best of Snafu's private shorts.
