Envy is not as funny as I thought it would be initially but after some of the reviews I read I found it to be a lot funnier than people were giving props for, now it's true it's not a one minute gag movie like zoolander or burned but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as big as ever then the story is about the character of jack black inventing a spray that makes the pooh dog disappear, obviosly ben does not want to be part of it , but when the product makes rich black jack stiller ben begins to see envy, it is not great by all means and both ben stiller and black jack have funniest and best movies on his resume but if your any fan of me I recommend this as it is still a funny movie and I laughed fucking a few times as a big fan of ben stiller id I have to say that this is a little quieter but still very fun, give a watch
