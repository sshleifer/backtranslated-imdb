I being of Irish origin, I loved this movie, not only was the hot and funny guy, he was also honest and honest. I loved the girl he fell in love with too, she was beautiful. They were such a cute couple. The end was so sad. I love this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it recalls a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should watch it noble. The same young boy story falls in love with older women, older women fall in love with guys. Many paths intersect, in the end, the best decision is made or the task is completed. I have nothing more to say, without spoiling the whole movie, although I thought the French guy was ugly, less attractive to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends", this movie is so good. Quite quick, you may not have it, unless you watch "well, this is my ruined dinner". I laughed a lot
