I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I find it lovely. There is not much I can say, but the film is a well-being film, I think. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many funny phrases in the film, especially when Briggitta learns what to do and what is not in society. If you like musicals, I'd say you'd like this musical!
