I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try out cheap tricks to scare your audience like loud noises and scary kids. They usually have no originality and contain exaggerated abundance. The only horror movie I like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well done and had a great story. But he was accompanied and perhaps even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, arguably the most scary film of all time. <br /> <br /> The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to take care of a hotel while it is closed for winter. There were rumors that the place was being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will go well and he can use silence to overcome the blockade of his writer. After months of solitude and silence, however, Jack becomes grumpy and then violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that's driving you crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the scariest parts of the film is the sense of isolation Kubrick makes. The hotel is very quiet, and the rooms are huge, but always empty. It is also frighteningly quiet when Jack's son is cycling through the barren corridors. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best, scaring me and making me quit once in a while. My favorite scene is when he's talking to a ghost from inside a refrigerator. <br /> <br /> The Shining is top of horror movies in my opinion, beating the shit trash like the Ring and The Blair. Witch Project. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely a gift. 8/10
