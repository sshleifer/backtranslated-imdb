All Dogs Go To Heaven is on the same level as Watership Down for scary children's movies. Both were dark and very sinister, but at the same time the most mesmerizing experience a child can have. This was one of my favorite movies as a child. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I admit ... I had a crush on a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of the adorable cad Charlie and his partner in the crime Itchy. The story begins with Charlie escaping from the death row and going to the nearest club to do some games. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation, but as I get older, I begin to wonder why I was not disturbed by this movie when I was young. It deals with quite adult themes - gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in a world of Disney movies, it's something every kid should watch once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some kind of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the scenes from hell scare me more now than when I was little but it delivers such a poignant message that it should not be ignored by parents!
