I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon on TV in the 50s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember there was a message of hope conveyed from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the latest manic executions for impending release. I'm not sure what the squares are with the facts. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is well done. The German High Command reports ironically, without emotion "The Russians are advancing on Fredrich Strasse" as if everything went according to plan. <br /> <br /> It was my impression that this movie and a later American were on TV. off was based on the British historian Trevor-Roper's account for a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see no credit for Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree that the newest German film on the subject DOWNFALL was as well done as the classic. The American imitation was a bit flat. Few figures have attracted as much cinematic attention as Adolph. However, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have ever come out speak of Hitler's double alluded to in John Toland's magnificent historical work. <br /> <br /> Could you?
