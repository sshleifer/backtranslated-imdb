Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without anyone knowing who the other is. Of course, they work together and do not support each other. You can guess the rest. He is beautifully represented by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty and clever script and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was filmed in Hollywood, but I saw myself believing I was seeing Budapest! Everything seems so perfect and like a dream. A unique movie. Do not miss it!
