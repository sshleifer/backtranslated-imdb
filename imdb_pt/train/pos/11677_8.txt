I loved Long Way Round and was not aware of Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little 'hmm it will be so good' first episode I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great as were the other crew members. Great to see you with Ewan again. There was a bit of swearing, but that did not bother me. As for not being mentioned on the packaging. This has more to do with the bizarre certificate Excempt from Classification that the BBFC has. They should have given a 15 for the language alone. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more !!
