This was the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and happy to discover that this was one of his films too. Great job Stacy! I was kicking back at work last week, bored The * & ^% less and this movie came. Growing up in Orange County in the 1980s, I surfed back and forth on the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents would take me every weekend, I would surf, I would shake and I would leave. This movie just captivated me. It was long before my time, but it was amazing to see what these guys went through ... TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collector's item.
