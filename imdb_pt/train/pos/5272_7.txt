Deodato brings us some slightly shocking moments and a movie that does not take itself too seriously. Absolutely a classic in its own particular kind of way. This film offers a different view of the barbarians. If you have the chance to see this movie, do so. You will definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's funny or anything mundane like that, but because it's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good, though it may not be clean, fun.
