This movie is close to being my favorite piece of celluloid. There is not really much I need or want to say here. Except perhaps "Watch this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal," which takes you through this pure, funny and moving story about "spending your eighth day" - your very own day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It seems like some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Either you are enjoying a career or just consuming TV shows and ball games. What we tend to lose is the satisfaction of being something to someone else - make a difference. About having space and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least that's what I got from "The Eighth Day".
