The short that starts this movie is the actual footage of a guy named Gary, apparently was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; he is an imitator and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). And then the filmmaker receives a letter from Gary some time later, inviting him to return to Beaver to get some footage of the local talent contest he set up, including Gary's impressive performance as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The two short films that follow are the story of Gary, the one you just saw, only the first is portrayed by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover, titled "The Orkly Kid." If you feel like making fun of someone, this is definitely the movie to watch. I was almost dying to laugh for most of the time, especially the performance of Crispins, who could definitely stand on their own. When it was over, I had to rewind the movie to once again watch the real Gary and all his brilliant idiocy. Although Olivia was the focus, I would have liked to have seen one of the curious "fictional" criticize the imitation of Gary in Barry Manilow, who was equally ridiculous.
