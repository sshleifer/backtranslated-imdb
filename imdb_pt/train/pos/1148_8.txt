This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that keeps the viewer's interest always and again. Light films rarely win Oscar, but the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after seeing the movie and knowing what's coming, it's still nice to see how the various facets of the plot unfold. It is true that all drama is melodrama; but this is totally suitable for a movie with a novel background. My favorite quote comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now, why can not I write something like that?" I think it's unfortunate that the censors of the TV and the site insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.
