You spend most of this two hour movie thinking "what's the story about the main character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as a discreet "Ben Thomas" will keep him guessing. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shock ... but you knew something dramatic would be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays mysterious people, almost chasing. You know he has a good reason to do so, but it is never really explained, again, to keep us guessing until the end. <br /> <br /> All this, including a new / new, but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") may leave some viewers frustrated or want to leave this movie ... but do not do so because Final long segment joins all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two hour movie and not the typical Will Smith movie. In fact, the most shocking aspect may be seeing Smith's sad face throughout this story. He hardly looks like him in several shots. He looks like he's lost weight and he's sick. Smith does a great job portraying a man carrying a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> As a good movie usually does, this movie will leave you thinking long after the final credits.
