I have to say Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. This movie was very cute and I mean very cute. It had all the "sexual" content that most of Ivan Reitman's comedies have, but with something extra, CHEMISTRY. One and Luke have this extraordinary but believable chemistry that seems to transcend in every scene. Both seem to create this strange, distorted and interesting relationship with a powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can no longer feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the support cast seem to play each other's roles perfectly and even the small role of Wanda Sykes will keep him laughing. Although this type of comedy is not for everyone, but I have to say that I went with a person who normally does not like these movies and he was laughing like crazy. This movie certainly is not for everyone. especially the younger children, since some moments are too small ... well, let's say ADULT for younger viewers. After all, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, but the ending I found was a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
