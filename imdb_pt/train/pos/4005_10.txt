Although at one point I thought this would turn into A graduate, I have to say that Mother does a great job explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad this is a British movie because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they did, they would have ruined it for not having had time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is superb, the characters are flawed and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. And I must confess, I will always look at my mother in a different way!
