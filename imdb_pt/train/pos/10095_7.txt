My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. Never forgot. I had never seen anything so beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she did Elephant Walk.) Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings are not sexual, I just could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and look at her. She started to show her age (she's almost seventy-four), but I still believe she is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women who ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times. since then, and is a sated melodrama. What saves is, of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, magnificent landscapes, the impressive elephant's burst, and a well-made point about human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> All in all, a well-spent hours watching the movie channel or a rental video.
