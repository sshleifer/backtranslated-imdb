This is the first in the Cobaia series, and is one of the most infamous movies in the collection. It took me a long time to finally get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of movies. I bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by the release date. So I put on this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I had read on the internet, and noticing the content involved in this film, I was hoping to test my nerves with full force. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who abduct a woman and begin to torture her in the hope of discovering the human breaking point, and for how long a human can tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> It looks like a sick movie, right? Wrong. The movie does not collide. That may have happened because I've been desensitized over the years with my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that any true gorehound could get through it easily. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the individual who does not have a good knowledge of this type of film will probably become overwhelmed and disgusted by the images he sees on the screen. Although he did not shock me, the film contains scenes of violence quite evil and graphic. Including tearing of nails, bowels thrown at an unconscious woman, and a needle through the eye. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think for most gorehounds in this forum you should just get your hands on a copy of this movie for the novelty, but I suggest that for any beginner of that type of movie, you work until you reach this.
