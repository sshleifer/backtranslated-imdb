I have to say that this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked the first time, but I really enjoyed the second show, just a few weeks ago. I can see why the sequel is doing a great deal at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful palette of colors (guy, that looks good) and a good mood (but clean) for adults make it a great winner. The opening scene of 3 to 4 minutes with "Scat" is excellent as well as the subsequent interludes with it. "Sid," laziness (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main mood in the film. He usually has something funny to say throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great character of the movie, literally while Denis Leary is the fierce villain who turned well. This is not just humor and beautiful colors, but a nice and sentimental story of how a baby softens a couple of difficult characters. This is not interrupted with many songs: just a brief and there is nothing offensive in terms of language. <br /> <br /> If more animated films were so good, I would have more.
