A strange, witty and wonderful representation of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something that is funny, omen and occasionally scary! Yes, do not be fooled by the cheerful and loving melody of children; the show has a dark side and sometimes can be very cold. And that's what's so good about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom, where every character is a 2D comic device (the case with my family). Instead, the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the whole roller coaster of human emotions. The occasionally somber moments like Bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and Ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal, somber course, which help to add a bit of depth. Of course the show is also incredibly funny, and guaranteed to make you smile. It is a real shame that Eureka Video has stopped releasing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is their last hope to get hold of episodes that can not be used in stores.
