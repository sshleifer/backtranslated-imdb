The transvestite transsexual Bobbi murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of a prominent physician (Michael Caine) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute (Nancy Allen) who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is suspected of crime and joins the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to pick up the killer. <br /> <br /> This can be summed up in a nutshell: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen are great), it's very bloody - with the blood type normally reserved for splatter movies, and the boy is well-worked. Writer / director De Palma's script is good, but really lags behind the man's filmmaking skills. It is highly successful on a visceral level and I really get involved / interested in these characters. I can note the standard Palm tributes to Hitchcock's / ripoffs - at least from one of the Master's photos. <br /> <br /> And on top of that, you have a professional and compelling cast. <br /> <br /> This was De Palma's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"). <br /> <br /> By the way, actress-dancer Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants. There is a bit of trivia to you. <br /> <br /> I would not think a thriller could be sleek and bloody at the same time, but this photo takes it all. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is a musical score typically Donaggio Pinus. <br /> 8/10
