Emilio Miraglio, "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just the most perfect example of a giallo I've ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements into a sinister stew indeed. First of all, and of paramount importance to me, it has a complex, winding plot that makes sense, and the killer here does not completely leave the left field at the end. The story, about a horrible series of murders (you already know how many of the movie's title, right?) That happen in the apparent fulfillment of an ancient prophecy regarding two sisters, is engaging, and the killer, a red camouflage figure with the insane laughter of a madwoman, is at once scary and memorable. Every great giallo demands some lovely actresses, and here we have a great variety, headed by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters, and in one of her earlier roles, Sybil Danning, as a lustful slut in Barbara's fashion house. . Another necessary ingredient of a top giallo is a captivating and humble score, and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this movie that should stay with you for days. Beautiful scenery? Please check again. Shot largely in Wurzburg, Germany, the image is a treat for the eye indeed. Okay, okay, but what about the murders? After all, is not this what gialli is all about? Well, I'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well pleased with the various stabs, shootings, impalaments and other carnage that this movie serves with taste ... not to mention the crypts, the strange sequence of dreams, rats, and bats (and a lot of them too !, references to drugs, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a man of prestige to the spectators.As I said, a perfect giallo.And even better, this DVD is from the No Shame staff, and you know what that means: a lovely print and lots of extras to boot! Thanks guys!
