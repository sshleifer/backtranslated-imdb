With shame, before seeing this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research, to make sure she was not really afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was absolutely amazed by this beautiful lady. She did it flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final desires and needs of a single young woman could be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can be, when the right artists present them appropriately, as they did in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention how beautiful Carter dynamically looked in this movie. I always said that she was the most beautiful creature that ever graced the face of our land, but she seemed to have made herself in that particular movie. <br /> <br /> I hope you guys watch this movie. Enjoy as much as I do. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
