With this film, it's all about style, atmosphere and acting. True, I did not believe in all the developments in the plot, but that did not matter - the fantastic acting, the unexpected twists, and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me in, and took me along for the ride, and I had a good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but a master of the accents, and he proves this once again with a flawless Georgian accent. He is surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz, Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was impressed. I recently bought a copy of this movie, and I never tire of watching it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you skipped this movie (and probably have), then I suggest you take a look.
