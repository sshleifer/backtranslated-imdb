I just saw a press of this movie and was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that I can see all my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really liked the pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together again. I think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off the camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) the part of Bret Ratner ... Without giving much, I'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The couple of old people were very good together and you really got the impression that they spent their lives together. <br /> <br /> Both segments, Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke, packed a punch with surprises that look realistic and similar to the experiences I had in the big apple. Throughout the movie it's a great place to make an appointment ... especially if you already like the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next in the Cities of Love.
