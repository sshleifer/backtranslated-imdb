This low budget erotic thriller that has some good points but a lot worse. The plot revolves around a lawyer trying to cleanse her lover who is accused of murdering his wife. Being a soft-core film, this implies that she goes disguised in a strip club and fucks with possible suspects. As plots go for this kind of genre, not for evil. The script is good, and the story makes a lot of sense to someone at 2 in the morning, noting this not to notice many holes in the plot. But everything else in the movie looks cheap. The protagonists are not that bad, but pretty much everyone who supports them is unbelievably bad (a girl seems to be drunk and / or tall). The cinematography is dimly lit, with everything looking grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching - sex. The reason people watch these things is because of hot sex scenes that show very hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes are not hot, they are despicable, filmed in porn style, where everything is just a master photo of two people. The woman also seems like they are refuges for a pornography session. I'm not trying to be rude or evil here, but they all have that breast implant and a worn-out look. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession", sounds like a hardcore movie. Not that I have nothing against pornography - I actually love it. But I want my soft-core and my hard-core separated. What happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could act and wake you up? And what happened to B's erotic thrills like body chemistry, the Nighteyes and even stripped to kill. Of course, none of these where masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. In addition, they were pushing the envelope, going beyond Hollywood's relatively biased stance on sex, sexual obsessions, and perversions. Now they only make hard-core movies without hard-core sex.
