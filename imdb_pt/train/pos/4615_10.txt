I think people are underestimating this incredible movie. People are seeing this as a typical horror movie that is meant to scare us and keep us from getting some sleep. That was trying to do so deservedly would get a 1/10 but I saw this movie with some friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it has Stephanie beaton. This is the reason why I think it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall picture of this movie is that it has bad acting, a simple script that lasts 10 years. old could produce and that can not be taken seriously and people are sorting it down because of it. But I see it as a completely entertaining work of art ... which has a funny hilarious script that is made even more fun by the actors and although it's not very serious, it's a lot of fun.
