This cartoon (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is certainly one of the strangest subjects ever for a film: the creation in the ninth century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic narrative of this story, a pre-adolescent boy named Brendan, who lives in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a severe abbot who is preoccupied with preparing the abbey's defenses against the imminent onslaught of the feared Vikings, must enter into the surrounds forest to find the materials an illuminating master named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do this task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. Giant and delicately drawn by hand (there are some computer animations in some important passages) in a way that looks like medieval Celtic and traditional art, and with a very creative use of colors and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but it is a good strange, not the variety of put off, but the eye opening type. If someone were nitpick - plus some anachronisms, like an African monk in the 9th century in Ireland? one would have to say that the mixture of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film never really united. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. That's why I can not give them the best rating. But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film.
