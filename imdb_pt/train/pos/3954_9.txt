Whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie I've ever seen, I invariably answer "Black Noon" and to this day no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I watched alone some 30 years ago when I was 13 when my parents left for the night. As far as I know its single has already been shown once in the UK and unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> <br /> If anyone can draw a copy, please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I watched it again now would probably be a big disappointment, but it always stayed in my memory as a particularly disturbing little movie!
