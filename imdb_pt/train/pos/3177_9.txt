Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There's nothing I do not like about this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job, not only developing the main characters, but also the supporting characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to all the low budget movies out there. You do not have to spend a lot to create something worth watching. There is something to like everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. if you've ever picked on an idiot in high school. if you have ever parked anywhere in the city. If you have some kind of sense of humor, you'll love this movie. This is the kind of movie that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again, since Adam makes a bigger name for himself. I'm looking forward to Adam's future projects.
