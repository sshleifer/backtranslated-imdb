I'm impressed by Jim Carrey's work. I keep getting this movie stuck in my head. The Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying; her sweet innocence) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, the Grinch's childhood (very funny!) And, in addition, the obvious weak end with .. Christmas is not all about gifts. I have to say, I felt stupid coming out of the movies with a lot of babies and kids laughing and so on, but this movie was a good adaptation of the short film by Dr.Seuss and IS for all ages.
