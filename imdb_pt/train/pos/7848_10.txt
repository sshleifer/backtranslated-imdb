This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie or a well made movie. This is a milestone in the art of animation and even if it was not, only the technical skill that was to do it would give it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, even small props like posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this film, he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has a case with a dancing dragonfly, to the chagrin of a grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to film the adventure. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle having his own affair. Mr. Beetle pursues the lover, but he forgives his wife. The two make up and go to the movies. And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and the Dragonfly. Described thus, it seems banal, but once seen, it becomes an exciting work of cinema. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz practically invented everything that future entertainers would use in their work. For this reason, it should not remain forgotten.
