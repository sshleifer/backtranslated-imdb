I saw this as a kid in the late eighties and I must say, Galaxy Express is one of those movies that stays in your imagination for a long time. If you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this movie may be your golden ticket to the city of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Cellular animation, while somewhat traditional, features a vivid style that explosively portrays Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual narrative. <br /> <br /> This is one of those exclusive children's films like Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz, which completely transcends the status of 'family entertainment' and stands out as a movie classic on its own terms . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
