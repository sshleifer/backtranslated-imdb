Okay, like many other movies of this type, generated from an SNL box. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of making a 3-minute one-dimensional character in a moderately-viable comic-film character. He falls in a fun and consistent manner, with a reasonable frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in it, although his Lando days have long been gone, and the whole thing is filmed very well. True, it's not great art, but if you walked into Wayne's World looking for Gone With The Wind, you did something wrong. Nice for what it is
