Okay, I'll admit the cast of the movie is REALLY weird - part of it is due to the plot, but I still had a bit of trouble believing that Pierce Brosnan played that lead (although he really did a great job). <br /> <br /> It is based on a real story of an Englishman who lived with the Canadian Indians in the early twentieth century. He claimed to be an Indian of mixed blood. He was, in fact, so successful and well thought out that people came from everywhere to hear his lectures and be taken on their walks in the desert - even if he were not an Indian of mixed blood and all his knowledge was of books or forgery! The film revolves around this and what happened when the scam was revealed. <br /> <br /> The acting and the set-ups were great and I really enjoyed the movie (since I disclaimed disbelief about Brosnan). It was not widely distributed-probably because it was cerebral enough-not a Bond movie or a novel-just a really weird movie about a remarkable man.
