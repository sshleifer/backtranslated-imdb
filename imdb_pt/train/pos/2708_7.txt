After being sent to jail for not less than 10 or more than 40 years for being caught with drugs and refusing to give up on her accomplishments, Jackie (Erica Gavin of "Vixen" by Russ Meyer and "Beyond the Doll Valley "in her last film role) has to get used to life in the big house 'doll', or at least try, in this initial film by Jonathan Demme. Because of his flamboyant nature and pure prestige, I would also rate this as one of his finest films, just below "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense," but so far above any of his other films. This little classic is just fancy, sleazy and fun enough to be an unbelievably good guilty pleasure and fortunately never once goes overboard in the whole parody of the Women In Prison genre. He almost erased the rancid taste of the ridiculously "Philidelphia" from my mouth. However, the film is not without its falls (the show 'unalalent is a huge task to sit on and goes on for a long time, Barbera Steele is unfortunately wasted among other small things) But do not let those complaints stop you from watching a otherwise enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> My Note: B- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: 5 minutes of interview with Roger Corman; Biography of the cast and crew; Original Trailer; and "Candy Stripe Nurses", "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" and "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl " Rainbeaux "Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and a few others
