This is the best comedy I've ever seen! but not everyone can understand this you must be from Georgia to understand this incredible movie! :) Overall one of the best movies I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors playing very very good, but the acting of Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is to my best opinion acting in the supporting role in film history :)) in this movie playing many Georgian stars such as xvichia ipolite, serko zakariadze, sofia chiaureli, djafaridze verikoan, sesilia takaishvili, dodo abashidze .... they are all stars in Georgian cinematography :) in this film is playing great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course the director of the film Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this movie for everyone, but remember that you must meet a good Russian language to watch to this movie
