I love the TV show. It was addicted the first time I saw it. I wanted to be there acting with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with then in a turn of events that you know someone and that person is more with whom you want to be. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. Someone will get hurt, there is no way to stop it. Making the decision is difficult, but you want to remain unhappy when you could be. Why go on and live a life that you thought you wanted or thought you are doing the right thing and both are unhappy. This other person will not expect a life waiting, they have a life as well. Making the decision you really want will be better in the end. Making the best of what you have is a good thing. Money, cars, houses, etc ... do not make you happy, to have the only person with whom you really want to share.
