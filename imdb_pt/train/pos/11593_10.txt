I remembered seeing this movie when I was a child, one day in the wonderful world of Disney. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have been looking for it. I would have to say that out of all the children's films I saw back then, this one got more than all of them and after seeing it only once, I really hoped to see it again. The history and images of this film were recorded in my memory. To this day, I've never seen it since that day, in the 70's, in fact, I never remembered the title until an internet search today released to me. I loved it and I want my kids to see it. Does anyone know where I can find it?
