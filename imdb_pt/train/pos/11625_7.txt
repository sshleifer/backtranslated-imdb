-A beautiful redhead waiting for your plane meets a charming young man with whom she connects. As the two step onto the plane and sit side by side, young Jack becomes mortal when he threatens Lisa to change the room where a politician and his wife will stay, or else her father will die. See now is what happens when you fly as a coach, things like that never happen in first class. In addition to having a conflict that happens on a flight, the other thing that this movie shares with Flightplan is pure unbelief, "if that is a word of history. is to have the main character change a politician's room so he can be killed, which is a plausible plan, but will not it be easier for Jack to find someone who has computer knowledge and hacked him in the system Teenagers today can almost do anything with computers, so I'm sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change him using a computer, instead of bothering to spy on Lisa and get her to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> here and since your vo been raised occasionally it seems to me that the other passengers should have heard something. But I'm 100% sure that I'm reading a lot about it. The film claims to be as realistic as an episode of "24," so you can not be bewildered by such complexities. For all my complaints though, this is still a very fun movie that does the job. It's not exactly the kind it requires to close your brain, but at the same time it does not require great intelligence to fully enjoy. <br /> <br /> -I would love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie, but I really can not. I love Rachel McAdams, I love Cillian Murphy, and I like Brian Cox, but they do not stretch their acting muscles here. Not really a big problem, since this is not the movie that the studios expect to win several awards and the performance is not at all horrible, just not great. Wes Craven is not exactly the first to come to mind when you think of a movie like this, but it does a great job considering the time they had to shoot the movie and the lack of depth of the script. It was definitely a big improvement over the disappointing "Cursed" and as much as I liked him doing something different with this movie, I still would love him to go back to doing what he did in the past, which is a great horror movie that is spoke about decades after the release. <br /> <br /> -Anything cool about the movie that I really liked was how short the movie was. It's great to sit and watch a good movie three hours or more from time to time, but nowadays it's as if every movie that comes out feels very long where this movie seemed to have the right length. Not too long and too short. They do not waste time trying to develop the characters very much, because they know that this is not the movie for that and in doing so, they did a very good short film. Being a great movie music geek, I have to say that the best part of the film is Marco Beltrami's ultra cool score. It's great to see Beltrami go about writing the predictable things for the good music he's doing now. I really am the cool techno / orchestral type he does for major titles. Too bad I can not find the soundtrack anywhere, I would have really loved listening to the titles whenever I wanted, instead of having to appear on the DVD when I wanted to hear it. <br /> <br /> good for what it is and whiles is far from big cinema, still must provide some fun little hour and a half
