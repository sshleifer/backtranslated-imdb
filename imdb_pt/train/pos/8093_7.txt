My friend got the idea to watch the LOTR excited after seeing the Peter Jackson Return of the King. So I finally bought e-bay, thinking from the beginning that it was going to suck. In fact, it really was not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for their time, they used a unique method of mixing live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made Frodo's voice sounded a bit like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> The biggest adaptation of a book, but believe me, I've seen much worse. He skips many things, since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are packed into a two-hour movie. Definatley worth seeing, kids may like it, but still, there is no comparison to the trilogy of Peter Jackson.
