I remember watching this movie, thinking it was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was amazed at how much they could fit in a short 8 minutes. We started at a schoolyard. . Two friends are debating in skipping class. Kid B tells Kid A "Let's not go to class today". And Kid A declines, claiming he might miss something really important. Then boy B jumps and boy A goes to class. When he arrives there, the teacher informs that today they will learn the single most important lesson they will learn. They would learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she starts child A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid is not going to split, so Kid A goes to the teacher. When he finally meets her, he receives a shocking revelation about the real meaning of life. I suggest that everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it can help you for a lifetime.
