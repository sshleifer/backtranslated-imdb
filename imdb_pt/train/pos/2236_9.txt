What I remember most about this movie is that it used to air on the local KTLA TV (Ch 5) throughout the Christmas season from mid to late 70's, mainly due to the fact that the true story happened in the Christmas Eve. . It has always been a little disturbing to see the hell this girl is going through, being the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl taking leeches from her infected leg made a big impression on this young spectator. Not exactly the kind of Christmas joy I was used to seeing at the time. Definitely not a Rankin-Bass production.
