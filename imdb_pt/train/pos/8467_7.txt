I liked this movie because it basically did more with less. It could have been more interesting if they had kept the studio confined further (although some elements of the plot were more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy who played the DJ did a good job. to show someone scared and haunted by their memories. I also found his dialogue with the callers quite funny. <br /> <br /> While parts of the movie you can see a mile away, other parts you do not expect to go out the way they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very small ghost story for the most part, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes have been very well done as everything is being revealed. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter film, it seemed to be the right amount of time to tell the story. More and it would have begun to drag.
