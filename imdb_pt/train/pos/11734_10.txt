This has to be one of my favorite movies, unlike the faint "Elvira's Haunted Hills" ... anyway I love the way the movie is a gothic story / with 'Wizard of Oz' ... <br /> Elvira is a gothic Dorothy who gets stuck in an unknown town after the death of a Good Witch (elviras Auntie Morgana) ... she inherits a "Ruby" ring that is extremely powerful and sought by Maus Wizards ). .. She befriends four characters she inadvertently helps to grow throughout the movie all the time with a dog in tow. There is a show down with her uncle (the evil witch of the West), where Elvira realizes that she has the strength inside her and ends up defeating him. In the end, she is expelled by the city's inhabitants after conquering their hearts and finally arriving at her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the wizard across the country. the film ... she and her uncle both citation lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There is no place like home, there is no place like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I'll get you my beautiful, and your little dog too!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her journey that mentions the state of Kansas. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> But the fact that one of the sequences that she "ripped out, um ... I mean it was inspired by FlashDance" is pure genius ... and if you do not roll around laughing your pussy spinning at the end of your "much of the 80's" Las Vegas show, so you do not have a camp bone in your body ... This movie is a Cult / Camp Classic
