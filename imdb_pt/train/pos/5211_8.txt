Since its disgusting Disney Company divorce (with Disney retaining the Miramax brand), the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above-average movies that are little promoted and seen by few. FLOCK is a great example. <br /> <br /> A story about civil servants who have the awful job of registering registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex offenders than a whole season of Law and Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere does his best ever performance as the soft-spoken agent used by the task. Claire Danes for the first time has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she usually gets stuck) and she takes full advantage of the rookie. The cinematography, the rhythm, the editing, all of that is top notch - and I saw no camera signal of attention-deficit disorder circling around or excessive camera cuts that others were complaining about. The subject is handled in moderation, but it is still a difficult subject and can make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes shown here in abundance, which would shock even the man. tired out. Then came the decisions of the Supreme Court that simultaneously tied the hands of the police when the "rights" of sexual perverts were opened and America was turned into a shopping paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. Each of these steps was greeted with praise by the liberals, who celebrated Warren Court's evil deeds with brilliant covers on Time and Newsweek. The day-to-day liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In 2007, how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that portrays the savage violence and torture of young women - can be hired, and the surrender is subsidized by the US Post Office discount period rate. Only one part of the problem - a problem that can plague someone's family in pieces. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal, but he gives his best in his performance here. Perhaps in his mature age he has gained some wisdom.
