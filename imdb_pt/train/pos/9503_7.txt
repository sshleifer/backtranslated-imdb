a bit slow and boring, the story of an elderly man and his wife living in a dilapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the rich man smoking cigars. The photograph of the river is wonderful, as is the interior period decoration. If you like Banana Republic store decoration, this is a must.
