Having heard of Modesty Blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic book, my wife and I really enjoyed the movie. He delivered, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and his past. <br /> <br /> Although it has some elements of action, it is much more an intimate piece, excellent writing. Unfortunately, this is also where a major disadvantage of the film is revealed. An intimate piece lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half the cast is delivered. While Alexandra Staden did a great job as Modesty Blaise, her colleague Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - as the villain Miklos - did not. Grinning amid the plot as if it were a toothpaste commercial, he can not create an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the film a masterpiece. The support cast is somehow similar, from some stereotypical gangsters and sluts to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
