When we talked about Hollywood Hotel, we could be talking about one of three things, the actual hotel, the radio show and this movie that was partially inspired by the first two. Dick Powell hosted the Hollywood Hotel program on the CBS radio network, in which Louella Parsons distributed the weekly news about the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons debuted the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934 and in 1937 their share of the radio audience. Powell received, sang, and talked to Louella and her movie guests. With the power she had with her spine, she got the various stars to continue and plug in her latest movies for nothing. <br /> <br /> Then the American Federation of Radio Artists intervened and demanded that it pay salaries. accordingly and they won the case. That put an end to the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course both Powell and Louella went to other radio spots. The whole story is covered in Tony Thomas's book, The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the take was taken, the film left Powell's Warner Brothers home studio inspired by the radio show. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the band Benny Goodman, who is hired for a Hollywood contract. But when he leaves for Hollywood, he finds himself involved with a selfish movie star, Lola Lane, his real twin sister Rosemary Lane, and an amateur actor in Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in a Civil War epic he's doing with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. Then Mowbray develops a problem for Lina Lamont when she is invited to go to the radio program of the Hollywood Hotel, broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel. This leaves the studio in a state of confusion. Let's say the problem is not solved as it is Singing In The Rain, but Powell's manager, Ted Healy, proves to be resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer offer a great score for the film. The great success comes early on, when Benny Goodman's band, with Johnny Davis singing, sings the Hollywood anthem, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite however is Powell and Rosemary Lane singing, I'm like a fish out of water. Just listening to Johnny Mercer's lyrics about Ginger Rogers driving the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without his fan is a compendium of American popular culture in the 1930s. Busby Berkeley does the choreography here and while the movie no Do not have the imaginary material that your previous work with Warner Brothers has, the numbers are well staged. The big moment for Berkeley is at a drive-in restaurant, where Powell and Healy were forced to take jobs. The number starts with Benny Goodman's broadcast of the Hollywood Hotel making Let That Be A Lesson To You and then on the drive-in Powell, Lane and the whole place begin to join in music to the exasperation of owner Edgar Kennedy . And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's exasperation. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman manages to show why he was named King Of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xilophonist Lionel Hampton are part of their group. This along with Frances Langford singing as well. And possibly the last member of the surviving cast of the group was a guy who had a bit of a radio talk. He died in 2004, but not before becoming the 40th president of the United States. Ronald Reagan has always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two Warner Brothers guys who were the most helpful to a young eager player who wanted to make his mark. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is a charming and fun person. movie, dated, but charmingly so.
