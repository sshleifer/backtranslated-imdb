This is a Warner Brothers movie with very young Barbara Stanwyck. A consummate master at portraying cool Maiavellian, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity," Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a sweltering steel town. She became cynical and numb for years being offered as a sexual favor to her father's clients. Once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she skips a freight train to New York and literally sleeps up the corporate ladder of a bank. <br /> <br /> That would seem absurd if it were not for Stanwyck's blazing fire. I work here. With his dead eyes and methods of amoral seduction, it is easy to see why men become addicted to their aggressive carnality. One of the guys she seduces along the way is John Wayne's cool face, of all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama is heavy for the last third of the movie with a murder-suicide, a secret job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new president of the bank who is so addicted to Lily that he appropriates funds from the company to keep her in luxury . A complicated ending is a bit disappointing, but not before Stanwyck burns the screen. The film has curious touches such as Lily's friendship with an African American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
