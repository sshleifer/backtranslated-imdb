........... as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie but because it scared me a lot! Like I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show us; The reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were terrified when the Woman in Black came out the window and floated on Kidd's bed, though, just before there was something that also startled us, that was when Kidd found the toy soldier underneath his pillow, and he hears a child's voice say "it's for you". This scene still haunts me to this day, almost 7 YEARS after I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're easily scared, AVOID THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!
