Throughout this movie, you may think that this movie is just for kids. Well, it's mainly aimed at them, but it's also well rounded enough with the jokes pointed out also to the adults in the audience. This time, the Muppets gang tries to get on Broadway, with the difficulties of stopping them from being produced, causing them to separate. But Caco will not stop, and his determination keeps things moving until after getting the agreement together, he is run over by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> <br /> It is reminiscent, in part, of those old cars starring in the 1940s, with musicals, actually, as the theme of a musical, but here there is a lot of zaniness and wonderful moments played in a Bowl. of hysterically funny moments (the boomerang fish of Lou Zealand, the Gonzo water show, the whispering campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. The Muppet writers are not shy with the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point of being almost refreshing to see a "let's put on a show" story where, through thick and thoughtful, the characters will find their dream . <br /> <br /> Although not as original in scope as Muppet Movie, it has many captivating and memorable songs, great locations in Manhattan and even some intonations of species (and marriage) encounters! Cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?"), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (proposed by a mouse), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing along, or just have lots of laughter and romantic moments (yes, romantic) with one of the best Muppets movies.
