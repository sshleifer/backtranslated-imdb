Although the story is fictitious, it is based on the reality not only of the history of Latin American countries, but of the whole third world. This is the true, raw and crude recent history of these countries summarized in a concise manner in this novel / movie. Unusual supernatural material eliminates the intensity of the historical events featured in this film. After all, supernatural material is part of Third World culture. Although not critically acclaimed (probably because of supernatural material), this is an excellent film, with a great story and great acting.
