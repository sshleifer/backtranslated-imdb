I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store when. I've always been a big fan of Weird Al and when I saw this video I rented and watched. I was too young to enjoy all the subtle humor and satire of Al at the time, but I remember that much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a fan of "Al", especially from your previous job, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's done in MTV's "Rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al got where he was in 1985. You'll love it if you like his mood mark and, most important, his song.
