....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was very wide and a scream. I love watching him interact with Amanda Blake, or with Don Knotts or whoever he is - he was clearly having a ball and I think he made it so much easier for his guests - as long as they knew in advance that he was not a disciplined, of production. Relaxing and getting loose was clearly the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of men like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis too. Great timing, old jokes that kept the audience in stitches for decades, sheer enjoyment of what he was doing. His sad clown that he played was good too - but in a touching way. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think he's great, having just bought a DVD of his shows from 1961. Things in a fond way for me. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of his season when he was closing the show in 1971. <br /> <br /> Make sure you're a fan or curious. He was a riot.
