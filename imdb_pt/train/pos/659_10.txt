One of the last classics of the French New Wave. For guidance, the filmmaker Jean Eustache took from the simplicity of the cinema of the beginning of the century; for the story, Eustache relied on the torments of her own complicated love life. So many things can be said about this film - observationally brilliant; self indulgently overlong; occasionally hilarious; emotionally draining ... etc. In my opinion, any complaints that might be raised against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths. Every movie student, writer, or simply anyone who is willing to deal with a 3-hour movie without abrupt cuts, no overstyling of video clips, no twists in soap operas, and no banal dialogue should make a point of watching that movie. Everything is to be admired: writing (concise, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (all are simply perfect in their respective roles), and in a simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film) does this unforgettable movie. This is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
