For his first premiere, this movie has some heartwarming and creepy moments. In the best horror movie form, the mouth of your stomach tightens every moment during this movie. The ending is superb. The creators of Blaire Witch obviously watched this movie that is ending was not an end but a beginning of the end. A great movie and only a piece of Japan is great in that it frightens a perfect score that makes you think and be afraid of your mind.
