I did not like the Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I did not watch your other movies. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is well done. Seems real. As Satya from RGV did. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of so-called high society is the movie's summary. In the midst of all illness, it is difficult to lead a normal life that the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to be seen with kids or wives. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place to report the activities going on in the parties of the rich and the elite that deliver much more dirt than what is reported. As this page-3 is also a business perspective is shown in the film. Event management companies are paid to organize parties and make people rich but not famous, famous overnight, by clicking on photographs with the celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has penetrated deeply into the high society of Mumabi. . The film shows this boldly, without restrictions. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
