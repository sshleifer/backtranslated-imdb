This is one to watch a few times. The excellent writing shows that they had to have lived through this story or met someone who did because they preached it. Freebird made me relive and laugh at my wasted youth. The title was a great choice. Great movie, scenery, history, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker movie, but it would be a shame to break up like this. Funny to the bone, a bit like the Trailer Park Boys in the UK. If you've never seen the TPB, make sure you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Sequela? It could be done. There is so much more of the world that I would like to see through their eyes.
