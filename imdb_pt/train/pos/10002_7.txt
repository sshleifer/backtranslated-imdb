This is easily the most underrated movie inn in the Brooks canyon. Of course, it's flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of the lounge singers, or the Titanic gave a realistic view of the Italians YOU IDIOT). Many of the jokes are insignificant. But still, this movie is very kind in a way that many comedies are not, and doing so in a story about some of the most traditionally-insulted members of society is really impressive. He's not the Fisher King, but he's not crap either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have chosen someone else in the lead (I love Mel as a director and screenwriter, not as much as a leader).
