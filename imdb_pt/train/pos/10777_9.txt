Radiofrequency is a movie about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It's a brilliant film where a group of friends like us all live the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The film does not take a happy or sad approach to things, it just tells us a story that we all could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sadness. The power of this story is that we grew to love the characters, it is one of those movies that you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the small town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to finally walk the streets alongside Freccia and her friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry sometimes, it will shock and comfort you, it will give you and take from you. Personally, I believe you have played an important role in my life and in my friends, and I suggest that all of you watch and let it become a part of you.
