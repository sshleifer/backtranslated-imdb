I read Kerching's comments on IMDb and, frankly, I have not seen a positive review so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenager named Taj Lewis in order to make Â£ 1,000,000 for his mother, he creates a website called rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things, if only the Taj, and his 2 friends - Danny and Seymour can prevent the Taj from being exposed. I find this show very funny and I like watching it. The acting is O.K., but definitely can be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes him funny. and Taj's other friend, Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the cafe, was called "The Chill." We never see him, we just listen to him. Taj's younger brother, Omar, and his older sister, Missy, are also funny. And Missy's best friend, Kareesha. So often the Taj was nearly exposed, almost. In addition to comedy, the drama in Kerching, such as love life and the loss of loved ones, makes this program terrific.
