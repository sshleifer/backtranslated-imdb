On October 24, 1955, the hard-working geologist of the Hadley Oil Company Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) meets with executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of his boss Bill Ryan in New York and invites her to a conference. with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confesses that he traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the wish of the reckless Kyle, who has been his best friend since childhood, to eat a club sandwich and the meeting was just a pretext. for Kyle's father, Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle uses his unsuccessful money to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco and the unsure Kyle to drink. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easygoing woman and has an unrequited passion for Mitch, who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and may be barren and starts drinking again. The jealous Marylee poisons Kyle by saying that his wife and Mitch are having a love affair. When Lucy discovers that she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby belongs to Mitch and his distrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is a melodramatic super-novel, with characters and artificial situations. There are at least two major feature-length drinking films: "The Lost Weekend" (1945), with an impressive performance by Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with an impressive performance by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and the motives of his character to drink are shallow and clich√©s. In the end, the forgettable "Written on the Wind" is just fun and never a feature to be nominated for an Oscar. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Words to the Wind" ("Words to the Wind")
