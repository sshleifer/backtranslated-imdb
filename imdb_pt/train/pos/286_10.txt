I read many commits when I was in theaters and they were all bad ... I think you have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who likes the Waltons or Little House ... U will not understand or appreciate these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now, about the joy of loving ... I knew he was a bad news the beginning of the movie ... I wish it had shown more of the end instead of letting you think. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff ... it's 6 years later, so you know he'll be interested in girls. <br /> <br /> I mean I've enjoyed all 4 movies so far. ... I was not crazy about the books ... I can not wait until the next movie. The way Clark talks will get you every time. I'd love to see January Jones make an appearance ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
