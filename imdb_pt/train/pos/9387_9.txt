As others have commented, I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert listed it as one of the top 10 films of the year. What a gift. So I went out to buy, just to borrow. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on top of his cab. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I frightened you." Yoakum puts the pistol on Cage's face with "Looks like I'm scared?" A little humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> There really was a sense of fun in it. The constant sighting of the "Welcome to Red Rock" signal causes a moan and a smiling head-shake. The song created a scary quality for the movie that resembled "Twin Peaks". Unlike "Twin Peaks", however, it does not spoil things by going too far for the stranger, needing to "get over". <br /> <br /> I admit to seeing the credits 15-20 times. You see, they had Yoakum's "Thousand Miles of Nothing" (perfectly chosen), playing like a freight train bent around the desert floor. . with snow capped mountains in the distance. That was amazing, framing fluid. Also, I have never seen a better unification of vision and sound in the film. In addition, it fits totally into the story.
