I was absolutely mesmerized by this series from the moment Tom Long stepped in - the whole bad boy thing, it was just addictive. <br /> <br /> History has left you hooked, what will happen next? get the girl at the end, after 5 years in prison, and all this time thinking about his lost love, crossing paths with her again, discovering that he has a son ... Although he is a violent villain, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> A truly captivating parter - please show it on video!
