While movie titles contain the word "Mother," the first thing that comes to mind is the love of a mother for her children. <br /> <br /> However, Mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifices herself for the benefit of her child. Here the director of Notting Hill, Roger Michell, tells us how a mother's love for a man half her age harms the people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond, he plays Darren, a man who is helping to reform his mother's house and sleep with his daughter too. Anne Reid, who was a familiar face in TV series, takes on the role of challenge of the main character, May. The story begins with May deal with the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, in a family visit to his son, Bobby. While she befriends Darren, a handyman who is doing some renovations at Bobby's house, she was shocked to find that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May was dealing with the afterlife of Toots. Fearing that Harry and Paula did not want her, May begins to feel that her life is leaving, until she spends her afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was friendly and friendly with May, and May soon finds some affection in Darren. Instead of treating him as a friend, she treated the man who was about half his age with the love of a couple. Later, May found sexual pleasure in Darren, where he gave her the pleasure she would never find in anyone else. And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the collapse of a family. <br /> <br /> The mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and comfort someone who is there for her. This can be said from may buy tea time snacks for Darren to meet the sexual needs of a man younger than her where eventually gave her more than she expected. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid made a breakthrough for her. May role, as she was previously best known for her various role TV series. As she does not have many movies on her career resume, The Mother caught the eye of the critic. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, took a similar role in his film career, as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his relentless role of James Bond fails, film critics must not forget that he has performed better in small productions in his film career years, and his mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> Mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it's definitely not your usual matinee show to accompany tea and cookies, accompanied by butter and jam.
