Of course, by any standard movie review standard, Soldier is a very poor film. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier created from birth to kill but later became obsolete after being overtaken by a bunch of super soldiers in a rick hoop rick that looks a bit like a gladiators contest without the mats. <br /> <br /> Abandoned on a garbage planet, he is aided by a community of hippies of naff space who teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. Kurt does not talk much. Finally the really super soldiers appear and kill the hippies firing on their backs as they are fleeing. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is totaled. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy starts a new category for "Best Explosion", the Soldier will not win any awards. However ridiculous it may be, it remains a pleasant experience. Military equipment is the coolest since Aliens (especially the APC) and at 90 minutes it is not well received. Please note that the mark below is just a guide. Drop five points if you intend to take it seriously and cash another one if you do not like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
