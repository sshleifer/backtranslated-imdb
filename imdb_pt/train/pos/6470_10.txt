This is one of the greatest of all time "Our Gang". Spanky is the most cute and funny, and the babies he earns to care for are also hilarious. Tiny Spanky is coerced by the gang to see all his little brothers. The opening scene of everyone in baby strollers, being entertained by various things hanging from the gang of fishing rods, is a beautiful joke. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Spanky using her huge toy knife when asked to be babysat by her older companions. is invaluable, as is your response - "Hey, where do you get these things - I do not take care of babies!" The little fellow saying "remarkable" throughout the film, all the beautiful visual gags and Spanky telling the babies "all about Tarzan" add up to make this one of the best "Our Gang" you'll see.
