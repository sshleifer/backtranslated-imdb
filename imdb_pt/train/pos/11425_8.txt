The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it's much more than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who grew up in the South would experience the same things. One yearning for another, another of a different race, which can not be consummated. Even a look is forbidden. There are no necessary words. Your facial expressions say it all. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture themselves because they can not have each other. <br /> <br /> The girl, Cécile Ducasse, is lonely and spends all her time with Protée. She really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most annoying aspects of the film is the laziness of the settlers. They can not even undress to sleep alone. The world is about to end; they just do not know yet. Your racist attitudes will be erased with your presence. <br /> <br /> I think I'd like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you only hear the animals.
