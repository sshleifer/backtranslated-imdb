I can not believe that others have such a serious view of it all. God, it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the Western series of years ago. It was not meant to be a great movie experience, except that it was. So what if there was not a great bonanza of special effects? It was fun, tongue in cheek, to look at the old west. Dude, relax and enjoy.
