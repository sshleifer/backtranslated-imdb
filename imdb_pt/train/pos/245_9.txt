The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. Not bad, but not very good. Editing is good; the film is very rhythmic The management is competent and guaranteed. The story is painful. The film is moderately represented by Ledger, Bloom and the normally great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you're from the US, so just relax and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). By the end of the movie, I was neither bored nor moved. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say, I do not care about that. <br/> <br/> Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom kind of shows some clues to reach (although this "I'm pretty and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls might find it worth it Worth the price of matinee. Other than that, I just do not see it. It's neither good nor bad enough to be fun.
