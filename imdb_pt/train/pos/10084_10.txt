This spectacular movie is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen. It shows a China that I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely painful in so many situations to see how difficult life was for the characters, yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You really see the depths and heights of human existence in this movie. The actors are all perfect, in such a way that you feel you really have entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I just can not recommend this movie highly enough. You can only change it forever after you have seen it.
