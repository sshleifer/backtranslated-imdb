The way the film is narrated: humanity and love developing slowly between these two strangers, and contrasting with the continuous and simultaneous inhuman pace of the fascist radioist (who happens to be a colleague from Mastroianni) and the adepts and for the show. "For me, this is a very good film about what it is to be human." Perhaps some of you argue that the antifascist "message" is very clear, but to me that did not destroy the movie at all. vote is 10/10.
