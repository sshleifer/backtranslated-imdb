I would say it's time, this movie was incredible ... and yes, if you do not feel like becoming a Christian, then why bother to watch. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it very exciting. I see now that they have taken these films to another level and created the Left Behind series ... they make a comparison and they are definitely more modern to reach people. I think to really judge this movie, you should see ... there are 3 or 4 of them in the series, if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie for yourself! ! God will bless you if that is why you are watching them.
