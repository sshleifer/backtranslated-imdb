Three despicable ones get their deserts just after wasting their lives on greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me think where reality ceases to exist and the imagination takes control. Even though these people were the scum of the earth, I still felt sorry for them. They never had much chance.
