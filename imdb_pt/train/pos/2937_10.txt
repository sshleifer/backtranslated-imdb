I know it's rude, and I know it's not at all PC, but it's so funny. If you can put that into perspective, it's from the early 80's and carries all the stereotypes of the time - and the movie still makes you almost faint from laughing - at what really is a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your politically correct for an hour and a half, just to have a total laugh, then please note that. <br /> <br /> Q. Could anyone put it on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
