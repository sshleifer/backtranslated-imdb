"Show People" is an absolutely delightful silence directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What the two jewels are in this lovely comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is Savannah's conversation trying to make it on the big screen. Although she is a success in the comedy, what she wants to do is to make "art", so she moves to High Arts Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the tastes of her friend Billy. Many stars of the silent-movie era attended "Show People," including Davies herself, with no curly hair and makeup. I'm sure that when people saw the movie in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; unfortunately, nowadays, this is not the case, even for moviegoers. In one part of the film, however, she meets Charlie Chaplin; in another, the author Elinor Glyn is pointed at her, and Vidor himself plays a special role at the end of the film. Other stars appearing in "Show People" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Ren√©e Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. <br /> <br /> Davies was adorable and a lively comedian. It's a shame that William Haines has given up on the movies - he was cute and full of energy, deservedly a huge star in the past. <br /> <br /> "Show People" is a simple story told in a witty way. It is also a retrospective of an exciting time in Hollywood history and contains performances of two wonderful stars.
