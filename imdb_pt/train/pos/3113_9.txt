The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best ever role), the block's newest espionage boy, ends his quest for identity, while seeking to end the CIA's latest "Blackbriar" program for make super killers like himself. <br /> <br /> I was so excited by this that I saw your predecessors yesterday and today. The identity was as brilliant as I remember and Supremacy continues to be the weak (but still nice) link in the chain to the weaker plot and in addition to a chase of cars that the pursuit of the film easily leads, lack of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, Ultimatum has suspense! Even when you know that Bourne is going to escape the authorities (and the kid makes those movies calling the police inept), it's still brilliant to see him do it. It's mind-boggling to think that two guys with pistols and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything the giant $ 150 million robots did on Transformers. Chalk with Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of filming himself in the documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like the CIA's headquarters, where no one inside 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. He seemed to hear my various grievances with Supremacy, since the action on Ultimatum is nothing short of inspiring, with various instruments used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (I will never look at them again in the same way) and an electric fan (do not ask). The song also helped generate a lot of suspense, and there was hardly a time to not be bitten. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles's character, Nicky, has put her situation on the scene. a new light highly sympathetic. Damon plays his signature role with reserve, but competence (which sounds smaller but that genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something) but remarkable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. This yearning for a real life could be boring, and almost did it in Supremacy, but only works better in the Ultimatum (best script). <br /> <br /> I remember a scene in "Goldeneye" (Pierce Brosnan Bond's only good movie) in which the character of Sean Bean asks James if the martinis silenced the screams of all the men he killed Bourne laments all the people he killed and considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of purposeless action, meaningless living, and how government has turned men into resources. Although resources that know the Krav Maga and that can make weapons with anything. Sidenote: It always bothered me that despite being over-pursued and hunted by the CIA, Interpol and the police almost anywhere he goes. that Bourne never thought of making even the slightest attempts to disguise his features or forge new passports. Maybe sunglasses? <br /> <br /> If you have a wrestling action movie and love, the Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action movie to come out this year. Of course, you would be an idiot to see this without seeing others first. It kind of drags a touch near the end, but I'm almost tempted to ignore it. This is the first movie "3" this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something. <br /> <br />
