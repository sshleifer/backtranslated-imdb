I liked this movie and I had very low expectation due to all the negative comments I read before going. I went because I was curious about the reason for all this hype, because some of the posts were so annoyed with this movie and the Koreans. Oh, and it's from Korea, which posted some of my favorite movies. I liked Host, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite science fiction / fantasy movies so you can get a taste of my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It was not confusing as everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some holes in the story, but it really does not matter. I kind of shied away from things like that and stopped asking myself why I was a long time ago when I see summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the material of reincarnation was different, and I felt that the main characters dressed suspiciously like Korean actors at other shows. Ethan's hair (Behr) looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better and I hope that in the future, Korea, with its peculiar sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, can bring diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
