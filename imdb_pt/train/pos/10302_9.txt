This movie is the best movie Jim Carrey ever made. Carrey did not have his usual face doing things in this movie. He was funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God descends from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. Like I said before, Carrey did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as an actor / supporting actress. The plot was good because it had many subpoints at the main point. This movie can be funny (Bruce's dog) as well as sad (the "break-up"). The script worked well, too. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
