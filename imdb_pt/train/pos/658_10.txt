It's not an easy movie to watch - it's over three and a half hours long and consists entirely of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly convincing and relentlessly observational of human character that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see the fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating by Jacques Rivette, which was made around the same time). This shows that the idealism of the late 1960s is no different from the society it was trying to change. <br /> <br /> It involves a supposedly released ménage-à-trois between Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud). Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Françoise Lebrun). However, Alexander is as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. Women are exposed as willingly subservient and define their femininity through the male gaze. <br /> <br /> The film is an extremely chilled end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the main actors of New Wave, having acted (among other films) in the influential Francois Truffaut's Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other New Wave directors, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike John Cassavetes's similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film resonates with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Françoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the person from the real life in which the character Marie was based on also did. Anger and bitterness culminate in a harrowing monologue of Veronika delivered directly to the public, breaking the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This mesmerizing, personal and honest cinematic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.
