This is a superb self-sufficient job that is disconnected from anything before or after. Brat Pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice, but in this world free of law they make a seductive environment. The film is packed with Our Guys, distinguished actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances. Dialogue is a joy. In fact, it is a new vernacular. One of the few movies that can be watched over and over with deep appreciation. <br /> <br /> Highlights include British elegance by Billy Idol, Ben London's vulturino brassware, Kyle's oblivion, and ad hoc philosophies research.
