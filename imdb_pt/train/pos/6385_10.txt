This movie was great! It was an excellent interpretation of an ancient myth. The animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without a corner. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for the Disney staff. Some of the characters were a bit square, but they were more than offset by the beauty and exuberance of the setting. The song was largely instrumental, but it was perfect for the movie. It was definitely not a movie that needed the characters to be sung. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
