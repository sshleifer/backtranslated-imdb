After reviewing this intense martial arts film for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that it has lost none of its mysticism, nor any of its martial arts actions as I had remembered since my youth. The story of a moribund martial arts instructor sending his "unfinished" pupil to meet the 5 members of his Poison Clan's past, so they do not seek a fortune that the master's friend hides. Fearful that his last student does not have enough training, he instructs him to befriend one of the five "poisons" in order to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about the choreography or the camera work. A good movie in its own right and one of the best martial arts films of all time. ONE CLASSIC!!
