I always look forward to this movie when it's on TV. I have to get the DVD, I guess. The range of different types of people is great. It tells me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so peculiar, but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with a wonderful dance. Unfortunately we never get a chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make the perfect sequence if they had. But I think this leaves your imagination to what could happen. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I did not see the remake of Hollywood. I'm not sure I want to. I do not really like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere combines more with the original than Lopez. I have the feeling that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
