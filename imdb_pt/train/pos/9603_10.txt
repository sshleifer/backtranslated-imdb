I have a word for this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. The people in the theater were crying. This film shows the difficulties that Darius suffers with Muscular Dystrophy. The film was very well done and really made you part of the film, I was so thrilled with the movie because it reminded us that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less fortunate than us. And sometimes we should give them one and help them to the end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius one when they were not solicited, they did not do it for the money they made for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
