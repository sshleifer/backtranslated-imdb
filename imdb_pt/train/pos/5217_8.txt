I got this movie late at night on the cable, and was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason why this film was no longer known, is because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the subject of sexual abuse, it is a well-acted, suspenseful and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not for the faint of heart, the film is not brutal either (like 8mm, for example). <br /> <br /> I recommend for those who like serial killer and suspense type movies.
