Being that this movie has many entertainment qualities, I think I should have some more credit than what was given in imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your basics 'who did it?' thriller with sex and murder but keeps you guessing until the end. I like these types of movies and I certainly think this meets the standard. <br /> <br /> For me, it was worth watching more than once, so I'll give an 8 on imdb.
