I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a kid and I was glad to see that a movie had been made about the book. <br /> <br /> I was a boy of a boy and a girl of 11 and 8 years and I had to talk to the girl to see the movie. But fortunately in the end she was happy she saw it and even said she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. There were some great moments of laughter and the movie was not as "rough" as I'd hoped it was ... although it did look good in the brute ... The only thing I can not figure out that's why they had to have the "dilly" line there that was made by Woody in reference to his private part ... which to me was the only shocking moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience choking audibly at that moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why this was put into the film; did not add anything to the actual movie except for the shock / sigh factor ... in addition, a very good movie. Good to see the girl "Pepsi" all grown up.
