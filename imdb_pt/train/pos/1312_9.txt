Trace this in the Victory column, this was an excellent movie. The performances were great and the script was equally great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was magnificent as Riverside police officer Gina Pulasky. Ginny was a complex character. She was a new police officer from the Riverside Police Department. She ended up in an affair with a co-worker she knew had a wife and children, all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to get a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (the similar Ray Liotta) did a job as the confusing, often stuttering, cop who had an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extramarital affair. Steven Weber, most notably from the "Wings" sitcom, did a good job as the quiet, meek and weak sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface a cold-hearted killer lied. Weber actually took on the character of a young adult child with an insatiable thirst for killing boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, each verbal exchange lets us know more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with days of condensation, if not weeks of events in a 90 minute movie. This movie was a good example of doing too much with too little.
