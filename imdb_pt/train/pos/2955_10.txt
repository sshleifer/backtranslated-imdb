There is a certain fascination I have always encountered in the discovery of the great (semi-) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" video in a junk shop, mixed with countless dozens of variable quality tapes. Of course, this is the only place I would find, since it is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> While I watched Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the film, I was certain that I was witnessing a great performance undiscovered. Yes, I had seen Davis in several small parts - and a lead role in "A Passage to India". But although she has been superb in the above-mentioned movie, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since I recently watched Gillian Armstrong's later film, "Charlotte Gray," I was well aware of the kind of actress that impresses her. Davis attracts much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensibility. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis's performance is impressive, I can not say enough good things about it. She shares an incredible on-screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), another great actress in the film. There is much drama and quiet humanity they share together, details of which I do not intend to reveal here (see for you!). There are very good in "High Tide" to cover in a review. In fact, I would hardly care - the film speaks well enough for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise screenwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors and the great Russell Boyd for her brilliant and unobtrusive cinematography (please see her work on "Tender Mercies").
