I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to your bravado and courage. What a pair. What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. This is not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. It's kind of a history lesson and a documentary in one and combined with a fun cinematic biography. The acting was superior by all included and we really got a glimpse of the difficulties that these two sisters have gone through for many years. Both sisters are very different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family, with high, perhaps even impossible standards of perfection. Sad to see Sadie's father refused to allow her daughter to continue seeing her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I completely recommend this movie and I'm glad I caught it on television the other day.
