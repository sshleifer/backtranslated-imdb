Alain Delon visits fast and secure revenge against the relentless criminal family that employed him as a murderer in Duccio Tessari's "Big Guns" thriller after accidentally killing his wife and son. Tessari and scenarists Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore from "One Minute to Pray, One Second to Die", and Franco Verucci from "Ring of Death" take this actioneer on a career sniper to the mafia to the wire. In fact, "Big Guns" is fairly predictable, but still qualifies as a solid entertainment with many wild and often sudden killings. Alain Delon of The Godson is aptly laconic in methodically treating the death of the heads of Mafia families who refused to let him retire so he could enjoy life with his son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the ax with the character Delon, but the rest of his hard-nosed colleagues want the dead killer. Like most police films in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" signs the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Curiously, the only man who has nothing to do with the murder of the hero's wife and son survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari does not waste a second on this 90-minute video. In addition to the mother and son dying in a car bomb intended for the father, the worst thing that occurs occurs in an automobile salvage yard when a partner of the hero is crushed in a junked car. Ostensibly, "Big Guns" is a bloodless ride but has a high body count for a maverick melodrama from 1973. Only at the last minute does our protagonist lower his guard and thus the artificial morality of an eye for an eye remains intact. Tessari stages a good number of car chases and the death of a don on a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn. The photography and the compositions are excellent.
