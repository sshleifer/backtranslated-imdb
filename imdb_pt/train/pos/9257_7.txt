This is your typical woman in navy chains love story transportation? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works so far, a beautiful woman is introduced to a photo, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows some typical story lines, but that does not say anything about the content. There are big scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, although short. Some things did not make sense, like the need to get into random fights, but it's fun to watch, the fights were really well done. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a comedy most of all, but it has a very good feel. The mood is well-balanced, you will not hurt your stomach with this, but you will maintain a smile. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of steaming action, so it's not for kids.
