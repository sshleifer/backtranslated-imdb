I first heard about this movie after buying the 1976 movie "Snuff". I was told that the Devil's Experiment was much better, so naturally I went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had tried to ban this movie or the second, so my interest was hit. <br /> <br /> The Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. . Only 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways, such as beating her, turning her in circles again and again, forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to hear the screaming noise for 24 hours, smashing her hand with a hammer, burning and placing worms on the burns, throwing courage at her, and finally pushing a sharp needle through her eyes. <br /> <br /> I must say that much of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes. But then some of them were really well done, in regards to extrapolating you. The scenes in which the woman is being turned in circles were making me dizzy watching. Or the scene where she is forced to hear a sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I did not shutter it when I watched it, but I just thought "Damn, this looks pretty good for such a low budget movie". I liked the movie, but I do not know if I can really recommend it, unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
