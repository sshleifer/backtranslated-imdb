Recently, I found a copy for $ 5 at a video store and recorded it eagerly. While the music and (obviously) graphics are not up to my favorite series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I'm still delighted with a segment: Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ice." The music is brilliant and the emotions seem real. The clip on Odyssey's website does not have history or music, unfortunately.
