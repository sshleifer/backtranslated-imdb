Unfortunately, because of the tendency of American viewers to avoid subtitles, this film has not received the distribution or attention it deserves. His subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations, and especially how colonialism harms all parties, transcend the obvious dramatic tensions, nostalgic memories of the protégé's childhood, and the exoticism of his relationship with his parents' houseboy, perhaps the only one "true" human she knows. Let's not even look at his mother's relationship with this elegant man. Over there! I hope I have given you a enough hook to accept, be it French or legend or not. I challenge you to be as brave, strong, and conscientious as La P'tite.
