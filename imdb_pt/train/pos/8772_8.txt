Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the 1940s and years before that. And I mean that in a positive way, since I'm definitely not an enemy of the Bay. His films are just high quality entertainment, just as Raoul Walsh's films were in his day. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is high quality entertainment. In addition to a first-class director, he also has a first-rate cast, with regular Raoul Walsh leader Errol Flynn in the main part. <br /> <br /> What struck me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen. They used some very dynamic camera work, which also made the boxing matches invigorating and exciting to watch, with the fight for the championship finale against John L. Sullivan as the big highlight. <br /> <br /> Biopics of the 1940s and earlier were obviously very different from biographies made today. Modern biographies often glorify their main subject and show their life basically from birth to death and everything, mainly emotional aspects, between the two. "Old" Biopics were made just like movies that were not based on real-life people, which also means that filmmakers often use a creative amount of freedom with the main character's personality and the events that have happened in their life. Her life. This film is also not just a biography of a boxing legend but also forms a good portrait of the period when bare illegal battles entered the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job portraying real life famous boxer James J. Corbett also known as Gentleman Jim. Few people knew this, but Flynn did some good acting work in the 1940s, of which this film is one of them. Fysicaly he also looks in the best shape. He also looks quite different by the way without his small mustache and trademark in this movie. The film also features some excellent supporting actors and some refined performances. <br /> <br /> A great and fun movie that still holds true today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
