This is the movie for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a totally captivating noir atmosphere of post-war Germany. You are absorbed in the dream and are released only in the final credits. The plot necessarily comes in second place, but it is still an exciting story, with difficult issues being raised. Just wonderful.
