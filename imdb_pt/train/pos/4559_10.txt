My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our home and her school, which is also occupied with other disabled children. I have been the target of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day that no one is, or will ever give a damn about her and her condition. So I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not utter a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything but cling to things. but this movie made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. And I saw SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously underestimated and should not. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking that you can not write well? This guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy was rejected by many girls because of his condition. Is not the fastest runner? Christy could not even stand. <br /> <br /> My point: Parents of young children, I suggest that your children watch this movie with you, so they know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they do not look they as if they were aliens. My sister has millions of looks and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening with many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
