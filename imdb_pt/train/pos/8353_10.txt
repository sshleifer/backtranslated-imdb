I remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night when they were the only paid channel for existing movies. At that time, it was UNRATED and was the only such film ever shown on pay television ... especially at that time. I would love to see this now as an adult where I would be more apt to understand his adult theme. It was probably the closest thing I'd ever seen in pornography at the young age of seven or eight. Luckily I had idiot babysitters and partying parents on the weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking houses for sniffing underwear, feeding on a mother's milk from a stranger on a public bus, and forking a cab at the request of one of his wives was just some of the escapades these guys were making. A very daring film for the early 70's. Until I checked the IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had so many followers. Most of the people I talk to have never heard of it.
