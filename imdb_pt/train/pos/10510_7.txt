This is an OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally fine, but I found Jeremy Northam quite wet as Mr. Knightley, particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine and her English accent is very good, but again, I preferred Kate Beckinsale's Emma. There are excellent supporting performances by Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often too lazy to laugh, the book is a comedy, but there are many jokes here, and also Frank Churchill's subplot is almost completely missing. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenario. It is very lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a box of chocolate. Only Americans would do that. <br /> <br /> In spite of these criticisms, I liked this movie, but I would recommend the TV adaptation more.
