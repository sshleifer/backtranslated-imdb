Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl who moves to Spain with her mother at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die and stays with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences very quickly. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is first of all a nuisance to her, so they become close. The film is filmed beautifully, bathed in mostly soft colors. Carol yearns for her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel the love he has for him. While the war itself is kind of a backseat in this movie, it involves the character's life. I think you will like it. See especially for Clara Lake, who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch.
