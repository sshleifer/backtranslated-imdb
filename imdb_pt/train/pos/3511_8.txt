Together with Fernando Fragata, João Mário Grilo, Abi Feijó, Leonel Vieira, écte (other commercial directors), Diamantino Costa is one of the best Portuguese directors; "Lampião da Estrela" was his first film (Diamantino Costa), before making several successful commercials. This title is played by one of the best Portuguese comedians of all time, Herman José and José Pedro Gomes are great. It's a very funny movie !! (28/07/2000) <br /> <br /> GOOD DIAMANTINE LUCK ...
