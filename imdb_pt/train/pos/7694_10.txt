I wonder why John Amos left the program and how he died again? I could not identify with everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever get out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We get to see them experience some good times. something they did not often have. I wish they would bring the show back. During the day, people can stay awake to watch. I do not think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what Good Times made Good Times. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
