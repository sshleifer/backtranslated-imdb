Little episode played mainly by laughter, but with a good dose of suspense. Somehow a Martian got aboard a broken bus on his way to nowhere but who is the passenger (talk about his illegal immigrants!). All-star supporting cast, wild-eyed Jack Elam (hamming it shamelessly), the sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian, so I say let's open the frontiers!), The Cruel Face John Hoyt (the suspect obvious) along with familiar faces like John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a good return from Bill Kendis as the bus driver). It's been a very amusing half hour, even though the action is limited to a single set.
