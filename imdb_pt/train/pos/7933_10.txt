Good times working with the Quiroz Brothers, and the whole cast of this project as the "Guy on the Bench". I was amazed at how well they managed to capture all the identifiable traits of a true "B" horror film. I hope to have the opportunity to work again with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and was recognized in public on several occasions since launch. Once it was in the video store and the girl almost lost her head. It was very funny and this was my first real autograph moment when I signed her receipt. One day I asked the girl from Blockbuster if the movie is rented frequently, and she confirmed looking at the computer. At the time, I was renting more than Ring2, which was also a new release at the time ... The title really captures immediate interest in more urban markets. She also noticed on many occasions that the movie had not been returned by the client, which led me to believe that the movie is so good that people do not want to return it ... Beware of ZoMbIeS when they are already! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench-2005)
