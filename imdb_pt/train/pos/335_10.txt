I've been trying to find out about this series for a long time! Thank you, IMDb! I saw it as a child and I was never able to get it out of my head. At the age of six, of course, I was particularly impressed by the episode of Cyclops, which was absolutely chilling (I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a Cyclops of a plastic cave man figurine, which I also remember, however, was the atmosphere, which was unusual from the start - mysterious, austere, and extremely authentic.When I read the original many years later, I felt the same sensation. Hollywood's "Odyssey" that I've seen since then has been a huge disappointment.The characters in this series looked genuine, real people - the ancient Greeks - and not some Hollywood stars in costumes. and why is it not available on VHS or DVD? I would love to get a chance to see it again!
