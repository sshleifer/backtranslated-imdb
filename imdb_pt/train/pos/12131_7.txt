The film has to do with Philip (Leslie Howard) he is a serious but poor medical student. He falls in love with a heartless and predatory waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). She gets him involved with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is romanced with other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but she returns in a mutually destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and the first of several film versions of the Somerset Maugham novel. Bette Davis as the cruel cockney waitress, earning yet another magnificent performance with seductive and steamy performance, utterly hypnotic in her account of servitude that runs from beginning to end. Davis rose to stardom with his performance. Her role as a tough and brutal domineering woman will be repeated several times in subsequent performances. Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance. He was an incredible actor (and the wind took) as well as producer and writer and died in plane crash during World War II. Both will play again in the etretrified forest (1936). The atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the studio RKO (Radio Picture Inc) is totally convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The movie will like movie classics. Very good but a bit dated.
