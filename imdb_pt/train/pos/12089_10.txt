Film dominated by black-haired Barbara Steele was seen when I was seven or eight years old and created permanent images of pale vampire men and women chasing a castle for blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies and supernatural beauty, and the visions of the undead predate Romero's shamblers, unifying them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see connection between this movie and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-unpretentious film, challenging you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such tie for Claire Bloom's HAUTING. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this movie does NOT need to be redone. Not only is it a product of the sixties, but the large percentage of untalented cretins in Hollywood can not understand MACABRE's formula of terror. This formula is based on a primordial factor: GOOD TO WRITE. Low-level classics like CASTLE and the films of Poe de Corman with R. Matheson and OUTNEY THE PASSON of Tourneur share a strong writing feature. It's simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot in the movie mess of today. Also, let Hollywood try some original material for a change, and stop exploring the obviously superior product of the past.
