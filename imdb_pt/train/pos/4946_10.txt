Angry! Morgan Freeman is an actor who researches a character to whom he is selected before making a commitment. Freeman is a 'good fit' for this movie (as he went to 'Driving Miss Daisy'), and he is not only believable but he has the chance to change his image of playing a character with dignity and decorum reserved. While there are no guarantees in life for anyone, this gives the actor a great opportunity to interpret different or unique characters that stand out in order to avoid stereotypes. And it must be said that stereotypes have harmed, or completely ruined, a significant number of careers in activity. <br /> <br /> This is a low budget movie that, surprisingly, was made in a time span of only two weeks. . It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA to set the movie, and the location helps set the tone and timing of the movie. The issue is fair to good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was the 'subcontractor', by getting Freeman to make this film while the actor was among the film projects. <br /> <There is good chemistry between Freeman and Peace Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens up an effective dialogue between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also encourages an understanding between people who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish) but also two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, customs, beliefs, customs, principles and values. The film seeks some honesty and comes to be true, to maintain the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been unemployed for four years. In fact, Freeman is so in demand as an actor who works constantly. <br /> <br /> The film offers an adventure of unity, care, sharing, exchange and exchange. And, the shots of the film give the viewer a preview of some of the things an actor must spend preparing for a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are having a 'mental health day'. and will see this movie. If you can, take your significant other or your family with you. I rate the film 10 out of 10. It's nice, interesting, informative, moving and valuable.
