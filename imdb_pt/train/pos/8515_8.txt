The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance for Christopher Lloyd, whom I like from previous films. The movie was a great family movie, nothing that would make you bother to show it to younger children, a good story, lots of laughs, cheerful and enjoyable. If you want to entertain kids without getting bored to tears, this fits into the bill. Nice kid, and it's not difficult for a parent to watch, too.
