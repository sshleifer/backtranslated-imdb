Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can do the accounts - 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell his story. The film is based on the premise that you can, in fact, tell a story in that short period of time. The premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each features a different aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost every director performs outstanding performances from a cast of great and almost excellent actors. <br /> <br /> There have been so many powerful portraits in this movie that it is difficult to choose one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me were Juliette Binoche as a bereaved mother in the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands as a beauty aged in the Latin Quarter, Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the "Loin du 16ème" segment and Margo Martindale as mail carrier from Colorado who learned to speak French to visit Paris (segment "14ème Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> Special mention should be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably the cruellest boy who ever besieged an American tourist at a Parisian subway station ("Tuileries" segment). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie. My wife and I decided to rent it out in a few months so we could pick up some of the subtle points we certainly missed. However, Paris is photographed so beautifully that I suggest you try to see it on a large screen. In any case, do not miss it!
