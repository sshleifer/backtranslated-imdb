Does anyone know where this movie was filmed? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, the Ivy apartment building certainly looks like the Brill Building, with its fascinating elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is listed as playing "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. Maybe he was her husband's lawyer, but then again, I do not remember the character in the movie, besides being mentioned as having made a phone call. Maybe he was on the aviation scene? Or the dance scene? Has anyone seen him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 when he filmed this movie.
