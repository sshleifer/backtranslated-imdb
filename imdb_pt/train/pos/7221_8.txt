Every time you think you have control over Deathtrap, another twist in the story comes along. Best to just sit and enjoy the ride on this one. Best known for his on-screen kiss between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which unfortunately was cut from the televised version I saw), this movie has a lot more to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his last several Broadway plays failed. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing more than support, both monetary and emotional, it does little to make Sidney feel better. To add insult to injury, young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) has just sent a play to Sidney to watch. It is the first of Anderson and Sidney can see that the young man is a talented writer. He plays with his wife to invite Anderson, kill him, and submit the play as his own. She laughs with him at first, but when Sidney invites Anderson to dinner, she worries that he may actually be putting the scheme into practice. And your fears can only be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant script. There are twists and turns throughout the plot, and they become faster and more furious as you near the end. It's the kind of movie you have on the tip of your seat from the beginning, and it keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Caine gives his usual excellent performance, and he displays a special talent for cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent interpretation of a man who is not as insightful or innocent as he seems. The frenetic Cannon works well for Myra. And Irene Worth does a good job as a nosy neighbor who is also a medium. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with an ending that you would never expect, and repeated clocks help you understand things lost previously. visions. A classic not celebrated that unfortunately is only remembered for a scene that stirred some sensibilities at the time - and this is a true shame.
