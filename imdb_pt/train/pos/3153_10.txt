I'm going to make it short and sweet because I do not think there's much that you can actually tell anyone about this show, which has never seen you different from your funny and unique to me, it's possibly the funniest show ever. <br /> <br /> You really have to watch it to understand your mood and I took a few episodes to really get into it, but when you're there, there's no turning back. For example, the way the Hydes character always wants to see his friends get into some sort of problem, the more he happens, the funnier he becomes. <br /> <br /> His classic is the cast, the writers, the director, it's just a recipe for success. One actor that I always find difficult is Ashton Kutcher, but I want to say that he's great at this show. I do not think it's possible that the character Kelso has been touched by someone else, it takes someone very clever to play someone that stupid. All main characters are great and would not be worth while review if I did not mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis, now this is a spicy know a ball ha ha the whole joking side amazing show.
