This movie is not great, but it's good and fun. It looks like an indie movie made out of a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swear that the script was not written for him. And there is the little irony of the actor who goes into a supermarket to do research for a movie that he has not yet committed. I mean, he actually made the movie at the end and we're watching him :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but refreshing though. This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction to follow. A little too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a cool little movie, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and some extras, directed dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
