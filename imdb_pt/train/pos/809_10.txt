A very good movie. A classic science fiction movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers more aliens. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and most of the imperial forces. The Emperor is rather an original character. I liked the Ewoks somehow representing the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also enjoyed the celebration of victory, where she fulfills the redemption of Vader and returns hi to the spirit Anakin Skywalker along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The biggest scenes of Star Wars are between this film: When Vader connects the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to attack Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a dark and deep side to this film, although there is a good ending. I felt there was so much more to it than it looks. And as always, John William's music will bring classicism to the Star Wars universe.
