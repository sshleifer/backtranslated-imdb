Genre Bender, Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that 'that' is both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in clay <br /> <br /> Then they all went away <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of the first season. I like this because the story is the type you never know what will happen next. It's totally original. The teaser is a lot of fun with the close-up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. I really need to learn my thumb that fools the genderbender that it does. I really like the atmosphere in the little village of Kindred and Mulder and Scully sneaking in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite episodes of the first season. I think the thing I like so much is how they end up being extraterrestrials at the end and left the circles on the plantations. Many people see this as an alien episode unrelated to mythology like "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think this could easily be seen as related to mythology. Maybe the genderbender was exactly like the alien bounty hunter and could seem like anyone. There is? Anyway I give episode 9 of 10.
