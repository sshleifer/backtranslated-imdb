I liked this movie. But I was surprised to see people refer to it as a comedy. It was fun at times, but really, it was not very funny at all. If I was hoping it was a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the movie, but without expectations, I found it enjoyable and engaging. Maybe because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with the satire of capital or labor, and more about the basic story of a man struggling for his invention. A man who is less interested in the monetary gains of his invention than in seeing it come to fruition and put into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to accept the money and the hot woman in exchange for suppressing his invention. So I think it's interesting that people here compared to Jurassic Park; I compared it to The Fountainhead.
