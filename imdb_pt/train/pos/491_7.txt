Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and place them on a paradise island where they will be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple but outrageous and funny. Let Fox throw morality out the window and let the debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about people plotting and manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple and the ultimate test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People either loved the show or hated it. It was like slowing down to look for a horrible traffic accident. You know you should not watch, but you can not help but stare. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
