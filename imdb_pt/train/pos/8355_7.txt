The film has a distinct (though brutal and rough) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy / lyrical punctuation points to the comic side of its misadventures, and even when they are mostly thuggish (like terrifying the woman on the train), a semi-pitiful vulnerability never hides (Dewaere sucks her breasts like a baby). Blier cuts to the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere, so we are never sure how to explicitly read the overtly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way, this incident is the beginning of their relative humanization. read as pro-gay, although it can be read as anything you want. The film has many objectionable sexual scenes and points of policy and is probably considered a general cartoon on the weaknesses of both sexes, ridiculing the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting innumerable points of possible depth based on that if you shoot enough shots, some of them are about to hit.
