For many people, Beat Street inspired their way of life to something creative about hip hop culture. <br /> <br /> Young Lee is living in NY in the 1980s, when hip hop was in the beginning. He is a member of staff on "Beat Street" - a b-boy team. The film follows Lee on his normal day, dancing, graffiti, etc. <br /> <br /> The director managed to make a movie with plot and at the same time introduce hip hop to the rest of the world. The film features old-school features such as Afrika Bambaataa and Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five, Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers and much more .... <br /> <br /> Neither the movie Beat Street or the spirit of Beat Street will die.
