This documentary is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, convincingly scaled, well written in the calculated and literate way that Hollywood discarded in the 1930s, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, standing out in its depiction of Native American culture (or, more appropriately, by its Canadian setting, "First Nations") with "Black Robe" as a beautifully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, around 1934). This idyllic portrait draws drama from its theme: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scotsman raised in Hastings (England) by unmarried aunts who became so obsessed with the "red tales of childhood" that he went to Canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a hunter and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man in the habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, none of whom seems to have thought less of him for this, for he too was an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (one smarter than he, according to most reports) has boosted him to fame as a writer and early advocate of protection of the northern wild country, and this forms the focus of Attenborough's history. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as the wife of Gray Owl, Pony) is engaging and, if it is not a fire, it is still touching. A good movie when you need some time out of the crazed crowd.
