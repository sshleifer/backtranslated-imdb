Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play guys in their 30s, who put their marraiges at risk, deciding (Russell reluctantly) to repeat their painful draw with rival Bakersfield years after the fact. Williams is fine but Russell is a great fighter as the legendary quarterback of the Taft, Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a good and attractive turn as Williams's wife, who could live without this rematch. The movie is worth watching just to see the famous Remus in action. Highly recommended.
