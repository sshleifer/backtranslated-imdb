Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to see this movie (so it's not a spoiler at all). I saw this movie when it was released and I still remember parts of it. It's all in a small town in the west or what's left of that town. More like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially bad. She lets her man die at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to her next, but just before she leaves, her dying man shoots behind her and deliberately does not reach her, and instead, the water supply. She is not aware that she will soon be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills two bad guys in a funny mansion - but that's another story, which I do not remember very well. The impression left from the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really mean woman in the movies, who pretends to be anything but evil - can not be compared to the witch in "Snowwhite", which, by comparison, is easy to to discover. Western very tight with few main characters and still absorbing.
