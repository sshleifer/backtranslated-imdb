I never saw this movie and I enjoyed singing and dancing for Cagney and the other cast members: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes on to produce prologues that are shown among the feature films shown in the movies during the 1930s. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and lots of laughs. Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role, which was also very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just beginning with his long and successful career on screen. Appreciate.
