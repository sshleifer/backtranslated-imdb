I think if you asked most of Jehovah's Witnesses if they expect miraculous healing because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know I do not know. What you will find instead is that they believe in the promises that Christ made of a resurrection. So, even if the worst happened and we died, maintaining our integrity, Jehovah can and will correct it. <br /> <br /> It really boils down to one simple question: Is God real to you or to you? Is all this just making you believe? If it is real, and you trust it, you will follow its instructions, no matter what the short-term result may be. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in large letters on my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would it be a good time to annoy the only one who could bring me back to life when the time came? She did not understand - God simply is not real enough for her. What a pity. I wish she could have the comfort that a strong faith gives.
