Everything is idyllic in the suburbs when the small family moves, because the father got a new job in a company of computers. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without the husband because he certainly holds secrets. The father is not a joiner, but the pressure is upon him to join, since everyone who is something in the neighborhood and at work is a member. The good boy part of Robert Urich is a bit tepid, but Joanna Cassidy as a good-humored housewife turning nasty hisses. Suspense and well-done chiller with a bitch Susan Lucci as president of the club. Keep an eye on Michael Berryman's favorite cult in a part as a valet. The film captures the feeling of paranoia and the final special effects are worth waiting for. I've seen this movie several times.
