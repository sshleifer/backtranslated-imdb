I must say I wanted to see this movie a long time ago and I was not disappointed. The performance of Dominic Monaghan is simply fantastic. As a sleepless part, I can relate to how the story unfolds. I've never experienced anything like it, but some awake moments overlap sleep and can be scary. It was a great movie, worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it for everyone. Maybe not small children as they may be scared. But if you are insomniac like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You will love. <br /> <br />
