Like almost everyone who commented on this movie, I can only imagine why this never appeared on video. <br /> I remember seeing him around the age of 12 on "The Late Show," circa 1972. I also remember the attack with poison gas and the weird horses. (I do not remember the most terrible parts I've ever seen described here, they've probably been cut to the TV audience.) But the scenes I REALLY liked were those involving Lord Kitchener's death aboard HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes of the damned cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really creepy, if I remember correctly. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the musical score, but the comments of others now make me curious. Get that one off on video!
