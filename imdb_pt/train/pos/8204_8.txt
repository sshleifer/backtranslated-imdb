Sudden Impact was better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was building to be a great movie, but then I saw the villain (s) and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact was different than the previous installments. The plot went a different direction in this film, since Dirty Harry does not adopt a police approach this time. We also do not see the villain until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as Dirty Harry, enough said. Pat Hingle was entertaining as Chief Jannings, Harry's newly appointed chief. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here, anyway, he was no different. Michael Currie is decent as Lieutenant Donnelly, Harry's annoying superior. I personally liked Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace, friend of Harry. Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian by the city. Jack Thibeau was well cast as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the very bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-time lover, was horribly misled like Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just awful like Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would have been much better if it was not better to write and act in some parts. 8/10.
