I was watching this when my wife called to ask the other room about my rate choice. My comment? "I'm watching my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only for 5 years or more, than the "Rocket Boys" I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our education administrators and how the whole Science thing Fair gained momentum and led me and others to the competitive whirlwind. My own tornado took me to my own Science Fair in Physics in 62, although our group had been less successful in getting the support of firefighters who we sought for guidance and advice until after a tragic event, our city was so far in which allows us to visit the local Nike missile on the shore of Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie brought it all back to me and I bet it brought it all back to a lot of us "UberNerds" from the late 50's and early 60's. /> We are in a similar period of cerebral drainage and now we really need this film as a country. Look!
