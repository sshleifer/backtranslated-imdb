For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and the comedic timing of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments for this fantastic movie. I especially like the multiplicity of colors and the way the shock in the scenes of the sports arena. The parody of Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries is also a lot of fun.
