It made me wish my own happy birds could talk. Talk to the reviewer who said the movie. A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a lovely little treasure. It has some clever lines that really made me laugh. I particularly loved the dance sequences during his showbiz. You can forgive the obvious cliches while encouraging him in the quest to meet Marie. A charming film with two strong characters who really make friends with the little parrot apart from its young owner. I would have liked to have seen more of the woman who is blind and must abandon their mutual journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame she could not share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally with Marie, perhaps accompanied by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.
