The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. Does not present a series of beautiful photos. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. This forces the viewer to process constantly or perhaps to imagine the context of the various takes. That kind of thing is easy to try, but it's hard to succeed. The film refuses to use a one-gender crutch to help less-interested viewers understand what's going on. Instead, the film touches and goes through several different genres. The trick to loving the movie is to enjoy this joke. I suspect 99% of American viewers simply will not understand. If you try to define the narrative of this film, or the philosophical message, or the symbolist structure, etc., you will waste your time. There is none of this. The film only feints for these genres and sometimes others. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Denis's own sense of what fits. There are so few feature films that come close to satisfying Kant's description of what art is, namely, enjoying the power of judgment itself, rather than simply subsuming experiences under the concepts. The cinema usually takes the easy way and opts for the simplest pleasure to understand what is happening. Most movies are not art. Most movies do not come close to art. When a film does that, and it's still pleasing to a large number of viewers, it's a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I find the film very simplistically buying the various narrative threads that go through it. The Tahiti parent-child narrative, even if it is not exactly conventional, ends up making things a bit clear and simple. That dominates too much.
