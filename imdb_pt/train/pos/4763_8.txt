Unlike other reviews, I found this movie fascinating, even with all its flaws and zombie acting from some of the actors. <br /> <br /> Being a technologist, I found the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. While reading people's minds via computer sounds fantastic, experiments are now underway to do just that. I will note that these experiments are at an early stage, with results so far unfavorable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie are well released. The girl, though she exaggerates a little, sounds stupid. The truck driver is a ringer for real truck drivers. The chief minister tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure whether he believes that God created man or that man created God. But the minute the chips fell, he falls. The film is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by the government. As strictly a thriller, the film does not have enough emotions. As a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations is fascinating.
