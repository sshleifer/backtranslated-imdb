This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, "Enough is enough!" Of course it is not as beautiful as the Woo can offer, but the scanning work is done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is accused of murdering the governor by a team using a cyborg resembling a pair, it is up to Eric to clear his name. Wilson manages to pull Van Damme's duty while he plays the heroic lead and his cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, cars exploding (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shootings. I particularly liked the van that flies in the air before even getting close to touching a blasting truck. My other favorite part involved a girl from the neighborhood coming to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some cheap effects on the effects of LAWNMOWER MAN around 1995.
