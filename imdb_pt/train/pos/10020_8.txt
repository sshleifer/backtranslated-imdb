The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four suspense clocks cheap in Mexico. This is the moody token entry period of gothic horror group. Karloff gives a typically active and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his mean-spirited petty, greedy and moody relatives to his chilling decadent castle for a testament reading. Soon the hateful guests are being driven out by life-size lethal toy people who populate the place. Yesterday, the Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of the infamy of "Tintorera" portrays the police hero and Julissa seems absolutely enthralling as the only nice female character. The clumsy, heavy (no) direction, trivial script, ugly, faded cinematography, ridiculous murder pieces (a fat fat ass is beaten in the face by a miniature cannon!), Exaggerated score, morbid and melancholy atmosphere, largely (Karloff notably excepted), light gore gourd, poor dubbing and stimulating conclusion, all this lends to this pleasant and horrible lemon a certain crudely and therefore strangely funny charm. A real exaggerated pio.
