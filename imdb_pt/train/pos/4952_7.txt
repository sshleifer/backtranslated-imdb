Revised September 12, 2006, at the Paramount 1 Cinema during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film premiered world-wide the day before in the Elgin VISA Theater Exhibition Hall. The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a popular actor who is in the downturn of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him but that he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs pay rent etc. The slope is indicated by it being a long time between roles with previous films in DVD bargains and his being a driver. by a not very sure production assistant himself who leaves Freeman at a local community market where he will do research for a supermarket manager role. He soon discovers that the real-life market is run by an employee of the checkout line "10 Items or Less", played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's trip never comes back and Vega needs help getting ready for an interview, circumstances make them join forces on a city tour to bring Freeman back home and get a job for Vega. <br /> <br /> While the film was enjoyable, it looked like it was still an outline or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car, one that literally plays like a video clip by Paul Simon) that seemed to calm the time and yet the film was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing that Morgan Freeman is as dear as he is because without him that would have been very little. Of course it was funny in parts and Peace Vega is a delight too, but there was not enough here to say it was a complete movie. <br /> <br /> They got me lost when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car. to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does. Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no !? In the real world it is just the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay for the outtakes on the credits. The bit with a Target Store saleswoman teaching Morgan Freeman to rush sales is simply hilarious! A little earlier, where Freeman's driver insists it's Freeman's voice on a "Books on Tape" reading was also pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief question-and-answer session. screening. Silberling answered a question stating that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that as soon as Freeman took over the role, he actually changed very little of what was there. A big compliment to Silberling's writings and also about how Freeman can simply take on a role and make him feel like he was born to play it.
