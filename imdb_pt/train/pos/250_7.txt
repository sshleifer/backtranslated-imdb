Those who know who knows the "legend" of Kelly and hope that this film is an accurate representation of their life may be disappointed by the creative license obtained with this film (for example, Naomi Watt's character never really existed), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it behaves very well. Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of Ned's best film (not difficult to consider the previous Ned include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger and former champion Carlton (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great football player, but a poor actor.Some shooting locations in the area that I live in, Bacchus Marsh out of Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
