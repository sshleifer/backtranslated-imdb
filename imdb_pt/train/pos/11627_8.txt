Lisa is a hotel manager and owner and boarding a flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to a killer named Jackson, who tells her that she has to move a family room or her father dies. The reason she has to change the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> It's a great suspense movie because Lisa tries several ways to escape this maneuver that Jackson set up. The whole plot is great and I thought they could have spent more time on the plane. Could not have more for the plane, but besides, the whole movie was very good. <br /> I especially liked the ending because it was heart stopping. I did not know what would happen and I was surprised by that. For me, this movie just took off.
