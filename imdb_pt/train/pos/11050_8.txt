Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This film about 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells written by another prisoner centuries ago was an excellent hidden thriller with an amazing ending and very suspense. Even if it had something like a play (almost everything happens in the cell), it never got boring and was very well done. In the "Cube" tradition you felt trapped with the Characters and even if they were criminals, you developed some sympathy with some of them, just to change your mind by the twists and turns that history takes. Some events caught you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air. Completely intense and fun and as I expected nothing (a friend rented), it was a positive surprise!
