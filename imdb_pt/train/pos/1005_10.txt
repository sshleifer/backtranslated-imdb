Verhoeven's film was total and complete trash. It is a disgusting hack from a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored and decided to do the whole thing from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would NEVER have supported that rubbish if he were alive to see it. He basically steals the name, mocks the policy of the book (which is a good part of it), and plays some T & A, so the idiot American viewer does not get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not Not perfect, but is at least almost always accurate, the best I can say.
