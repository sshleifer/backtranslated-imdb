The WWE was in need of a savior as Wrestlemania 14 rolled around. Bret Hart's departure and subsequent evaporation from the Hart Foundation left the Vile D-Generation X stable in WWE. Its despicable leader Shawn Michaels had robbed the title of Hart thanks to the interference of Vince McMahon and, with the help of his companions, Triple H and Chyna systematically removed any that defied its supremacy. But at the Royal Rumble came a new competitor. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonagement, Austin had DX worried. So worried, in fact, that they asked for the help of "The Bad Man on the Planet," Mike Tyson, as a special executor. Austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title fight with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was an undercard to be eliminated with the Legion of Doom, winning a forgettable battle of 15 times for the Royal. become NO.1 candidates for the tag titles. I really forgot that this game existed until I reviewed the PPV. Not very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division in that period in time. <br /> <br /> Next game saw the Light Heavyweight title champion champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila. WWE had established the Light Heavyweight title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight division at WCW. It was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania. Short game, going about five minutes, and actually too short for much to be achieved. The little they did was exciting and this was a beautiful game that saw Taka keep the title. <br /> <br /> OK, our next match was Triple H, a member of the DX, defending the European WWE title, which he won in Shawn Michaels' fashionable Farce in RAW in December and had not defended in PPV against Owen Hart, the Sole Survivor. Triple H got a big ticket with the DX band to play their theme song. Chyna accompanied Triple H to the ring, but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissar Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a good game, before Chyna interferes causing a low blow to Hart, which leads Triple H to retain the title. Good game, it could have been great if it had stayed a little longer. <br /> <br /> But of course we would not want to spend time away from our next match that saw real-life husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable defeat Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed fight at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And in all honesty, it was not worth the wait. Although not terrible, the match was also not memorable. This was the end of Mero's only run in WWE and the main goal was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Then we saw Ken Shamrock play out and cost himself the Intercontinental Championship. as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock but later refused to let go of his ankle block submission, resulting in the referee reversing his decision. This was a short game, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Then saw the first good game of the night as WWE Tag Team Champions the New Age Outlaws lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun junk game. The decision was overturned the following night when Cactus and the chainsaw had thrown the Outlaws into a trash bin behind the scenes instead of the one being used at the match, but it was still a fun game. <br /> <br /> It was not time. for the first highly anticipated encounter between Kane and his brother, the Undertaker. Kane had cost Undertaker the WWE Championship in the Royal Rumble and then "killed" him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock Undertaker into a coffin and set him on fire as revenge for the Undertaker setting fire to his parents' home and making him terribly disfigured years before. This was a decent game and told a nice story as the Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match. <br /> <br /> This left only the main event that saw WWE. The champion faced Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as the guest enforcer. Michaels suffered a debilitating back injury in his Undertaker match at the Royal Rumble and was notable in this match despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banished early on after interfering outside. The game ended with Austin lowering an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and hitting Stone Cold Stunner with the referee. TYson then entered the ring to count the three, celebrating the win with Austin and then knocking out Michaels after the match. It turns out that Tyson and Austin were together and the cat was playing with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> This was the last PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. He helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity won by Tyson's appearance proved to be a crucial turning point in WWE's battle with WCW. Austin would become the biggest star in WWE history, and along with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H would lead the WWE during the time when they would gain the highest level of cultural relevance. And it all started here at Wrestlemania 14.
