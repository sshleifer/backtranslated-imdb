Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why, but treat it as a low-budget serial killer movie and you can get more than most. <br /> <br /> I thought this worked out in a way because then I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that's some degree of success would not it? <br /> <br /> I would say that there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin, although the acting is perhaps a little uneven. David Hess is just in this brielfy, so do not expect much from Last House. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's worth a look.
