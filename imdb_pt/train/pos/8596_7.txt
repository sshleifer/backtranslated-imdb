I thought the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I had a good surprise. The movie is not a good thing but it's a lot of fun and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of TV series as 24 or Alias. It's very similar to this series and reminded me too, Wolfgang Petersen's thriller in the line of fire. If you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies, you'll be disappointed. if you go with low expectations, you will enjoy The Sentinel. Rating: 7
