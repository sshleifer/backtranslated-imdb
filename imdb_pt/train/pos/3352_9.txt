there should be a sub-genre in the West called "the Robert Mitchum Western." Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, and usually undervalued Westerns import his cinematic noir personality to record some drafts of incredibly dark characters and bring a world-worn fatigue of more familiar Sam Peckinpah films. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Directed by Richard Wilson, protégé of Orson Welles, it is an austere and monochromatic beauty, full of frightening silhouettes and terrible outbursts of savage violence, while Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a soft-spoken stranger to an insane killer, with a series of black emotions in between, is a marvel of expressive physical performance.
