According to the book Cowboy's Last of Heroes, which is about Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only film that he personally did not analyze because he claimed he was lost. He had not been seen in years. <br /> <br /> Good thing to Western fans, someone was doing Paramount's cleanup because apparently a hard copy was found and is now on the open market. Albuquerque is also a good Westerner with Scott involved in a family fray with Uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making him part of his freight business, based in the city. Albuquerque fast-growing settlement. Cleveland is more than just an entrepreneur; he is the boss of the city he drives from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero at all. This includes not supporting relatives when they are villains. He will work for a rival team led by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all sorts of tricks and it even sends to a Western Hari Mata in the person of Barbara Britton. to enter into the confidence of their rivals. Barbara is great as the homely bitch who develops her own agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original home studio went to Paramount, where it was his first studio deal. Albuquerque scored the last film he ever made for Paramount and they gave him a good movie. Note also Lon Chaney, Jr., who is the chief captain of George Cleveland, a rather disgusting bully of a man and Gabby. Hayes, who is just Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque must have been loved by Republicans across the country in 1948 with its main villain as head of a city that rules in a wheelchair. A certain democrat of a wheelchair had made a hash of them for four presidential elections and he was gone. They had high hopes of winning the White House that year as well, but things went awry and they had to settle for a substitute boss getting their punishment in Albuquerque. I do not know why Cleveland was in a wheelchair, since nothing was actually done in the plot. My guess is that he was injured and played the role that way because he had to do it. <br /> <br /> Still, Albuquerque must have had great appeal to the Republican Party market.
