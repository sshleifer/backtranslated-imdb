Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural gulf between an indigenous population and the white invader. Although it was filmed in a seemingly non-professional documentary style, Eskimo is a skillful production that contains a believable story that the audience will want to see until the final scene. <br /> <br /> The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than whalers who darken their landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his mate, it is natural for other men to share their wives with their friend. It is also common for women to take the place of the missing spouse. All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate Arctic landscape. The confident Eskimo is the victim of unscrupulous white whalers (with strong European accents) who do not see these natives as equals. Deception, drunken orgies, rape, and death occur after the Eskimos set out to work in cold, icy seas. Eventually, the main Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been cheated and he revenges himself. The audience would have applauded in the 1930s theaters. Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of bringing Mala to trial. The Montes are thrown as police officers who know this is not a dry and dry case. Will the Mounties get their man? Is it fair to keep Mala with a code of behavior outside of your traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law prevails? Is there no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie but you will appreciate it for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting. I suspect filming of animal sequences was made before today's announcement that no one was injured in the production of the film - so be careful with the sequences of gross nature. Highly recommended.
