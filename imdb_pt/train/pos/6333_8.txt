I just used this video and watched it last night. The acting started extremely bad (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but got pretty good right after wards. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dubious, but the scene with the house breaking and the contents inside being blown and sucked were extremely well done, and virtually on par with movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done as well. The story was very well written, and it's refreshing to watch a movie like this move away from the same old "formula disasters" movies of this genre that seems to have been stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> Film had a very strange mix of acting quality and effects, it deserves an A in my book.
