I went to this movie on a cast and crew show because my friend, who is a producer in the movie, invited me. Forget what you saw in the commercials, forget what you heard, go see this movie for you. I was more than surprised by that. In a world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, here comes a movie that is worth your hard-earned money! Glorious scenes, wonderful cinematography and a cast you want to eat with your heart. I found this to be one of the most orchestrated years and rightly so. Robert Deniro deserves a nod. If you could give everyone a stake as a package, this would be the movie.
