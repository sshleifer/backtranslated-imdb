As far as I know, this show has never been replayed on UK television after its original execution in the late 60's / early 70's, and most episodes are now sadly "presumed gone missing." <br /> <br /> Series 6 of 1971 however still exists in its entirety, and I recently got a chance to watch everything, the best part of 4 decades later. <br /> <br /> After running home from school, Freewheelers was essential to me and to many of my contemporaries in those happy days of slacks, Slade and Chicory Tip. And watching him again brought a nostalgic knot to the throat. No matter the bad / hammy acting, the fight scenes unintentionally fun, plot holes large enough to pilot a large ocean yacht through and the "frighteningly, frighteningly" RADA accents the top players. <br /> <br /> Do not forget all that. Because Freewheelers goes back to a bygone era (I dare say "golden") of children's drama, when the shows were just fun and did not take themselves so seriously. Before they became obsessed with all the "ishoos" charged with anguish today's writers have their young protagonists concerned, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STDs, etc. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, if it were "redone for a modern audience" in these days of politically correct all-pervasive, the figure of the boss would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be a white boy confused about his sexuality and the girl would be a fighter of all actions with an off-scale IQ, who would always be pulling the boys out of scratches and making them look foolish - in other words, a million miles removed from the deferent , Wendy Padbury's ankle sprain. <br /> <br /> It's a show that is very "of your time". But is that a bad thing? I do not think so.
