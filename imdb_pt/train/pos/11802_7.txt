This is not the best Bigfoot of all time, but by the recent patterns of Nature's movies, mostly displayed on the Sci-Fi channel, this is a quality thing. It has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. The CG is used, but it's also some practical F / X, which I like. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth watching if you are a fan of horror / science fiction and need a solution. It's better than the Sasquatch movie and not a sequel, so make no mistake about it. <br /> <br /> The acting is better than you can hope to find in a movie like that and the direction is more than adequate. . Wait a bit as the characters are "developed", but know that things will catch on. If you're watching a DVD, you can skip a chapter or two.
