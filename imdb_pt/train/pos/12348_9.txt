This helps immensely if someone is familiar with the culture and the length of time this movie happens. First of all, these ladies are not geishas, ​​they are oiran (prostitutes) in the "green houses" of the type Yoshiwara, around 1860, more or less. This should help to clarify some details that may be confusing to the unconscious. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps more importantly, how people deal with adversity, both yours and others in their immediate environment. That apart from the scandalous photography coupled with the frighteningly beautiful music, make a lovely walk. Just plug it in, suspend your disbelief, and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
