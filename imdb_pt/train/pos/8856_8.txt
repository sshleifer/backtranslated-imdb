BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU ARE DEAD starts promising, establishing a simple assault that goes wrong, counted from various perspectives (in the RASHOMON style). Around the time mark, Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is much more than the sum of its parts; eventually turns into a multifaceted family drama, exploring the whole domain of human emotions / relationships, as the story reaches its chilling climax. <br /> <br /> As is the case with Lumet, he manages to stimulate performances of his star-studded cast, without any notion of over-action or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often beats Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. This is not to say that Hawke is not bad; in fact, he is well above the proper, in a problematic role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she discovers her flesh contributes to this). The character of Albert Finney (the father of Andy and Hank) is the most intriguing and, in my opinion, he deserved a little more time on the screen. Amy Ryan also does her job properly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU ARE DEAD is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game in the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of their features and trademarks appear here, not less than involving the use of their characters. Infused with a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing, and a decent punctuation, before the devil knows you're dead is a must-have. A truly underrated gem. TripAdvisor Traveler Rating Should only get in my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
