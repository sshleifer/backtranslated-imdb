Stan and Ollie become SAPS AT THE SEA when their rebel boat is attacked by a vicious killer. <br /> <br /> The boys are wonderful in this movie, which begins with one of their most hilarious pieces, the horn factory. . Always with a few steps out of sync with the rest of the Creation, Laurel and Hardy inhabit a world where icy radios and goats are the rule, not the exception. With its short duration, the film is more in style with its classic short themes, which explains its episodic nature. <br /> <br /> Only the boys get screen credits, but movie experts will recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears as a crazy doctor, Richard Cramer does full justice to his role of thug, the sweet Mary Gordon plays the perplexed neighbor of the boys. This is Charlie Hall as the apartment receptionist and the comedy humor of the silent filmmaker Ben Turpin plays a very peculiar plumber. <br /> <br /> One of the screenwriters of the film was comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan & Ollie are the main focus, however. Watching Hardy get furious with the sound of a bugle, or Laurel's antics with bananas, for example, reminds the viewer why these guys remain absolute cinematic giants.
