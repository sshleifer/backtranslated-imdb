This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts at first, but the movie got better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for the audience in search of action, but for those who like an explicit portrait of a criminal, man, lover and very strange husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit difficult to follow a few times, but in the end I think everything just got better. The ending was unexpected, since you were almost knocked over to think it would end otherwise. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think it was good. It will not be for an Oscar award for long, but at least caught my attention. Gil Bellows portrait of a man from prison is not always perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Shaun Parkes's portrait of Bellows Clinique fellow prisoner is large and extremely powerful. On the negative side, I think I'm going to put Esai Morales, the portrait of Markie. <br /> <br /> Accept my advice and watch this movie, you will love it or not!
