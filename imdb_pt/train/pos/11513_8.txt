One of my favorite shows in the '70s. As I recall, it aired on Friday (or possibly Saturday) night on the Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually climaxed with Kolchack having to engage in close combat with some kind of supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode in which the opponent was the spirit of a former Indian chief. who "returned" as a massive electric current that began killing people in a city hospital. The final confrontation caused Kolchack to try to short-circuit the "power beast" amidst an explosion of sparks and flames. Oh well ... you had to be there at the time, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always gave a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his roles and this was one of his best. Definitely deserves a place in the "Hall of Fame" TV. To quote Tony Vincenzo ... 'Kolchack you're at it' ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, 'IN it'!
