The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled on Alan Quartermain (or at least it's a character type from Alan Quartermain) that the director of 85 made the mistake of looting the IJ movies for dialogues and stories very deeply. What you have as a finished product was a confusing mess of the name Alan Quartermain, in an uneven hodgepodge of a cheap IJ saga (with a hint of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It has been labeled by many critics as a "grand parody" or "unintentional comedy." Unintentional is the word. This movie was never meant to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, he's smarter than witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series, you get a lot more story, character development from your lead, solid portraits and a fine, fun mix. This story is a bit long; much more than its predecessors, but deservedly, as this version carries a real plot and not just Action and Eye Candy. Despite presenting both the action and Eye Candy, he also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version, forgetting IJ all together and returning to source materials for AQ, creating a well thought-out plot and some good subplot complements. <br /> <br /> Now, this attempt is not the extravaganza of action that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be so. This vehicle is plotted and directed by characters and is a beautiful version of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on location in South Africa, the public gets beautiful views (if desolate), SA Aboriginal cultures and some wildlife scenes to blend in perfectly with the performances and history here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum totally amazed me with this, as I have never been one to endorse his vision. In fact, I did not enjoy most of his work as a director until this attempt. I hope this is more of a new vein of talent and less the chance it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version ranks 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale of ... <br /> The Demon :.
