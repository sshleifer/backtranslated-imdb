Despite all the enthusiasm, respect and recognition that this film receives from the historians of Kung Fu, it still lacks glamor in some critical areas: action and fighting scenes. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I have ever seen in a martial arts film. Five deadly poisons, undoubtedly, is a must see, not only this, a movie that you can watch again and again; but I must also say that after watching you feel that it could have been even better. Somehow, it leaves you wanting something, you want more. Producer Chang Cheh sets the plot beautifully for a potential masterpeice, but it does not give us more of the action we want. The fighting styles in the film actually capture the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpio, Lizard, Frog) and they are shown, but battles are visibly short. The Frog and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been far, far more screened, in fact, Frog is dead in the middle of the movie. Curiously, with this movie, the absence of constant action or struggle leads to the development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu movies where you are really interested in the plot and worries about the outcome. This movie has a dark and cruel tone and you are attracted to the vibe. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the film and increase the film's feel. To start the film and introduce the producer of the Poison Clan, Chang Cheh takes us to a dirty dungeon. The final fight scenes are certainly good, but they seem muted and somehow you expected more. Still, this movie is one of the best Shaw Brothers and is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the movie would end with this: the styles that the fighters used are just shown to us and not displayed in detail, what is sad is that the director had the goods for something extraordinary at his fingertips and did not expand. . I was wondering what could have been with this movie, still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
