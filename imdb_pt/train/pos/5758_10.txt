This in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the '70s. Not only does it feature a great cast, but it's also loaded with shootings and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a Vietnam veteran (Kris Kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris begins to take advantage of his position and becomes as bad as criminals he was hired to get rid of. It's great to see Kris play against the guy. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows a real persona of movie star in this film. I do not think Vigilante Force is on video, but occasionally it appears on TV. It's a great movie for the guys who like movies.
