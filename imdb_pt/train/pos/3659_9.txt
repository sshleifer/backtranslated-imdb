This movie was my first contact with Mr. Sica, so I really did not know what to expect. But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complex and shows us a boy orphan's life found and particularly his connection to the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple sheet metal houses. This small town in another city lives its own life and things are going well. But one day there is a water resource found and a rich and noble man is interested in buying the place. But as the movie title suggests - there is a miracle going on. Our character receives a wonderful dove from his dead mother. What will he do to protect his friends and the whole city built too? <br /> <br /> It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. There is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people. Also many funny moments and scenes are included - at first, with the place where the sun is shining and many more. <br /> <br /> So, according to the fact that I'm not a comedy lover, you should see this movie because I liked it a lot <br /> <br />
