As a long-time fan of Barbra, any post like this will be biased. What aside, this movie ranks as a classic. It has its flaws (emphasized in other posts), but it gives a glimpse of a time (late 70's) that will never be there again, and it's fascinating to see unfold on the screen. Streisand fought hard to make this movie of her own. I do not think she was satisfied. But it gives its fans a new Barbra (for the season) with LIVE singing, a young and new look and a very heavy performance. <br /> <br /> The story is rude, but exciting, and keeps its interest throughout. The extended "finale" of a frame is difficult for most non-Barbra fans, but speaks volumes to those who admire their talent. <br /> <br />
