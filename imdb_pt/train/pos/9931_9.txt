I rent dominoes on a whim, not even knowing that it was inspired by a true story, and even if it's the least likely and true thing you'll probably see. I thought it was quite impressive. With Richard Kelly writing, he brings together a mass of plots and narratives in two hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once, you understand and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a bounty hunter turned model who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career. It has a nervous acid travel style provided by director Tony Scott. And with fast editing and music, it provides the visual brightness to keep your attention, with fluid performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well done and enjoyable and must have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest to anyone who wants to think and have fun at the same time for 2 hours.
