This film really captures the feeling of freedom ... and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth ... in the most pleasant and carefree way. It is not a serious but hilarious adventure. <br /> <br /> History mirrors life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we find we have what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... which results in us getting more than we thought we would get! You'll get it after you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is truly about finding love and knowing that someone has found it and that it has totally changed someone's life. <br /> <br /> It's one of my all time favorites ... ..is not easy to find, but it's worth hunting for ......... I guarantee you'll watch over once!
