How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is in all honesty one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of those "coarse" comedies that rely heavily on fart jokes and bathroom humor, but instead move in a gentle rhythm and you'll be easily connected to the unfolding narrative. Simon Pegg catches him in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish character out of water and quickly stands out from the tripod he once owned in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Delivering himself at the top of the Hollywood food chain is a difficult thing to do, as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first jab in the lead role was David Schwimmer's Run Fatboy Run comedy, but received warm criticism from the public. His second attempt is this movie, got quite positive reviews from most, but was a failure at the box office. I, on the one hand, have not lost faith in him yet and will still be there whenever he wants to take the third shot to glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters were chosen from Jeff Bridges for Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst in my opinion did well in this movie as the angle of love for the character of Pegg, however, the spark I saw in Interview with the Vampire is still lost. She needs to find him, fast or she can suffer the consequences of getting lost in the land of "rom-coms" forever.
