A must for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made the Ramones a household name in the early '80s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best of the American Punk Rock movies, with a classic cult status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally the producers wanted Cheap Trick as stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" had just made them superstar and a very hot item to be in a low-budget movie. Lucky for the Ramones who were trying to get out of the underground world of punk rock and into the mainstream market (which unfortunately never happened until after the band's end). The band, Dee Dee especially, always hated the movie in the 80's, but the fans always loved and could recite most of the film while waiting to enter the Ramones shows. This movie, like most classics, is a stupid diversion with some classic scenes of Ramones in their heyday. Do not wait, you will not find it. It's a lot of fun, so enjoy. Another classic Allan Arkush movie in a similar vein is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving from legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
