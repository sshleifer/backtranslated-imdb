A cheerful comedy, Nothing shows us a world that sometimes we wish to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you do not like, be it a pile of beads, a bad memory or even hunger, can disappear to your desire. They approached this movie very well, and with a couple of nice stardom, there were just a few things I did not like about Nothing, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credits scene (and yes, there is one): Good for a laugh but what were they trying to do with it? I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. Instead, we hear only a random assortment of noises and they scream. He tries to create a sequel in my opinion, and it was not really necessary, nor was it funny after the turtle crept out of the frame. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD. and as others have said, promotes a horror film that never came. Ah, well, poor marketing, I think. <br /> <br /> If you see this in your movie store, take a look because Nothing is a great movie to watch. If you have a big screen, you may want to wear masks.
