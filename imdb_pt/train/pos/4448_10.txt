I saw this movie yesterday for the first time and I enjoyed it. I am a student of screenwriting and I loved the way the secondary characters intervened when something fundamental / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very acute and the premise of the story is quite shocking - at one point Barbara Stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's boyfriend; And rekindle some passion in her husband she has not seen in ten years; And with the shooting shot "two shots and then one," she connects with her old Dutch fuck (the reason she left town in the first place!) EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME! The moral majority must have been totally outraged when they saw this film in the 1950s. I love costumes, cinematography, and direct hip dialogue - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co doing the 'Bunny' Embrace is reason enough to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of that period I've seen in a long time.
