Whenever a film is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life that any of your photos will be seen by generation after generation. Just have Claudette Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I," 47 appearing and starring the film, making it even more of a great classic movie. In this film, Ellen Ewing gets married and then finds all sorts of mental problems and even murders. The mystery gets very involved and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", 65, comes to Ellen's aid and sometimes you wonder about David being on the rise. When you see this image, you begin to understand who the crazy person is, and suddenly you begin to change your mind about how the movie ends. Great acting by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a totally different role from what he usually portrays on screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a great movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie with great classic actors!
