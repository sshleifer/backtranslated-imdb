I thought it was an extremely clever film. I was very pleased with this and really could not 'ask for more. I actually own the movie because I did not return it to someone ... What I should do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I liked it. Also, the fact that I do not own many foreign films and this is the first. Now, I personally love Finnish things, which definitely contributed to how much I enjoyed it. But overall, it's worth watching. However, if you are not generally trying to understand the Finnish or read the subtitle bit, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for sure.
