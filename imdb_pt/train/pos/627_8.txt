Except for a strange scene, this refreshing fairy-tale fantasy has a fun and delightful stream of adult cynical wit that enchants its way into the audience, as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic. Except for one of Robert DeNiro's scenes that does not seem smooth and seems out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this delightful romantic fairy tail has a great sense of story telling and the strong magic and balance between serious adventure scenes and the lightest spiritual mood are well made. In the up-to-date tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight of ten stars.
