Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. She agrees with the condition that they do not exchange any information about each other - not even names. Sometimes these are the best types of dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. Her alibi is the mysterious woman, but no one remembers seeing her, and as a result, Scott is condemned to die for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and goes after the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind the Kansas attempts to get to the truth. We followed her through some memorable scenes, for example, the quest for Mac the bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic place where Cliff the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) takes her out, drinking and dancing while he jams with your friends . This is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a prominent part of the film while everyone swears intensely and rhythmically during the scene. Ella Raines is good in the lead female role and Thomas Gomez makes a nice cop. Alan Curtis started off as the man confused and innocent but once he is arrested, his performance took a left turn when he became totally unpleasant for Kansas without a reason. God knows why she stayed with him. <br /> <br /> The movie does not make you think of who the killer is, as we know from the middle of the movie, but it does not matter. In fact, this increases the tension and dramatic development of history as well as Kansas to find out what is happening and then get the hell out! It's a good movie with great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I never like him in anything I see ... someone hands me a tie .....
