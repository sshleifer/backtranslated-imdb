I saw this movie twice in community shows and really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the film really captured some of the essence and flavor of the community - courage, determination, exuberance, creativity, in its disposition with a dose of desperation. The writing, the dialogue and the acting are solid and I really felt attracted to the story of the young Raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not get lost in the process. Great dance sequences and it's not just the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera also moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multi-dimensional - neither totally good nor bad and the female characters are admirably strong. This is a movie that has a strong heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.
