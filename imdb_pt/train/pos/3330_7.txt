I was not just an extra in this movie, I could see it in Boston for a packed cinema. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans packed a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy ... about them ... Red Sox fans! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are a cute comedy about love and lust. Love is between the two young lovers. Lust is for the Red Sox to win the World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He's funny enough and gets more laughs. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same Barrymore. At times, I felt that supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. To the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
