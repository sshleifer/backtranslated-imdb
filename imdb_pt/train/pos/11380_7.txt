Although the word megalomania is often used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes your dance is very hard, you have to admit that the guy knows how to do a show. In American, in Paris, he choreographed some extraordinary numbers, some that paralyze the plot, but are nevertheless surprising to look at. Gene Kelly stars as a GI who is based in Paris, he stayed there to paint, soon he is the gigolo of a rich woman. , but he really loves someone else! Hoary sure story, but the musical numbers save the show here! I really loved the voice work of Georges Guetary in this movie. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his duet with Le Gene in 'Wonderful' are wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron, I can take it or leave it. All in all, a good movie, but not a dynamite.
