Not to be confused with Resse Witherspoon's high school film of the same name, this is a stylized look at the triads of Hong Kong. Called the election because a new leader or 'president' is elected by ancient traditions every two years. Two candidates are up to the position and, through ego, bribes and history, the race is tense, to say the least. Skillfully directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever confusing the tale of twists before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. The Asian godfather this is not but it is a nice thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you at the edge of your seat and shuddering with violence. Volume 1 with subtitles I think it's safe to say that there will be other plots as we delve deeper into the dark world of the triads and all their rival, low-cost businesses. Anyway, this is a good start and, if there are no sequences, a great movie by itself.
