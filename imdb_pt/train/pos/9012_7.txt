Imagine the situation of Richard, a painter, whose true passion is to fly. When we meet for the first time, he is seen on top of a London building using his home-made wings. He tore his canvases and other works, at the height of his despair, and creates a flying device for his jump. When he falls into the police protection contraption, he does not suffer a scratch, but puts him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service. Richard, whose relationship with Anne has apparently gone bad, decides to move to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to build his own plane. <br /> Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S., or Lou Gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely intelligent, but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. She uses a handheld device to speak at times, as her speech is not clear. What Jane likes to do is lose her virginity at any cost. Jane and Richard face each other when they meet, but a mutual tolerance soon leaves them at ease. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches pornography on her computer, has an idea of ​​finding someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo." When Richard takes her to London, they find the right man for the job.His rate is exorbitant, but they agree.As they have no money, Richard decides to rob a large bank "In the end, Richard takes Jane for a ride on his crudely constructed airplane to the thrill of his life, something that brings them closer together, as they find an affinity with each other. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass directed this quirky film that presents an unusual situation. <br /> <br /> Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in the mainstream movies, and yet she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and for what she is trying to accomplish.Greengrass shows an affinity for Richar Hawkins's material he wrote for the film.The movie does not try to be cute or give a pink image of a young girl who and suffers from an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason to watch the movie. She makes a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh does not seem very suitable for this type of comedy. Somehow, he has his own problems in the way Richard plays. Gemma Jones has some good times like Anne, Richard's old love. <br /> <br /> "The Theory of Flight" shows a good director. No doubt, Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things.
