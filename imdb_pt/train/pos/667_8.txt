Although I'm a fan of Peter Weir, I did not watch any of his Australian films until watching The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant and unpredictable surprise. Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five Aborigines accused of murdering another Aboriginal. For David's colleagues, it's a clear case of alcohol disorder and they think they should plead guilty and deliver a fast sentence. But David believes there is a mystery under the assassination, linked to tribal rituals. As his research proceeds, he learns not only things about his clients, but about himself as well. <br /> <br /> To reveal more would be to ruin one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one would expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this movie fascinating: Chamberlain's acting, for example; but also the performances of David Gulpilil, who plays a young Aboriginal who introduces David into the tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old Aboriginal who is a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also the way Weir suggests the supernatural in the film. David has dreams that tell him the future. Australia is going through a terrible time, with storms, falling hail and even a mysterious black rain that can be nothing but pollution. But it's also related to the case David is defending. How this is related is one of the great revelations of the film. From small events, Weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without actually showing anything. <br /> <br /> Charles Wain's score is fantastic, especially the use of didgeridoo. The photograph is also very good. Russell Boyd, Weir's longtime DP, who won an Academy Award in 2004 for Master and Commander, portrays a dark and scary world, full of mystery. <br /> <br /> I also find it remarkable that for an Aboriginal-centered film, do not turn it into an accusation against white culture or into a mean celebration of its traditions like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too clever to be simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it can upset viewers who hope to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who do not care about any strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
