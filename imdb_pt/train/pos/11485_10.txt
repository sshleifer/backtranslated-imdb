Zero Day leads you to think, even rethink why two boys do what they did - commit suicide by killing their classmates. He captures what must be beyond a bizarre way of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from ordinary civility to define their own mutual world through joint destruction. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, but rather given the money / time the filmmaker and the actors had - it's a remarkable product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of two young suicide / murderers, it is best that "Elephant" - in terms of being a movie that is under our "rationalist" skin, is a far better movie than anything you are. likely to see. <br /> <br /> Perfect but honest with a terrible honesty.
