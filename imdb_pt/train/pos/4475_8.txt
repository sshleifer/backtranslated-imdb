The United States was still fighting World War II (the movie was released between Victory Day and VJ Day). Any worthwhile studio was making fight movies, where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans generally sang and danced. Technicolor Musicals was what America thrived in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most of the musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers, combined with the best storyline available to fill the time to the next musical number! I get the feeling now that the people who reviewed this movie were born after 1970. Depressing how quickly we forget. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been called "The Search for Jose Iturbi", but now everyone wonder why. Let me explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists to perform at a concert stage. He agreed to make some films in 1942, but Hollywood pursued him for almost a decade at the time. Not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi was a familiar word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturbi and 17 other pianists played one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned from the start - and no one ever noticed that the other pianists were children? Joe Pasternak, who produced the film and many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with America's interesting youth in classical music. Grayson wanting to audition with Iturbi in the film was no different from real life at the time. They all wanted Iturbi back then. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he did many shows on military bases). Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra, an excellent singer, but the time this movie was made Sinatra was only 30 years old and only had contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi was a worldwide sensation for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> And as for the lack of a plot, Americans did not need a plot. They were tired of the war, sick of fear for their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out well in the end. They needed music and smiles and joy and romance. This film and others like it delivered exactly what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lecturing. Rat dancing aside, the best scene of the film takes place between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them "ignorantly" praising the music of the other. <br /> <br /> If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard who has conquered more of America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon together, please go to my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a summary of the plot, snippets of critiques of "daytime" movies and photos of this and some other MGM musicals from the 1940s, plus a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> Trout
