If you like mech war games is very good. Some of them are cheap, but worth seeing the fights between robots. I enjoyed the mech battlefield for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that came close to the feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like the genres then the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and Four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to spare Steel Battalion. The movie is worth seeing at least once. There really need to be a few more films about the same theme out there. Fewer remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
