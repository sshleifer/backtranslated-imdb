One of the best kung fu movies, but not as flawless as I expected, given the brilliant reviews. The film starts off well enough, with the jokes being visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you imagine for that time) and make non-combatable dialogue sequences passable (for a movie of kung fu). a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (following the Jackie Chan police dramas), Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the movie, it takes a melodrama tragedy that I thought was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The action is good, with a duel between Sammo and half of the movie. Only 2 stars of Shaw Brothers, Kar-Leung Lau and then a fight at the end with the taller guy who always plays the bad guy of Jet Li. There is only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but the which bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera pictures. I understand that they have to shoot at half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are soft issues and then there is. This really takes away the struggles when it's obvious the footage was confusing. That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here is not going to dissuade you, and if you do not like it, you just wasted two minutes of your life reading this.
