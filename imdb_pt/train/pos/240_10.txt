Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. It is not a true historical report and not all information should be considered factual information. True Hollywood conventions such as playing a roster and MANY attractive actors such as 'heroes' such as Naed Watts (Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne's right-hand man - Ned), and uninteresting (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police. It also infuses a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to appeal to all romantics, with women being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat young man from drowning and his father calls him "the sun" and has a "sparkle in his eyes as he looks at me, his hand on my shoulder," is very romanticized and convinces. bystanders with Ned Kelly, the loser. Also, do not all Australians love an underdog?
