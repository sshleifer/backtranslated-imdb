"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to stay in history as the last rebel movie party. Portraying a group of high school students using the music of the Ramones as inspiration to stand up against their despotic director (Mary Woronov, of the fame of "Eating Raoul"), the whole movie is a mile per minute. It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you will. Intimidated freshmen? Checks. An idiot music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul")? Checks. Rats exploding? Check Mate. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's the kind of thing that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know the Ramones' music, it's pure pleasure. With Roger Corman, executive producer, and Joe Dante, co-director, how could we expect less? Too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into fare as "Caddyshack II". Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who appeared in each of the films of Joe Dante and many of Roger Corman), Don Steele and, of course , the Ramones. A real treat. <br /> <br /> It seems that Bartel and Woronov have always co-starred. They also co-starred in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they reprized their roles in "Eating Raoul."
