If you have trouble suspending disbelief, this is not for you. Consider: a woman in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and creates it as if it were her own. Think about it; she makes no attempt to locate the mother, who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and apparently no one of the Italian equivalent of Social Services makes any attempt to put the baby in 'care' (without social services? KNOW, it's a fantasy). Before you know it, young Toto is about ten years old and his foster mother dies, leaving him in the orphanage, from which he emerges a happy man who loves everyone. Not at all flat, he not only delivered his suitcase to the man who stole it, but organized the homeless into authentic slum dwellers and, by an encore, led them in a struggle against capitalism in the form of the entrepreneur who buys the land. in which the Favela stands when oil is discovered there. It wants to swallow without the subsequent 'miracles', beginning with Toto's dead mother (the old woman who created it, not biological), appearing to him and handing him a dove that works like a magic wand that allows him to grant modest desires and end where the hobos fly to a better place, presumably located somewhere on the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is up to here with charm and is easy to surrender. In balance, a little masterpiece.
