As other reviewers have noted, this is an unfairly overlooked Depression-era movie. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Let It Go to Heaven, The Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.), it's a tough, well-structured and accomplished movement about people living in a New York slum. . They are grifters, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of good and bad people, with loyalties as complex as any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main among the many admirable qualities of this film is the contrast between the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill, and Trina, by Loretta Young. He speaks hard, physically aggressive and evidently fearless - but Bill is not the character who gives this film his sense of survival. While he bluster, Trina really gets tough (if that term can be applied to such an elegant character). His devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll get up on her own if he wants to leave, or "I'm going to give up on the child if you're happy." Such is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at age 20) as a rather simple character, who does not seem weak or dependent, but a woman who recognizes happiness when she meets her and wants nothing more.
