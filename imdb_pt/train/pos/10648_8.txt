What can I say that was not said about "The Haunting"? It has everything that would make a great photo. Wonderful sets, moody music and sound design to die for were all in place. The script sometimes confuses the mind in such a strange and surreal way. The whole team must have forgotten to read it, maybe because they were too busy creating CG effects and building Gothic sets to realize just how weak the plot was. Each member of the cast gives a dignified performance, though with little conviction for the material at hand. Lili Taylor has more to do while others react mostly to her. But that's it. All I can say is that it was a nice two hours, but you definitely will want more. A lot more.
