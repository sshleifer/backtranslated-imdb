I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could pick up a fifty-dollar noise violation by sneezing after midnight - needless to say, I can easily relate to "O Tenant "by Polanski. <br /> <br /> But I also like the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure if this works out in general - the Polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness, which occupies the last half hour, seems a bit shocking and bizarre. Ebert, for example, was not entirely convinced, and he slapped the movie with a vicious review of a star. But I think individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even if I do not understand the whole movie - what does Egyptology have to do with it, for example? "I still have a general positive impression of that. <br /> <br /> I love the nasty friend played by Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times have I decided to have stupid friends like that instead of any friends! I love the movie scene - the funniest "fun" moment in movie history, I would say. And I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so sexy in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. And she does a great job, as usual. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with the occasional derogatory remarks made about his performance here. Your character must be discreet and thoughtful, so his discreet performance fits. I, for example, found him perfectly understanding - although he missed me a little when he began to dress in a dragged fashion for no discernible reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is obscure. Is slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of life in the apartment - something I've done too much - so I learn. It's funny how all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly such a weird movie becomes deeply meaningful! Definitely worth picking up for pocket change on DVD.
