Silverlake Life, The View from Here, is an absolutely stunning film about AIDS, as well as about a gay love relationship. Some images are in fact difficult to understand, especially when one is gay or fears about AIDS and probably for any sensitive person who watches it. It is not easy to make a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences on not only one but the lives of two people. This film teaches you how to care for each other in difficult times, but never gets too morbid, still shows life at any time, reminding you that outside the theater or your bedroom, life goes on, whatever the fate of some people can be. The characters are incredibly catchy as we watch their intimacy in scenes that never go beyond a very strict limit, never revealing anything very private or offensive. Children certainly should not watch this movie, but adults, whether they have to deal with such situations or not, must do so, and they will not regret the tears they shed.
