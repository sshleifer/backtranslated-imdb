I had heard some not so good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here on IMDb and that is why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do ... and, as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary movie, sad and moving, actually one of the best I've seen for some time. I was amazed at the way I was affected watching. It's hard to explain, but during the film your feelings about the characters and their perception of what's happening changes and it's a very emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you heard about it.
