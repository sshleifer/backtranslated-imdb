Life in (some) colleges. Of course, artistic licenses were taken, but some of the things you saw in this movie happen in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to colleges in Southern California, where races pretty much go around. It's funny because they are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc. and I can honestly say, it's there. But the thing is when the class leaves out, or when they are just waiting for the class, they (students) seem to just stay with people of their own race or ethnicity. This is bad? Not really. Everyone needs a feeling of belonging. But just as the school paper from one of the schools I once participated in wrote about it, "we should all try to walk with students of other ethnicities and try to get to know them." Otherwise, you are creating your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of these schools I attended. Once someone put pamphlets around the campus talking about the glories of the Aryan race and had the symbols of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie in which the young Caucasian man left and started shooting at a multiculturalist meeting. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing like this will happen. <BR> So the "Higher Education" is too dramatic? Exaggerated? Perhaps. Is it an off mark way? It depends on where you went or goes to school. The race thing, where the ethnicities just get their own things happen. Except for the Hollywood hype, the race thing came very close to home for me.
