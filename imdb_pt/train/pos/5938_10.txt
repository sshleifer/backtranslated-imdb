Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman: Dead End that just helps to stimulate our taste buds and leaves us wanting more! This is how a real superhero movie should be and feel! Even hard this is a kind of fan film. Attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although this is a limited production of features, it shames the big budgeted productions, thrown by stars, excited productions "other" films related to superheroes. Here, the main and supporting characters act and seem to be real-life people. Finally, a Superman who really looks "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without the gaudy, rubber-covered body armor to hide the skeletal muscles of the most paid actors who do not deliver. I just wish some sensible CEO of Warner Bros. OK to produce a complete fit of this jewel. I do not care if it goes to theaters or straight to the DVD, I never get tired of watching. Just the plot itself is worth my sweaty batter for it. I hope the "bigwigs" of Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a well-produced superhero movie should have. No more fiasco "Batman & Robin", or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little time directors and know that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just to have it "bombard" theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
