I liked this movie. It was funny, cute, silly and fun. I had a good cast and was actually hammered by some critics for reasons I did not really understand. No, it was not "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a nice film. <br /> <br /> Julia was excellent at interpreting the psychotic "man behind man". The story is a little silly to be sure, but this is not a big drama, folks. Turns out I watched a review of the movie, probably the only good one I got, and then I ran into it one night when I was looking for a movie. I've never heard that it should smell until after I've seen it, and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually I bought the VHS tape in the bargain pile, and I watch it a few times a year.
