Okay this movie as well as I said, but you certainly need to watch as it's worth watching. It is about two boys Mac and Sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the time of laughter begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) begins to date with 3 receptionists at the same time that leaves his wife distrustful. Sam reaches for the fortune and almost forgets his friend, but not quite. But Mac thinks so and so he starts dating with stewardesses. there is garam masala at every step of the movie, rock songs but some things are missing. The comedy is not up to the mark and deserves a prize. It's good, but not so great. Some people laughed until their stomachs ached, but it did not deserve much laughter. But of course everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie, you're welcome.
