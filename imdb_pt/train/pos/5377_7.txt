"The College Girl Murders" is my first contact with Edgar Wallace's work? and usually my first real knowledge with "Krimi" movies in general? and I can say that I am moderately impressed. This stuff is really fun, though I never would have expected it to be like this ?? goofy! The film has a stimulating and very complicated plot, with a good dose of humor, quirky twists and very inventive murders. Is there some kind of bad James Bond mind? who is always in the shade and in front of a big monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison. There is also a villainous monk with a whip, dressed as a communist member of the KKK, getting rid of the characters left over, as overly curious teachers and such, as well as a crazy police commissioner who persists in resolving the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had known before that these Krimi movies were so colorful and crazy, I would have bought a whole collection of them. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than answers at the end, and the overload of comic tricks on Scotland Yard's Inspector Higherins account is sometimes a little too much to swallow, but I do not care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the 1960s soundtrack remained in my head for a long time. It's like a variant of the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
