First, consider that this movie is almost fifty years old! However, it still stands out as one of the great movies of all time. I wonder how many of today's disposable celluloid productions will still be spoken in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple but solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. I still remember the first time I watched this as a kid when the monster enters the force field that protects the ship and you have to see its outline for the first (and only) time. If I had trembled with fear, I can tell you. It seems dated today, but even more than effective enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger show their age now. You can see the contour in which the tiger was matted in the photos with Altaira, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect by which the creature melts through the doors of Krell is done wonderfully. It's also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (best remembered for the Airplane and Naked Gun movies) as a young but still mature. He was 30 when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie that is sure to remain a favorite for years to come. Eternal.
