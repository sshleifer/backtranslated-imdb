If you were born at the time this movie was finished, and had a liberal / open-minded family that I had, I'm sure in the early 80's you would be introduced to your parents watching dirty movies or extremely dirty movies. You know, it's not 100% pornographic, it's an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or that you would infiltrate your collection and appear in the plastic representation of a movie like that on a big machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet and resembling ninjas, but still with a small heart failure when big pop noises were made by pressing the tablet buttons for fear of being discovered. Whatever the case, such films were sent to the back of their mind, waiting and waiting to meet with such visual "art." Needless to say, this movie fits the above-mentioned description for a "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because I am desensitized, I am more disturbed by the subtleties. The creator was talking to us about the deeper levels of human carnality and what might be considered a real abomination, interracial relations, bed masturbation, voyeurism, or could be despair for social status to the point of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality or the repressed sexual nature of socially elitist women in eighteenth-century France? Who can say, but despite the taste of mr. Borowcyzk by a raw and vivid sexuality being the "norm" for his works, I would say that this film really speaks to the viewer on a deeper level about the bestial carnality. Once I learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the vertigo of shock value and thus worth checking out.
