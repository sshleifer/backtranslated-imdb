Director Samuel Fuller invents a brilliant visual setup: an arrogant wallet bender unintentionally picks up some microfilms from a woman's purse; It turns out that she is a messenger of the Communists, and now she and the Griffith are being watched by the police. Film Noir Formula is all its glory - before the ingredients turn into clich√©s - including seafront locations, piccolos, saxophones on the soundtrack and a hell of a climactic fight. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are on target, and the clever and sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulosa Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for supporting role as "professional stoolie." Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** in ****
