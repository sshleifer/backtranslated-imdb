Where Sidewalk Ends is a good movie-noir crime drama and is filmed nicely in black and white and spot on as well. <br /> <br /> A copper accidentally kills a man suspected of murder and protects himself. , he covers it and blames the other person he does not like who has committed many crimes in the past. But in the end, he owns, but not before falling in love with a woman he knows, who is the lover of the person he killed ... The cast includes Dana Andrews (While the city sleeps , "The Curse of the Devil"), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Phantom and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens ). Good parts of all. <br /> <br /> Where the sidewalk ends is worth checking out if you get the chance. Great. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
