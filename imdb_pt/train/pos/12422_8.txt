With the mixed reviews this got I was not expecting much, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a very interesting little crime movie with interesting characters, excellent portraits, unhurried writing and good rhythm. It looks good too, in a fun way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it, and I'm someone who liked it.
