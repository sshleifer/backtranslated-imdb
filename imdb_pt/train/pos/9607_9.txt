This is a movie that should be seen by anyone concerned, affected or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an incredibly accurate and sensitive picture of bulimia in a teenager, its causes and symptoms. The girl is portrayed by one of the brightest young actresses working in the cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies". I would recommend that this movie be shown in every school, as you will never see better on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely remarkable, and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl who suffers from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of precision. Its emotional range is so precise, each scene can be measured microscopically by its gradations of trauma, on a scale of increasing hysteria and despair that reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and she does it with immense sympathy and a range of emotions as finely tuned as Lohman's. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with each other. This film is really an amazing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason not to see is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature movies more, this is after all animal behavior on the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy his own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who suffer from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.
