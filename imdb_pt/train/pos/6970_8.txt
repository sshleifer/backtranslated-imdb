This is one of those movies / pilots that, if you knew BattleStar Galactica, helps, but it's not necessary. What makes this even more believable in a story than BSG is that it is not so far off in the future. This is so deep that it is surprising that it has not been released in theaters. The connections could not have been better chosen in such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united with his daughter, no matter how much it is real or not, and he will do it, no matter the cost. Paula Malcomson of Deadwood's fame is great as is her wife too. You are not sure of your motives, be it love, money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the making of Zoe played by relative unknown Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is fantastic in his desire to see his loved one again and how wrong it is to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think that would be a good idea when it was announced, but only by the pilot I'm thrilled to see how we got to the BSG story. It's great to see Adama as a child already being affected and influenced by the different types of robots beginning to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep the stories so we can find out even more how they got the robots typed by Humanoid. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. Even the visual effects are better than most of the junk you see on the big screen. If you have not yet joined BSG, try this at least and I bet you will become a fan and want to see how the BSG story came about.
