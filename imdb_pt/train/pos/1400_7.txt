Bogmeister and others practically preached this. Shore Leave is really TOS's first attempt at light sci-fi (which they later perfected with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). This gave the crew of the Enterprise and their viewers a necessary respite from the threatening consequences of the universe, for example, The Corbomite Manouever. Looking for a place to relax for a while, the Enterprise happens on a seemingly idyllic M Class planet and sends an exploratory team to take a closer look. Soon all kinds of absurdities begin to happen - some seemingly dangerous - but it all looks like a swamp of human emotional ends thrown into a strange blend of fantastic mystery (McCoy passed by the mirror), psychological thriller (Kirk is chased by a relentless bully of his past), and romantic comedy (without commentary). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all the Trek franchise series, so it's easy to forget how many episodes the first season focused on heavy and potentially dire drama. Unlike the writers of later series franchises, the TOS production team was not afraid to go literally where no TV series had gone before. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly Shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) did not seem to know how to deal with this new wrinkle in ST themes. The last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes I can remember of the entire TOS process - both in terms of composition and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. My recommendation - watch him while watching the entire first season as it was to be seen - order.
