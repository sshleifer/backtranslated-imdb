"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts movies I've had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a boy from the Chinese farm who comes to visit a friend of the town. Just like Tang Lung's "Way of the Dragon." Wherever Sammo goes, the problem begins, so he needs to rely on his martial arts skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly as Bruce Lee does and also releases his shrill scream. It also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There is a major confrontation near the end of the film, which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to find an opponent one by one. More or less like "The Game of Death", where each fighter has a martial art discipline different from one another. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that I really enjoyed watching and also the first Sammo Hung movies I've ever seen. Great fight scenes and lots of laughs. A classic and rare Sammo Hung movie that I recommend to all the martial arts fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
