A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of those blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before normal hours. The old movie does not show how important Biko was, what he really represented. His life and his teaching are reduced to little, at best, some witty remarks. Being the 1987 film, the goal was to push South Africa to the brink of the abyss that would lead to its liberation. The film aims to show how South African apartheid supporters are irrational in 1987. To show this, the film must see beyond Biko's death, to focus his speech not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and on escaping absurd system in which he is living. His escape is necessary because of the victimization with which he is a victim, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book about Biko after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape from South Africa while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this path to be realistic and true. Could not be. But the film has aged tremendously because it does not show South Africa with any historical detachment, the very detachment that took place under the presidency of Nelson Mandela and which is called forgiveness, provided those who want to be forgiven speak and leave. The film is strong and emotional, but this historical limit makes it quite weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. All of Panegyric's books or films have this defect: they are looking at the person they should portray from a single point of view. This explains why the film has aged so much, seems to come from so long ago, as if nothing had changed. A remake is needed. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris University 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines, CEGID
