I saw this movie about a year ago, and found it quite funny for Laugh-Out-Loud. A real winner, in my head. He had the underlining of a stupid comedy, but actually had a real plot too. Much like the hit comedy, Elf, actually. He had some serious moments, sandwiched between hilarity. When Stiller shot Black's horse, a normally sober moment, you found yourself laughing at your clumsy antics. You can find a point in common, since I'm sure many people did something they would not want a friend to find out so that their friendship would not end. <br /> <br /> When I discovered how much people did not like this movie, I was completely stunned. Absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite have had higher ratings than it makes me think about the sanity of the people in IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you are not laughing at least once, I pay the rental fee. = D
