The Old Mill Pond is more a tribute to the African American artists of the thirties than any denigration of the entire race (despite the cartoon of Stepin Fetchit). In addition to those I just mentioned, there are also frog or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies drawing by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is a lot of fun musically with perfect characterizations around. They all sound very much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could be. If not, they are certainly very flattering imitations. Even Fetchit's lazy and restless characterization gets an exciting workout when he is chased by a tiger while "Hold That Tiger" touches the board. Highly recommended for fans of 1930's animation and jazz music.
