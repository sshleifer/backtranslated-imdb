Characters incredibly developed in many funny situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting and unpredictable. Best point in a movie: characters, then humor, story and dialogues. Humor has "inner development", rare in Serbian films. So it is a consequence of the characterization, it is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. She is also sharp, intelligent and lucid. Most movies, unfortunately, built humor (make up a joke and put it in the mouth of a character) or a comedy of common situation, burlesque, farce. Some of the "immortality of art" are embodied in this film. Little masterpiece, difficult to reach.
