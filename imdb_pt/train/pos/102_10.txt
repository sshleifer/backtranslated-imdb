I first heard about this movie about 20 years ago, when I was a kid at school (!), I happened to be leafing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entrance to movies (or movie, I did not I remember), there were several stills for different movies, from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was still for OffOn. This really intrigued me as it stood out more on the page (it was a still from the movie's scene with the eye with other elements superimposed on it). About 18 or so years later, the public library here where I live had available to checkout the entire set of 4 DVDs of "Treasures of American Film Archives" released by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I was reading the notes on the set's DVD boxes, I was pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I finally saw the movie! After seeing it, it was not what I expected (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that it was a bad thing, but I expected it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including the hand-tinting of the film itself, and using the video equipment for some of the movie scenes (shot from a video monitor), giving it a Do not interpret me evil, the techniques used in this film were quite innovative for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me too ...
