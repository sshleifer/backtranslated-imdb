This is the best of the 43 films Rainer Werner Fassbinder has done; its more successful at least. He was one of the leading directors of New Germany after World War II. Hanna Schygulla was magnificent as the cool, calculating Maria Bruan, who lost her husband to the War, found him after she caught an American soldier as a lover, lost him again after he was arrested by she found it at the end. His day and a half of marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together in the end. <br /> <br /> Such is life. Things come and go, and you do the best you can. You can give up or adjust your thinking to survive. Even though Mary adjusted her thinking and done what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which makes the end a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Excellent drama.
