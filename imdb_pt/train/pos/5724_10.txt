Huge chills on the spine! I'm surprised there are people who did not like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and I was still scared! And I've seen hundreds of suspense / horror movies! To cry out loud, I'm 22 !!! I mean, okay, dubbing, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the beginning, hitting you over and over again with relentless, ruthless and terrifying scenes! So many cliches, but none stop to amaze / scare! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump out of the chair. Get a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch him at night! Let's take the hat to the Japanese!
