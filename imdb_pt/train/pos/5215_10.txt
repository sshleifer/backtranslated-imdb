All I can say is, the first film of this season that caught my eye. I chose because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising ... I just watched and I can say - I'm impressed. There are shocking scenes, it's true ... but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and improve things and who are ridiculed by commitment to the cause. In fact, I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard played a great role and deserve 10 of me.
