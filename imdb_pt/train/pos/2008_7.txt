The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work, considering that they did not use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how it happened. As a rule, sequels are never as good as the originals, with some exceptions. Although this was not a great movie, the writer did well to keep the main themes and vampire legends of the first in tact. Jon Bon Jovi was a handicap initially, but he proved to be a decent Slayer in the middle. I doubt anyone can outperform James Wood at first, though ... unless you bring Buffy! <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a decent watch and I watched it again. <BR> I got two questions, though ... what happened to Jack Crow and how Derek Bliss got to be a killer? I think we're going to have to leave that to the imagination.
