Anne Brontes Epic Romance THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read in all the schools, libraries and living rooms of the people. It's a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriages and a struggle of mothers to keep their son away from her brutal husband. It's so much like today's stories that we see and hear and believe that people can learn a lot by reading this book. Based on possible real experiences that the author had in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, it's a great version of the book and very moving. I'm sure Anne would have been happy with the way it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance and great locations.
