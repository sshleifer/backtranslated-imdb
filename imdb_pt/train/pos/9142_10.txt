Purple Rain ... what more can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The movie had a great story. I loved! Since I watched the movie, I got stuck in the 80's and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all his musical compositions, and Apollonia was sitting on the steps with his earring in his hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a novel. Murphy Brown also did a great job on the film, he really acted like himself. I'm so glad I saw this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so sincere. I cried more than once.
