It's one of the best films I've seen in the last 2 years (I saw the prime minister in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, just when the last war began ...) This problem in communication between people, which cause wars, have been of interest to me for a long time, and it does not matter who are boys and girls, heterosexuals and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen the Bubble already 3 times, and it's still surprising and exciting, my character reminds me of one of many people I know, and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw this - it was with my friend, who is an Arab Christian, and it was on Israel's Independence Day. more symbolic I could! how ironic) and ... he cried in the end !!! - if he was touched and not ashamed - everyone would be touched by the bubble!
