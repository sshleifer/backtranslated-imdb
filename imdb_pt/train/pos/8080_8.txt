Well, I get used to it after some time reading reviews about those movies that do not reflect my experience. To me, Amitabh was a better villain than in some of his most famous films. He was a stubborn villain, a villain with no excuses. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy is not some kind of demotion in some way. <br /> <br /> The boy who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. I think maybe the director did better. But to be honest, the best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unknown heroine, a true veteran who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I must say that I greatly appreciated his contribution in interpreting Virendra Sahi's wife. She may have little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she passed right through most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the habit of making do with the Bollywood average, you will not get much of that movie. But if you constantly look for something else, this can give you a bit of what you are missing out on.
