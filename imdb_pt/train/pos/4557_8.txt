I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazing as the young Christy Brown, and really deserved more recognition for his role. I could not believe how well he played the part. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where the boys are playing football and Christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty! Surprising performances by the two Christys (and others too).
