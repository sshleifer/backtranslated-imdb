Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second on-screen pairing (after the classic Alfred Hitchcock Vertigo, released the same year). This was Stewart's last film as a romantic call, since he was considered too old at age 50 to play that kind of part. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted to a mortal played by James Stewart. She puts a spell on him and he falls madly in love with her. I liked the movie and the cast. This film at the time was a moderate success that was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Comedy Film. GimmeClassics
