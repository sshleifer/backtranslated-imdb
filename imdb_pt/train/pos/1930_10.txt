This movie is hilarious, original and beautifully directed. I became a groupie of BIG BAD SWIM, accompanying her to film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I've seen it about half a dozen times now, and each time, the enthusiastic response from the audience has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best movies to be released in years. In almost every festival that was shown, it sold out or won the favorite audience award. Of course people love this movie and even more clearly why they do it. The cinematography is superb, the characterization and performance brilliant, the ending fantastic, and the direction full of compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It's hard to believe this is Ishai Setton's first film. I hope it will be released soon for all to see.
