I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a 1968 film? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was filmed entirely in black and white, I knew my erotic hopes were thwarted. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! This film not only has all the elements of a smoking romance - the discovery of first love, the fear of the secret discovered, a sudden unexpected end - but sometimes this movie was frankly erotic. You will soon forget that it is filmed in black and white. Cinematography deserves all the praise it has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. Okay, so they're in their twenties trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect the teenagers of the 60s to effectively explore a lesbian love story like that? Many adult women still tried to deal with their sexuality at that time. Anyone who is looking for real teens here is expecting a lot. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; however, still managed to leave much to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what was shown to us. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you heterosexuals who love watching lesbians in action: While not everything you expect, I do not think you'll be disappointed.
