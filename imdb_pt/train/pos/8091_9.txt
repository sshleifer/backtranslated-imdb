The versions of Peter Jacksons are better films from the objective point of view. That said, they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters' acting on the screen is very common and uninspired with Jackson's LOTR. The whole cast is very run of the mill. "Are you claiming that these silly characters from Ralph Bakshi's version are better actors than real people?" No one could ask. Well, they are not really silly (except for Hobbits, later on about them) and they certainly have more personality than Jackson's party - even with a much more limited dialogue time. And this is because of Bakshi's superior LOTR performance. Take Aragorn for example. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic, full of authority (Aragorn, sir) and with a thick temperament (Aragorn, the ranger). This is due to the brilliant performance of John Hurt's voice. Compare this to Viggo Mortensen's rather high-pitched, soulless sound, and the duel is quickly unbalanced: Hurt hits Mortensen's hands. <br /> <br /> And then there's Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the entire saga. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) is a true magician. And with that I do not mean that he shoots arrows from his fingertips (he does not), but his presence is just captivating. He is a mystic, powerful and can change from gentle old man to a scary person with ease. Add to that his appearance: tall, old as old oak, long beard as his body, sharp eyes, magical hook nose and, of course, the classic wizard's hat. A Perfect Gandalf, just like in the books. Gandalf, by Ian McKellen, on the other hand, is just plain annoying. He seems too human, seems too human, acts too human and does not wear a hat or does not wield his sword. Yes a sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf marks two bloody orcs with his sword (as he did in the books). And those are sleek slow-motion deaths. Gandalf is not a power to be confused. And it should be noted that although I am sad to say this, the great Christopher Lee did not bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr in this movie did, even with a screen time and very limited lines. Before moving completely into visual aspects of the film, it should be mentioned that the dubbing and general presentation of the Orcs film are also superior to Jackson's passive stray. Bakshi's orcs tease their enemies (or each other) constantly with snarls, screams and unpleasant language. They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. And finally, the Black Knights - or the Nazgulls. These final thugs are scary ghosts in this - not just some black-wearing pilots. And they speak with a scary voice that hypnotizes their victim. My favorite scene in the movie is when the Nazgulls are chasing Frodo by the river. While Peter Jackson could not do anything but show the pilots that they were just chasing the party, Bakshi was launching a nightmare dream with some cool scenes in slow motion and a thundering sky. <br /> <br /> But I like this movie as much as Jackson's, the latter, although technically, are still better. And this is because of some key visuals. As you know, Bakshi LOTR features a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered in paint. I really have no problem using real people in animation that way, but they just do not fit very well with traditional cartoon figures. This is especially true with humans (Rohan's Knights, tavern people, etc.). Orcs are different subjects since they are made to look very distinct from other characters. Orcs, while played by humans with animation mix, look far superior to the Jacksons version. They have greenish brown skin, bright red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The greatest damage to visuals, howerver, is the Hobbits. While I prefer almost all the characters in the Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshi, you get some annoying and poorly designed humanoid bamboo from Disney. And you're forced to spend a lot of movie time with them, so be warned. Again, dubbing is also good for them, but the actors' mouths can not save the "immersion damage" done by these little weasels. Well, I never really liked those halflings anyway. <br /> <br /> General failures in Bakshi writing are well known. Limited playback time (on a limited budget) and many missing scenes. So while this movie covers almost half of the story, it does not do this in detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In summary, Ralph Bakshi's version of LOTR has a superior: <br /> <br /> - general atmosphere (looks more like Middle-earth) - all kind of voice acting - music (I really listen to Kont & Rosenman's score) - Gandalf -Aragorn (One of John Hurt's best roles) -King Theoden - Orcs - Black Riders - Ellrond (He's not a fairy hippie!) /> While Jackson's version is better: <br /> <br /> - because it covers the whole story - visuals and special effects in general - Gollum / Smeagol - Balrog - Hawbits <br /> Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, even with its well-known flaws, is one of the best animated films ever made and captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world, if not perfectly. I'll give you a score of 8Â½ out of 10.
