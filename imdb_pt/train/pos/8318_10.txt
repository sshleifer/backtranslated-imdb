An excellent movie. Excellent performance by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and the young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role of satin. This film was one of the last predominantly "all black" films of the 1970s and, unlike the "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie had a plot and was very well done. The soundtrack to the film, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R & B charts at the time.
