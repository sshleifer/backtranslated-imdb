Hidden Frontier is a fan made show in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager returns from the Delta quadrant. There are some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original to the show. The show takes place at the base of Deep Space 12 stars and on various spacecraft, which gives it opportunities that the official shows do not have. The characters have the opportunity to climb the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship do not own. The show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the performance takes place in front of the green screen and gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do well. The episodes are directed by characters and the characters develop over several episodes. That's a bit more like Babylon 5 than it is at official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier picks up taboos that even the official series has shrunk to use. All in all I enjoyed watching.
