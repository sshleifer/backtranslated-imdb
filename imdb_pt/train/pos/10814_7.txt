Given the opposite circumstance of 2009, where the reality is that we have a black president, this film assumes a powerful historical significance. For entertainment value, I found this movie interesting and disgusting. I was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time, but I also found the music and dance incredible. It's also very cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a boy who is being comforted by his Mama. It is said 'Why could you ever be president'. This was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was ridiculed and considered captivating, charming and funny. Most of the film is a fanciful sequence of what the government would be if it were directed by a black man. They describe the headquarters of the government as being like a revivalist Baptist church. <br /> <br /> The fact was that when I stumbled into this movie one day it attracted me. It's very well done and so much fun. I believe that if we can see beyond racism, we can see this film for everything it brings us. In fact, realize that it is not only ridiculous to have a black president, but that this is normal, just makes this film much more relevant. This clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
