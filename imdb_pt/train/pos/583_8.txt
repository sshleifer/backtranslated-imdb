In a small town in Montana two brothers grow up. One is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with their lessons that have to do with religion and the lessons of fly fishing. In this movie, fly fishing represents life a little. <br /> <br /> The story is good and holds your attention, although there are some times when you need some action. Probably the movie has these moments because it's not really about the events that happen, but about the message. Some things happen though. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years he returns and engages with a cool girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and he is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul has become a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter". He is famous and seems to have a good life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, has a good score and all the actors are Good. The most beautiful thing about this movie is cinematography. The mountains, the woods and the river look very beautiful. If the film was made just for these things, it was good enough to watch. Fortunately there is more.
