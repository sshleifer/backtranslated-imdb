The story and the music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and this thing is a good protagonist. Sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Anyway, despite it, the plot moves very well with the famous (and deservedly) ballet. Oh the colors, the gorgeous red, blue, green and yellow. Do not forget the beges too. ; I love the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (full black and white costumes) and the ever-so-brilliant Ballet. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose what I am trying to say is: Please, by all means see it and enjoy it, because although it is not the best, it is wonderful. But make sure you do not forget that other Gene Kelly musical with the 20-year-old who was catapulted into stardom soon after.
