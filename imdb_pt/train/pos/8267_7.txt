Brown from Harvard is a difficult film to define. We expect a lot more from our films these days, so it's good to remember that the public in the 1920s was a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble in pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the relationships in the film seem very complicated, EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the city nerd. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sports ... It's a great education in how society has changed in the twentieth century.
