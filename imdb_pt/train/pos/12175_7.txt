What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a Hawaiian boy's bar? All sailing until he takes off his "single hat." What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl were the cousin of your finances? A new bass, right? Well, Paul Coleman, comically interpreted by Jason Lee, leads that experience from a nauseating blur and a new low. I have to say that this is one of your good lead roles. However, I believe his role in Vanilla Sky was best represented. <br /> <br /> Her financially named Karen is played by actress Selma Blair, while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented. Julia Stiles. Going back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with a problem that arises for another. He gets sick, has to deal with certain people, and has to play his lies with stealth or any member of each of the families can get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who did not have a "bowel movement" . "for 14 days. * Vomiting * All this leads to the long-awaited wedding with a hilarious scene before recapturing the hell that Paul and his brother had to go through. Overall, Guy Thing is very funny And if you're a Canadian and a fellow fan of the CTV sitcom Brett Butt, Corner Gas, it's all right. Sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie. , you would recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays hanky Hank in the series.This movie is fine.It is another pity on Lee's hat (a rather empty hat until now, though). <br /> My evaluation: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
