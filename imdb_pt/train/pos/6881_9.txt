How can a movie that features Curtis Mayfield's singing be bad? Can not! Groove Tube is a series of eschatological sketches that scoff at everything from 2001 to the Olympics. The highs, (Koko the Clown, the easy lubricant recipe) outweigh the lows (a long too long "The Dealers"), but even the lows are funny. Best of all is the manic dance of Ken Shapiro on a bustling Manhattan sidewalk (which is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Definitely dated now, but back then the Groove Tube was flippant, bold, unashamed and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this cult minor success, so 7 years later made Christmas Day opening, Modern Problems (although I have liked it) and since then unfortunately nothing (he could be playing drums in a jazz group) The Groove Tube continues to be an endless explosion of positive energy, a film that 26 years after my first viewing, still brings me a real joy!
