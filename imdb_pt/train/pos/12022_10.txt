As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie like a plague when bad reviews started appearing eight years ago, but I just watched this movie and found it to be a very pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you're looking for a retread from the original, you're in for a big disappointment, but if you're looking for something completely different, a little bold and political then this is the movie for you. Gregory is now thirty-four years old and works as a teacher in his old school where he is being chased by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams with one of his students. When the student insists on meeting Gregory, a number of misadventures happen, including torture, invasion and invasion, and all sorts of unexpected twists that have left me thrilled and moved. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something original then I highly recommend this movie. I just wish more people had come to see this when it was released and seen for what it really is.
