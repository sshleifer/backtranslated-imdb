A Chinese ghost story is starring the late and great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a tax collector who decides to spend the night in a desert temple where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce the victims by an evil spirit that feeds on chi (vital force), he decides to try to free the girl by giving her an appropriate burial. With the help of Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling successfully defeats the tree spirit, but also must fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, whom Tsing should marry. The first Hong Kong movie I saw that was not purely for martial arts, A Chinese Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy terror, a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts innocent heroes, sword wielding Taoist monks, monstrous spirits, and black lords of the underworld; I instantly fell in love with the film's exuberance, energy, humor, inventiveness, and visual excellence. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, is this incredible film still one of the best examples of its kind I've seen? A sumptuous and dazzling work of art that brilliantly combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With superb Siu-Tung Ching direction, excellent editing by David Wu, stunning cinematography and a host of imaginative special effects (including a huge killer language, a monster of tentacles and several flying heads!), A Chinese Ghost Story is a experience completely unforgettable and very enjoyable from start to finish.
