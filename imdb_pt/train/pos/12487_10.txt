Dark Remains is a simple and simple home run. The movie is full of creepy, freaky visuals that will make the seasoned veteran of terror jump out of the chair. The stair scene in particular, these guys are good. Although they are not working on a huge budget, everything looks good, and the actors go by. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings that may be negative for some, but I think that makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are in place as the mourning couple trying to rebuild there lives, however, some minor characters like the sheriff have not convinced me. They are not that important. I give Dark Remains a perfect ten note for being ten times more frightening than any recent studio / Japanese remake ghost story.
