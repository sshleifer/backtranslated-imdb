We often see movies about undesirable things happening in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role that he was born to play, Al Pacino star as Mayor of New York who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. But it turns out that nothing he actually does will have any effect. In this movie, the characters are as brave as one would expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust any politician, you may have your doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not cite any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays, but that is not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this movie will overturn these ideas. Certainly one I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
