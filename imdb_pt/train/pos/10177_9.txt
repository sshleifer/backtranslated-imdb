'De Grot' is a fantastic Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was transformed into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'The Vanishing' in 1988. This is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called ' The Vanishing '), but sometimes comes close. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening moments are great. We see a man, then we learn that his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his suitcases, it's clear he's smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted upon. A type of suspense is created that you would not normally have in an opening scene like that. Later, we see how Egon makes his agreement in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like that. <br /> <br /> From this point, the film is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a boy played by Benja Bruijning). We learned how they grew up as friends, more or less, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon, meanwhile, goes to college and sits with a woman. Around this time, he sometimes meets Axel, but does not really want anything with him. <br /> <br /> The film is somewhat chronological. He shows Egon and Axel as children, than as students, young adults and in their early thirties. But, from time to time, as I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as children, this explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Which means spoilers here. <br /> <br /> The title means "The Cave", and it is the cave. this gives the film a happy ending, although it's not really that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is fantastic. The middle part of the movie is fun and somehow distracts our attention from the first scenes, only to go back to that point at the end. It's the issue that gives the film a happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is also somehow happy.
