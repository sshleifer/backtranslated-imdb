Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she was ridiculed for doing too many accent roles, but she sings the accent every time. Her acting as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as pictured here, was not particularly pleasant nor so clever. But that only makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think she's worth all 10 of her Oscar nominations. About the movie, well, there were some interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious fanaticism among the general public played a major role in history. I missed that a lot when I first saw the film a few years ago, but it came out loud and clear yesterday. And it seems that the Australian press is as successful in the painless and excessive pursuit as its American counterparts. A good movie. A little different. Serie B
