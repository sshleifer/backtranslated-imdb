This is a very interesting film. It's an action movie with mixed comedy. Foxx joins the comedian Epps in this movie for a comedic twist. This will keep you wondering what will happen to Foxx next. It was a well filmed film, the director used the right colors in this film (dark blue colors) to give the right kind of sensation. Kimberly Elise also starred in this film and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. It plays its part well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing that you have not seen it. Definitely worth it if you are a fan of Jamie Foxx. It deserves more credit than it really is given.
