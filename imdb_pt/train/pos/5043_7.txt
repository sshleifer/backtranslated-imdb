A very promising debut in the direction of Bill Paxton. A very dark / thriller that really made it recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong and well-conceived tale of terror about a devout but demented man in Thurman, Texas, who makes a series of murders after receiving orders from God to eliminate the demons that try to control mankind. A couple of twists and a sinister ending makes your money worth it. Most of the violence you do not really see, but still is enough to bend your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the distorted man to be known as the Killer of the Hand of God. Matthew McConaughey is equally impressive as the eldest man's eldest son who ends up telling this story to an FBI agent in Dallas (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Knuckler white suspense! Highly recommended.
