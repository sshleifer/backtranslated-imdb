When I started to watch "Fay Grim", I had no idea it was a continuation of "Henry Fool". Now the latter was not a movie that I imagined as having a sequel. But one arrived and is very good. I assume you have seen the original, so I will not explain. This begins with Fay (Parker Posey) living with his son she had with the deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day, the son is expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But this is not an ordinary toy. He holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first film. And that secret is deeper in geopolitics than "Syriana." <br /> <br /> I must say that I am quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has accomplished here. Perhaps this does not achieve the quality of the original, but certainly takes a good look at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves open the possibility of another continuation. <br /> <br /> Also starring Jeff Goldblum.
