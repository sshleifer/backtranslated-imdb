This is a movie that I can watch over and over and never get bored of it, it has lots of laughs, guns, action, crime, good liners and a decent storyline, with an exaggeration, Donald Sutherland in a rather comical role as an Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as sexy as ever and can act as well, Thomas Ian Griffin is great at it as the protagonist "Max", DEA agent Diane is FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow, of Frazier on TV, plays the bad face ", Livingston". The plot revolves around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for their respective agencies, throw Assassin Sutherland into the mix, which pretty much has all the good liners, this is O Perfect crime, there is the usual love story, but played much different than you would think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian Mafia, the Italian Mafia and the Chinese Mafia here played in the mix, the movie is filmed in Boston where you have great photos, and locations, great photography and music in this movie, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy, has everything one could want. Check out Sutherland's bathroom in a particular scene, very unusual. this movie is a riot and will make you laugh a lot more for me.
