This is a great movie. The cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. The film is basically about a successful doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to their home. Once the bodies are in his house, he removes things (I hate to use such a general term, but I forget what he was removed) and puts on his wife to keep her youth. Then a reporter, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers about why the brides were dying. She makes a trip to the doctors' house and interesting things begin to happen. Definitely watch this oldie, but goodie if you can.
