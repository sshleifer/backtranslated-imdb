Maybe Disney was waiting for another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story and although Angela is charming, she was a very different artist from the great Julie Andrews. Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance. There is something delightfully delicious about her character and she gets a wonderful support from David Tomlinson. Tomilinson may take a song, but he certainly is not much chop as a singer. It does not matter that he was such a talented actor that you do not even notice. There are great appearances from beloved stars of the past, like Roddy McDowel, who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea, who does very little, but it's good to see the old girl again. It's also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the English television king Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The salt sea and The age of not believing. The large number of Portabello Road is on the edge, but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects seem a little clich√© today, but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the film's wildest army is quite impressive. Kids are not as annoying as other movies, but a struggle to understand what the younger boy is saying. I loved the marching music of the original army. The housekeeper was very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute. The animation is delicious, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. A happy and hot movie and a wonder is not done on stage.
