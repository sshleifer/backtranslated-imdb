Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I want to say that nothing can live up to the biggest Christmas movie ever, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is so good and has so many messages, I cried while watching. Seriously, this is one of those movies that you need to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch being informed that he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sadness, and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream? Is it implying that we as humans are treating the ice cream so well when all it does is do us harm? Think of film makes you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best interpretation of Santa Claus of all time. Unlike other dads, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on children's dreams, and we wonder; Is Santa Claus we really believe so good? Also, this Santa Claus actually mentions Christ, all the meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece. We should stop making movies and nothing more than this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. Whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.
