Mario Lanza, of course, is "The Great Caruso" in this 1951 film starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictional biography of the legendary tenor of world renown, whose name is known today. <br /> <br /> The film is produced opulently, and the music is gloriously and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna. , Blanche Thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you are a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the "Lucia" sextet will seem strange to you - even if Caruso's wife, Dorothy, has just had a girl. It is also highly improbable that Caruso sung Edgardo in Lucia; the paper was too loud for him. <br /> <br /> By taking a dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are in the standard repertoire today, but this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "Girl of the West". There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a robe. The reason for this photo? His only shirt was in the laundry room. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later, RCA Victor). He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco on the night of the earthquake. <br /> <br /> Instead, the history of MGM basically made him die on stage during a Martha performance, which never happened. He had a hemorrhage during "L'Elisir d'amore" at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times in the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role in the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when she says on the screen "suggested by Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband," it was suggested. What is true is that Dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage, and left $ 1 of his huge property. They also had a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However, Caruso had four other children for a mistress before marrying Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Lanza's voice is very similar to Caruso's, but they only hear Caruso sing in the movie "Match Point" - Caruso's voice is remarkably different from that of Lanza. In fact, for his sound, if he wanted to, Caruso could have sung like a baritone. He is believed to have had some problem with high notes, plus evidence of baritone inclinations; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor, which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to the history of cinema, popularizing opera music. He sings the song in "The Great Caruso" with a sturdy energy; he's really here at the peak of what would be a short career. His acting is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and starts singing a little alone. <br /> <br /> Really a movie for opera lovers and for the fans of Lanza, who are probably one and the same.
