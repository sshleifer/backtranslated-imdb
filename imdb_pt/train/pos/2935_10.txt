Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you've ever seen in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I garethte you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1hr. 45 minutes, and all that time, there was only one moment when I was not laughing. You'll laugh for hours after you've finished, repeating the repeated phrases over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many funny performances throughout his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Police Officer, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far his most HILARIOUS . I've seen this movie so many times, and it's more fun all the time. It never loses its advantage. From this day on, all major stand up performances will be imitated from Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
