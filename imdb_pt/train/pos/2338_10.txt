Many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been tried. This may be true, but adding the narrator and Dr.Suess as a scenario makes this program mandatory. With insinuations of adults throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is both reminiscent and invigorating. The investigative part of the show is not what drags the viewers. The twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this paradise are what keeps loyal viewers coming back for more. This is a success that ABC should never let. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old, way to revitalize prime time. 9 episodes before the writers left the public wanting more.
