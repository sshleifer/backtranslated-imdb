Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is on the verge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life - especially involving a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers), whom she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some really terrifying moments. Despite the fact that this is about a teenager and has a PG-13 rating, this is not for kids. Also, if you hate fantasies stay away. But if you like something different, this fits into the design. <br /> <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with a beautiful soundtrack and some scary moments. The only thing that prevents this is really a great movie is Burke - she's not a very good actress (not surprisingly this was her only movie) and it hurts the movie. However, everyone is great. <br /> <br /> Spiers is very good as Mark; Glenne Headley (faking a British accent very well) is also very good, since Anna's mother and Ben Cross are scary and friendly as Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A success when it was released in 1988, has since disappeared. This is very bad - it's really very good.
