This was a movie I had heard all my life while growing up, but I had never seen it until a few years ago. His reputation really proceeded. I knew Michael Myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all the crummy sequels that followed. But I was growing up during the decade when Jason and Freddy had deadly control over the horror game, and I never thought much about the Halloween franchise. Boy, how was I being fooled with cheap knock offs. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly terrifying movie. Now, by today's standards, it's not so graphic and visceral, but this movie meets all the other levels that most horror movies can not reach today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so scary, and the fact that it is located in a picturesque Midwestern town is a testament to its ability. The lighting effects are terrible, with "The Shape" seemingly appearing and disappearing in the shadows at will. Simple but brutally effective music only increases suspense. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well done, with specific nods for Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so nice and vulnerable. It's even more scary when she's being chased by Michael Myers because the director and the viewer have invested so much in her, we want her to survive and leave. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis as a man on a mission and works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the situation in which the city finds itself, because it knows what evil pursues its streets. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not just Halloween a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and attracts the public and never gives up. This should be a standard preview for anyone who wants to experience a truly scary movie. And for an even more frightening moment, try to watch yourself with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see "The Shape" lurking in the shadows!
