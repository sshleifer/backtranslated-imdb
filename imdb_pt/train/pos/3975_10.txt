If you lived the 60's, this movie can be sometimes painful and other times very joyful. It's all there, except for the small print in the prevailing tabloids of counterculture at the time. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still unfolding: "Do not speak too soon for the wheel to turn, for the times are changing." While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its dissemination at the time, this alone played a tremendous role in the evolution of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists, and aiding in the overdevelopment of computer-related activities. A greeting to the filmmakers of who was there - you captured the era better than I have ever seen before.
