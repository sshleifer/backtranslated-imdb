The tweedy teachers-types thought they had everything planned. Today's people living in Polynesia descend from migrating Asiatics, moving boldly from the Far East, island to island, to the east, to Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the established thinking did not fit the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation were true, how do some people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art, and physical characteristics similar to those of Asia but South America? How does the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look so much like what you would find on the island thousands of miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the Islanders point out to the sea toward South America and tell them where did their ancestors, led by Tiki, come from, the equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how do the Norwegians speak of the Scandinavian predecessors who were persecuted from the South American continent they colonized and, along with some of the native peoples who made friends, set out for the sea - towards the WEST? It's too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an incredible amount of moxie, a handful of crewmembers and the local know-how for the traditional construction of rafts, an expedition begins. It is as much a trip to the human imagination as a pseudoscientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the very foundations of tools and seamanship. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in its tone and anglo-ethnocentric approach but rises with an adventure spirit that surpasses even the space program that was launched a decade later, since men are willing to risk everything to test a theory that they think is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an incredible page-turner and the perfect setup for the movie in the newsreel style.
