By the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not yet a jazz fan. There is an exhibition going on until the end of June in the new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, not to be missed, with nine special jazz animation films, including the famous PHANTOM LADY drum sequence. I've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their appearances in movies, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie. That was some progress, since in most of his other appearances he was KILLED (especially in THE BIG SLEEP, by Howard Hawks). 2. Krupa probably dubbed PL Cook. I was able to recognize his style, since he had graduated from the tom-tom used (and abused) early in his career - in 1937, following the SING, SING, SING of the 1937 Hollywood Hotel - and eventually got everything that it was possible to call in French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence of PL, at least as shown in the Museum, is not censored.harry carasso, Paris, France
