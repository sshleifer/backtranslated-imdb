Oh, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the movie world. I really enjoyed the movie because of the intricate plot, the varied characters and the intense camera effects. I saw some complaints about camera work, and in fact, according to the creators themselves, flashy and wild shots were the culmination of mistakes made over time. All you see is the effect you want. Some may complain that something like this has never been done before, although it is what sets it apart. In a deeper aspect, what you're seeing is exactly how Domino sees things through your eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, I do not see anything bad about it. Despite being a "messy" nature, according to some, it's actually just a quick way to tell stories. The plot really is not that hard to follow if you really focus on what is happening. Maybe it's just me because I see films from many different aspects like acting, plot, etc. I'm not "interpreter" or anything that separates movies, this just comes to me. With that being said, I believe this is an excellent movie despite the future as a cult classic, blockbuster, or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, well, there is no doubt about the variety of the cast. I believe the cast is great because they all do good works portraying their characters effectively, it's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and one advantage is that you can witness a small piece of each of their lives, further separating them. Basically, I personally loved the cast and the characters. <br /> <br /> All those who spoil and burn this movie may not see it as I do, or simply do not attract it. No matter, this is a great movie by itself, no, it's a great period of movies.
