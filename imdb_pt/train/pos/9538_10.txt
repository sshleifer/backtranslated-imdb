Why are not there more movies (especially Americans) more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am accused of "electric ecstasy" after having chosen "Meatball Machine" as my first effort. This is a review, so I will try to keep the mere reflection and emotion. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative work, though clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So if it's not all original? I own both movies and although Tetsuo is a strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be felt without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify the meaning of the movie. The meatball machine is as elaborate in history as in the high flow of blood and blood. Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema! Simply put, the last time my dreams were invaded by visions of horror came after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was about 7 years old. I could imagine in my dreams a tongue coming out of a phone for weeks on end. This time (at age 31), my dreams were pleasantly inspiring. <br /> <br /> In this film, human bodies house aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their eternal sacrifice for human flesh and blood. Humans become cyborgs eating meat !!! Have more!!! Fight scenes !! Good music!! Great point of view shots! Decent acting for the Cyborg woman (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen at the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to have friends to watch this movie again just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family will not understand Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not prepared for the Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife came in while I watched the fight scene at the end and she was speechless. Usually it says something like "why are you seeing this crap?" This time she had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not rubbish. This is not just SPLATTER (splatter because of splatter is also great). This is the art my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
