Historical drama and maturing story involving free people of color in the pre civil war of New Orleans. It starts slowly, but takes steam after learning about the main characters and the actual action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. They may not have all the rights of whites, but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. The boys and girls of this story must make their own choices about how to live their lives, whether it's to deprave the system or live optimistically and contribute to their community. I liked all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
