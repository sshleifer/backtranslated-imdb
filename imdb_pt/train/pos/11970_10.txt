Full House came to me when I was about 9 years old. I remember seeing reruns of America's Funniest Home Videos with Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me that he was also at a show called Full House. One day, I was lucky enough to watch an episode while visiting family. It did not seem very interesting at first, but as I watched more and more, every night at 9:00, I just said that. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there. yourself, go out with the girls, go places with them, and maybe even join your little family "cantigas." <br /> <br /> What I like most about Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults, then parties meant for kids, so the whole family will enjoy themselves. No matter how tacky it may be, it's still a great show, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
