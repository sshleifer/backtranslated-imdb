I read some previous comments stating that this movie loses its strength at the end of the movie and also that it has a similar end to Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'm going to give a simple review to normal viewers out there. I thought the cast was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris' best performances. What a bad psycho !!! I have a lot of respect for your acting after seeing your performance in this movie. I've been riveted throughout this movie. If you like mysterious thrillers, then it's definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of stars and I recommend it!
