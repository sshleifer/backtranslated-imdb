Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only to post a comment on this great movie. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that drew me to this movie is Matt. lillard, granted most people probably, or thinks he's too caffeine happy or just sucks, but both are the same age and the same generation and I've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few films in which he is the big and main type of star as in SLC Punk, another great film Lillard. <br /> <br /> Baiscally this is storywise your usual assault movies, but with more twists than anything, they start to turn into madness. Also very notable in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a person greatly appreciated in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a freshman and she's not that bad, although you know they hired her mainly because of her accent and the nudity scene =) <br /> <br /> It's a jack vs jill vs. bob game as each wants to reap the rewards but not share with anyone. Everyone tries to get each other to kill each other and it's a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true courage as the intriguing JAck who initially initiates the whole scheme. Vincent and his wife play with two art thieves who need money due to lack of business. Vince's character is a little insane and skitz throughout the movie, but that only increases the intensity of the movie. <br /> <br /> The surprises on the left and right are welcome and the ending is not cliche and makes you feel happy well, maybe it depends on the kind of ending you like. This film made me very interested, plus the fact that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes movies. The critics probably will not like this movie, but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway.
