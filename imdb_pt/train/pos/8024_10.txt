When I first saw this movie in the 1980s, I was in my mid-teens and reluctant to see it ever since I considered myself grown out of the Sesame Street / Muppets era. I honestly do not remember if I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college I watched this movie again, and ended up going (and staying) in my personal collection of Best Films Ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is LOADED with humor that goes far beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, of course, the Muppets have always appealed to adults and children because there is humor directed at both generations. But come on ... Janice is accidentally overheard telling someone, "I do not take my clothes off for anyone, even if it's artistic" ... there's a joke from a father to a son to his son in love with Caco the Frog, in then the father does not want to hear ... Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and then says "I think we're engaged now" ... these and many other moments in the movie made me roll . Add to that very clever dialogue, the clever New York / Broadway wink wink humor, the usual amount of celebrity appearances, and some really nice songs that do not border on "child-level playwrights" ... this movie is a masterpiece! I do not play "10" regularly ... but this one deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film stays totally, maybe even longer. The Muppets never were and will never be again, as funny and clever and simply brilliant as this movie was and is. --- Q
