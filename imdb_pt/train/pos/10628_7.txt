despite the occasionally flamboyant acting and "all-before-seen" history, this is a pretty compelling film. <br /> <br /> It has suspense, the scenes with the demon are actually quite scary, some of the visuals the effects are superb and best of all, no ridiculously misplaced humor to slow the movie, since many films <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the best movie ever made, but it actually draws you and at least makes an attempt to develop the character <br /> <br /> I I was happy to have attended
