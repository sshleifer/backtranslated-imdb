After having seen many Greek movies, I feel very suspicious against most of them. But after watching this, I was amazed. Movies are great without a big try. You can not say that the script is so good or the picture is perfect or something technical. It's a real story and it's happening in Greek rural areas in forgotten places of God. The film is like a punch in the stomach and I really wish things were not like that. He obviously talks about the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) for anything different. This guy's problem is not that he's an ex-convict. Trouble is, he's not one of those people. He is different and they do not want them (that's why all the good things he does turn into boomerang for him). And also talks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are against the king's hunting, but they do not dare to say their opinion. In the end, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of society being religious and trying to act as God says, but at the same time acting so unfairly with the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end, you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to remain different and alone, you are lost (and not far from reality). I think it's tragic that the story is real and that this is a sign for everyone. No comment for the lead actor, because he already received a prize and I believe that his piece was great. Small comment for Hatzisavvas (he plays the cop), he's like a dinosaur, he's played many roles and I'm sure that role for him was very easy but he plays so well that you can not deny him a big bravo. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
