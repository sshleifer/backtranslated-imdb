I do not know if it contains spoilers or not, but I do not want to run the risk of being blacklisted until the year 3462. <br /> <br /> I do not entirely agree with the comments of the viewers who have described it • Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". They can not have watched the same series I did. The series I attended witnessed the history of European colonization in the Americas and South Africa without any particular imprecision. I did not see anything in the series that portrayed the Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, although Europeans were often lucky - and there is nothing wrong with luck. Nor have I seen native peoples portrayed as innocent little things. If anything, the Inca was quite arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be dealing with foreigners if his country was not conquered in living memory by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly did not see anything that could be interpreted as Marxist or neo-Marxist except for the most unbelievably elastic of the imaginations. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples have immunity incorporated into malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans do not have. By the time they were at the peak of their successes, the Aztec, Maya, and Inca civilizations were as advanced as any in the world-and so rich; sometimes more. American aboriginal populations and Khoi-San * were decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European settlers were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other peoples of sub-Saharan Africa.) So I do not see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can find to complain about is that the show does not tell me anything I did not know when I finished seventh grade. There is really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film. However, it presents some dramatic dramatizations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values ​​are very high; and fills in a few holes that have not been addressed in Mrs. Gruber's Social Studies class at Milan High School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, assuming you have a good job. primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a fun and enjoyable time reviewing what you have already learned (or should have learned) by the time you reached high school.
