Have fun watching this movie .. despite the feeling that I have most of the time, that this movie was almost copying Monsters SA. There are some things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child, other animals trying to break that relationship, etc. It seemed very well to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> One of the redeeming features, though, is Scrat :) Very funny character even though he is no good :)
