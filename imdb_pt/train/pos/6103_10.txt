I saw the movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was a lot of fun and it's something I believe the world, and black America is ready to see. Has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. It's a good movie. The characters were well developed, and the film had a wide variety of prominent actors, including Wood Harris (Remembrance of the Titans, Pay in Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline , Pirates of the Caribbean). The film addresses many relevant topics in today's society in a short period of time, and does so with class and grace. This is not just a story about hospital life, however, it's a story about people and their personal journey to find out who they are, or who they are going to be.
