The Enterprise pilot has something missing since the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic and imperfect personalities. The utopian characters of the next generation became tiresome, so noble that they were unbelievable. I also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter towards the Vulcans. It's funny to see them as pretentious snobs. This makes me anxious to see when humans become the dominant race between the two, though I do not think it would work over the deadline of the show. The only bad points that jumped at me were the "fast cut of the end in 2 hours" from the end, which is common among many of the shows in the series. The second was the shameless search for ratings by some sensually sexy scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction program should be able to stand on its own without trying to fill the preteen adolescent with a little skin. But it's not my job to make the program profitable, so that's fine. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode happens.
