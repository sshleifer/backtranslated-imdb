Whoopi was the only reason I attended the Oscar that year. She's hilarious. Of course there was a big serious side on the show. She was great not only because it's funny but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. Whites need to be reminded that the ceremonies, employment, and portrayal of Hollywood prizes are out of racial balance. There should be no need for "black" premium programs. Those appointed by the white bread and the judges must bring their heads into the sunlight and see that the great stuff is not limited to directors, producers, actors, etc. "white". Allowing Woody Allen in the air was the depth of bad taste. He had no business being there. The fact is that this is the first Oscar presentation I've watched since "The Color Purple" went to the awards. That abortion of vote irritated me when watching the shows until 2002. What is not to denigrate other presenters. Billy Crystal is a riot.
