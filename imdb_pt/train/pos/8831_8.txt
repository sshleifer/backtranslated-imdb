Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> Although the lead actress is beautifully beautiful, the plot is unlikely to be accepted because too many details distract the audience during the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> You can believe that middle school girls in the 1950s easily gave away their virginity without thinking of marrying a 30-year-old they barely know about, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> "EASILY GIVE ABSENT VIRGINITY"? WHAT A SHREWD WATCHES ABOUT THIS MOVIE. REALLY. <br /> <br /> One can believe that high school teens are highly self-confident and self-confident in interacting with older people in complex social situations, but my experience has been mostly adolescents. I feel very clumsy and I am awkward to experiment in the adult world. <br /> <br /> YOU CAN NOT SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENT FROM YOUR OWN EYES? This is sad. <br /> <br /> You may believe that an experienced doctor does not know the stinging oder of Stroptomycin - the stinking by-product of the fermentation of occupied earth microbes - and does not detect that some lifeless powder is false, but I do not think . <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER OPINION OF "EXPERT", DEVELOPED OF EXPERIENCE. DANDY. <br /> <br /> One can believe that troublemakers in their mid-30s can enter and stay inside a public school during a social school and cause problems, but I think that the school's social activities are traditionally an environment protected and parents, staff and school staff would be around to avoid this. <br /> <br /> NOW BE A GOOD SPORT AND TELL US IN WHICH INSTITUTION YOU GROWN. <br /> <br /> A final ending, throughout Hey Babu Riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the quartet. There is probably an explanation why FIVE were FOUR, but as never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> Of course there is an explanation. GOOD JOB FIGURANDO THAT OUT! NOW IT WILL BE GENEROUS AND HELP IT TO YOUR MISERY: IT WAS TRANSLATED AS A GENERAL "FOURSOME", THE "ƒçETVORKA" WORD HAS ANOTHER MEANING: IT IS A SPORTS TIME TO USING A 4M OR 4W CONFIGURATION - A CREW CONSISTING OF 5 PEOPLE: 4 ROWERS AND ONE COXSWAIN. <br /> <br /> This movie does not sound true to me. <br /> <br /> WE SHOULD EVERYONE HEAR YOUR COMPETENT OPINION AND PRAISEWORTHY. FACE.
