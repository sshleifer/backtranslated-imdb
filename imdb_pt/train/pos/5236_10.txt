This stylishly sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story. The protagonist is screenwriter Bart Klever, who struggles persistently with his new text? which is, at the same time, the script of the movie we are watching. In the movie, Bart plays a screenwriter writing the script for the movie? Bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as well as the ambience of the apartment where he works and cares for his little girl. The intimate setting offers ample opportunities for games of illusion involving space, light, colors and some cats. The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker's interventions, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the changing similarity environment. The ever-changing angle of vision complicates the answers to the questions that arise: what is "truth" and "illusion"? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a basic point of orientation in narrative space?
