Let me be honest, I like flesh. However, it's like one of those "easier dives" you see in the Olympics. It has to be marked a bit because it is easier to give a cheap emotion than to drag it into the world of, say, a late medieval painter. <br /> <br /> This is just a ghost ride of two hours and while often (or more precisely, most of the time!) ridiculous and improbable always goes ahead and always amuses. If not always on the right path. Check out the memorable quotes section for a laugh. <br /> <br /> (However, why was it given a "Worst Movie"? Razzie is disconcerting - I bet there were a thousand worst movies made in 2006, but this movie was treated because it was seen as a fashion victim. ) <br /> <br /> The main case and popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her like flies follow a horse during a hot spell. My God, she can not even visit the bathroom without tripping over at least two corpses, and I'm sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse apartment, she would fall in Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, clearly a very dangerous woman to be circling (if you like your wrist to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a killer? Equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual. However, is this just a personality disorder (some form of b / s risk) or more proof of your guilt? For reasons I can not fully understand or explain, Stone is assigned to psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than being taken down from the cells after another "lover found dead in mysterious circumstances ". Fortunately (by Stone) he is much crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled domestic / professional life. In the blink of an eye, the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is difficult to say because everything becomes a rotating blur. <br /> <br /> In this intoxicating mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welshman). Sounding David Thewlis), which tells the doctor in love - in his capacity as a police officer of many years - that the lady in question can be dangerous. I mean, hold the first page. However, Glass is now too glazed to notice or care. As a stunned boxer in front of a Mike Tyson in prime time, he's ready for the big fall, but not before finding out that Washburn could have a secret or two. <br /> <br /> Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) a psychiatrist colleague and a rare example (in this movie) of someone who is not barking mad or a murder suspect. Assuming she has actually watched the final film, she must look back with nostalgia when her panties come off with Stone's ease - fortunately (at least for us) those days are gone. Strangely, she does not think Stone is as dangerous as anyone else-or she does not think the script is good enough or that her test is big enough to make a good performance. <br /> <br /> After several laps of the band more or less described above reaches a climax that mixes a provincial representative with a rustle / twist that, though as farsque as the rest of the film, gives us enough space to Wild Instinct 3 - highly unlikely this may be at this point in time.
