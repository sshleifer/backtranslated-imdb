This image was banned from American theaters in 1930 because of the nudity of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), who caused all sorts of problems among women in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who marries an older man and is transported to the bridal night threshold and the husband never marries and cares for all sorts of very mean things like shoes and insects killers. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day, Eva strolls on her horse and decides to swim naked on a lake in the woods. Her horse runs away and she runs after him and is watched by a young man who finds his clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very familiar and there is a romance that begins to flourish. There are many other interesting issues that come up when you see this movie at the end. Enjoy a great classic movie that was a Shocker Film in 1933. Have fun.
