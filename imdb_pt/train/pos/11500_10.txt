If Mulder was looking for his real father here, he is Darren McGavin, the first X Files, sorry it was only one season. The producers of this show did not know they had the ingredients of a classic in their hands and in 1993 Chris Carter came up with what I call Night Stalker's accompaniment, The X Files. Both will fall as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes once in a while and that should appear in the X Files years later Darren McGavin as Agent Arthur Dales helping our two favorite heroes, resolving cases. Paying homage to the man I think so, well done Chris Carter bringing back a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if it was not for watching the X files and that particular show I would have never known about the Night Tracker.
