I saw it last night on TV, and I was very happy. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of movie that makes you feel good and warm around the heart, and believes there's still some goodness in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what grace was doing to help and protect her - the old cop is my favorite), although you know that this story is not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved acting (they all looked like ordinary people, living in picturesque little English seaside town) but the biggest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has! Just remember the scene in the store with two old ladies after they had their "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending was a bit confusing, but that did not stop me from really, really enjoying the whole story!
