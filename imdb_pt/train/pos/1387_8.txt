A bit slow (somehow, like a film by Sofia Coppola), but still a very catchy movie about the discovery of sexuality by three teenagers. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories of how old they were. Confusion and insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way, but so true to life. The music is perfect and the acting is incredible. The camera works beautifully too. I strongly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look at this specific period of life when we discover our sexual urges and our desires. I would also say that it is a great movie for young people going through this period. So many movies were made about adolescence, but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its intricacies.
