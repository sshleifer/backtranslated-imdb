I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of all the other bad reviews. I thought: Even if I do not read the books, it does not look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard. But I was wrong. Of course, it was not a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie of something, you have to modify it to become a big-screen entertainment. The plot was enjoyable and exciting with many real scares and I thought Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments and unlike many statements, at no point in this movie Nancy comes out as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing that this movie also did well was balancing the whole thing with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie What a movie, what a movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some scary moments because I was, like, going crazy! Go see him or be a bum and let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made. I love this, I want to own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. I love it, I love it.
