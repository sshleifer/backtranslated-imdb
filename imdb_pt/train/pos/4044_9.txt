I found this movie very well rhythmic. The premise is quite imaginative, and as a spectator I was pulled along with the development of the characters. Rhythm is done very well for those who like to think - enough is kept hidden from the viewer at first, and questions keep coming up, which are answered later, producing a well thought out and very satisfying movie, both brainy and action . <br /> <br /> It seems like some people were looking for a roller coaster with no stops with this movie - one of those coming out of the gate. That would be more analogous to one of those roller coasters that first takes you to the top of the hill - creating a wonderful sense of anticipation - and ultimately is, in my opinion, more gratifying to the foundation initially established. <br /> /> Excellent movie.
