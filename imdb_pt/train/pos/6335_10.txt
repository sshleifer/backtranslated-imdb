Well, I come from Bulgaria, where it is almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be "very, very scared" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a great job with this movie! I do not know exactly how old he was, but he did not act like a child (well done)! Now, about the tornado - it was not very realistic, but it scares you! If you want to have fun in front of the television - this is the movie!
