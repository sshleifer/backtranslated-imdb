This whole movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - it's the best end of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this film delightful, even with the French thing about getting too serious. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians got mixed up - and, by the way, the music during the final credits is great. I want the CD!
