Filming is enjoyable and the environment is intensely realistic. I liked to boldly correct conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morals of mainland China's interior of the 1930s, as well as more basic human issues - I felt I could have a real sense of the times, recreated even in splendid photos of traditional Chinese . theater and purist representations of street life. It seemed to be worth a try. The intertwined paper that Buddhism plays is probably the most faithful to form - both in its mental and philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective I have ever seen in Chinese cinema. Casting is great. Images are memorable. Acting is solid enough. Childish, but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of his expression.
