For a long time, I liked this movie better than the original Aussie Bear movie. Well last summer, I watched them together and decided I was wrong. The first one is a best film of Affectionate Bears (as you might have guessed if you read my review). This is not a bad movie, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, as some people have mentioned, it completely denies any knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the genres of some characters and how they all met). When I was little and watched it, I was a bit confused and upset. I felt the same way seeing this as an adult! <br /> <br /> About the reasons why the movie is actually very good (IF you disassociate it from the first movie). I can not think of another movie for young children with a demon as it is villan! Now I'm not even for a minute suggesting that the evil demons who want to steal the souls of the Campers and Affectionate Bears are good, I just think it's cool that there's a SUPREMELY EVIL EVIL in a movie for little kids! It's like that bizzare movie "Santa Clause vs. Satan" from Mexico that you hear sometimes. <br /> <br /> Either way, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this girl to help him get the Loving Bears in exchange for him giving him special powers. Too dark for a kid movie eh? And I mentioned that Darkheart appears to the girl more often as a WHINEY VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY ?? Weird! Meanwhile, some other kids are in Care-a-Lot caring for BABY CARE! Oh man! Demons and Baby Care Bears IN THE SAME MOVIE !!!!! Needless to say, everything gets enlightened at the end (but not before seeing Darkheart trapping the souls of Affectionate Bears in this scary chandelere thing in a [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene). But I wondered if this movie met the cult audience it so richly deserves. I could just watch it myself.
