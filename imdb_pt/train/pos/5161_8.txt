Kirk and the crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants, but find the place deserted except for a Mr. Atoz operating some kind of high-tech library. Despite trying to get a direct response from him about everyone's whereabouts, Atoz is indifferent to his questions and insists that they should quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'. They have no idea what they are talking about, but wander around looking at hand-held discs over the viewers and seeing images of the planet's past. So while a disk is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the door and is magically transported back in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. Too late, they realize that the library is a time travel machine and a repository. <br /> <br /> Although Kirk's visit is short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more agitated as Spock falls in love. to Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this horrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the usually logical subject. <br /> <br /> Spock's departure from the norm, wildly inventive script and very diverse sites make this an exceptional episode - worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the excellent actor, played Mr. Atoz. I'm a big fan of old movies and I saw him as a supporting actor in countless films in the 1930s and '40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this 1969 episode. Curiously, though it looked old, it lived another 23 years - dying with more than 95 years !!
