I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a private program. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I was curious about the commercial program that aired, which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about this in the beginning, especially after the end of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow!! First of all, I thought he took the subject of death and presented it in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of his death. <br /> <br /> Most characters have a craving for things they can not have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian yearn for their niece Chuck and Emerson are always yearning for the monetary rewards of the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and believable. I like how Emerson, who is black, plays with the rest of the characters since he was African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough for the mysterious fans . I just wanted the writers to get back to work, so the show could continue to evolve.
