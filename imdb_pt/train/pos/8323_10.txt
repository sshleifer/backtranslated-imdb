"A little absurd from time to time, is valued by the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you're too smart to watch this movie then you're too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece made with sharp eye for detail. Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - and others - just wonderful! <br /> <br /> Rent, sit, relax, smile a little. Have a good time. <br /> <br /> So thank you.
