Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in some Entomology children's classes and I still remember the children's emotions; they were delighted! It is not just the termites that have built and live in the "Castles of Clay", but also the other animals that use the mountains. There is a fantastic scene in which a snake fights a lizard while a colony of mongooses watches. It is not only good for entomology classes but also for teaching about ecology as there is a lot about the interactions between termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all organisms living in and around the mountains. <br /> <br /> I wish it were available on DVD, so I could watch it again and show it to others.
