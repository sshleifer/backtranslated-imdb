This movie has a very simple but clever premise - an unemployed trying to rob a convenience store, and the store clerk gets you in the act ... the thief runs off with the store clerk right behind him. All the while, the store clerk is in trouble with a low Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Throughout the pursuit of the thief, they catch the attention of the Yakuza, who was looking for the convenience store clerk. The story then moves at high speed in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but is added with the dog running after the cat. All 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (it can be translated to English like "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about the persecution, and the persecution continues and continues until the end of the second act, the vagabond forgets why he is fleeing, and to Yakuza don does not remember which of the two guys he's chasing, nor does he remember why they're running away from him. <br /> <br /> Similar to SABU's later film, POSTMAN BLUES, most of the film is simply the whole chase. and action, with lots of physical comedy and black humor injected to keep the audience involved. What lies behind is the finale, for which the chase for when the three men run out of energy, and into one of the most chaotic Mexican riots you'll see in the movie it seems almost as if Sabu were paying tribute to Tony Scott. TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
