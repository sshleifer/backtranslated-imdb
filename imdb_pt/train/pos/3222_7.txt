The first two sequences of this film establish the two conflicts: the thematic conflict between the soldier Todd and his repressed humanity, and the physical conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered substitute. Both sequences are quite interesting in different ways. <br /> <br /> Peoples' script hesitates a bit when it comes to solving the first of these arcs in the middle of the movie, which means the second time is little more than a simple action action. <br /> <br /> However, compliments to the makers to create a piece of genre action with heart and even a little soul and especially to Kurt Russell, who broadcasts a lot with very little. <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's worth seeing.
