CREEP is a serious and serious horror movie that wants nothing more than to show that people are attacked on an empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. And that does exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith traces the drama in the most plausible way possible by introducing a series of characters who really would have a reason to be on the subway after he was blocked. It also leaves the origins of the Creep title deliberately vague (illegal experiences going on in the 1960s are hinted at) and that a bit of mystery works most of the time. Unfortunately, it weakens to the end, in fact, holding back from a turnaround that ends where more genetic malformations would appear (they are also hinted at). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a clich√© ending! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Powerful is good as the female leader terrified and the rest of the cast is fine.
