As romantic comedies go, this was a beautiful and winner. I thought the writing might have been stronger to build the final connection a little better, but that's not a big stumbling block. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf perform well and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was happy to see them as romantic links. I hope to see them launched on more projects soon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and victorious. Not a bad thing to be at all.
