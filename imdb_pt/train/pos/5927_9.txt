Stephen King movies are a funny thing to me. I really love them or I hate them. Some of the more fanciful productions (like Desperation and Storm of the Century) I did not like. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved it. Sleepwalkers is one that I really enjoy and watch regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, shape-shifting creatures that, though human as they look, switch to a feline-like creature. They are immune to the scratching of cats, and whenever they move to a new town, they set traps to capture and kill the animals. When they move to their newest town, they need to look for a virgin and when Charles finds one, he really falls in love with her, but his mother needs to feed on her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save her mother? <br /> <br /> Although this story has incest incognitos that some may find unpleasant, it actually plays a part in the story and therefore is not just put into the film. because of the scandal. Like most Stephen King stories, it is based on a small town with many interesting characters. The acting is not the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is a very nice and pleasant adaptation. <br /> <br /> For UK Readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels.
