This movie makes a strong comment about the Italian people of the time. The use of the mirrors to highlight the revelations of the characters is beautiful and I can not fail to mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love both. Your way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you can question whether the camera is actually there. The husband, in his brief role, is also excellently portrayed as the fascist Italian who commands his wife and children, but in his own way, a loving father. The opening scenes with Hitler on Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and really put the film historically. I loved the movie and I also agree that it's funny not to be better known.
