Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, a former coup assigned to an office job where he meets Carla, a secretary who is rather deaf, when she has her hearing instruments very deaf ?? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together, they help each other develop as people. <br /> <br /> What was particularly interesting about this movie was the complexity of the characters? not fitting into obvious stereotypes. Paul seems uncomfortable in the office environment, is he just not ready for work? This belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain amorality that I find refreshing and showed how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie full of great moments, both moving and comic. One is when Carla is a nanny and is trying to comfort a crying baby. Does she still hold him? but it takes your hearing aids to your own comfort.
