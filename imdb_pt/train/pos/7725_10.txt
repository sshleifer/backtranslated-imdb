I saw this movie for the first time when it came out originally. I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie very entertaining and very scary and unlike any other movie I had seen up to that point. BASIC PLAN: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a star in the constellation of Aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers who landed twenty years earlier and who did not had been heard ever since. <br /> <br /> THEME: An inferior civilization (like ours) comes into contact with the remains of a very advanced alien civilization, the Krell-200,000 years removed. The "seed" of the destruction of one civilization is being passed on to another, without knowing at first. The theme of this film is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time with my brother when he left originally. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really frightened me, as did the battle scenes with the invisible force of the Creature. I was also struck by how real things looked in the movie. <br /> <br /> What really catches my eye as an adult is the truth of the movie "forbidden knowledge," and how relevant that will be when we do it. (if ever) to get in touch with an advanced civilization (alien) much more developed than ourselves today. Advanced technology and accountability seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work by ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power" is, at best, in fact, it is not correct! Knowledge is "potential" power depending on how it is applied (... if it applies to everyone.) [It's not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> The impact of this film can be perceived at some point in the future of humanity itself. This is knowledge itself and by itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to actually control our own destiny OR we will end up like the Krell in the film - just winked out. <br /> Many thanks to all those who replied to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all much appreciated !! I hope you are as entertained by this story as I have been for the past 40 years. <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
