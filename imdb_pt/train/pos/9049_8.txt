There's an old saying about Joe Johnston's new movie, which goes something like this: "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can not, both are right." This is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self-motivation and belief in an individual, which in this film remains true even after street blocks and family problems get in the way. "October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself called Homer Hickam, growing up in a traditional and strict family in the 1950s. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where almost every man grows to be a miner. All your friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell think their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer is not exiled about this future. <br /> <br /> One night as everyone looks up at the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik goes overboard. This is something new to Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, your look at life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the field of rocket scientist for an occupation. Amazed at what he says, his family passes this idea over their heads and continues with life as always. His friends, however, think this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very intelligent individual when it comes to this sort of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start testing model rockets and blow up a white fence on a pedestal, then what looks like a forest fire is frightened by them, they are forced to stop their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are absolutely fascinating from start to finish. All the actors make performances like that's the real baba here. Standing out in all glory: Laura Dern as Miss. Riley. This may well be Academy Award material if judges can remember the beginning of the year when this movie is released. <br /> <br /> The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only does filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how successful they are in their rocket study. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially the father, who is engaged in the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum in the middle of the road because of a fool. , a recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother robbed him of it. That sort of thing is becoming so common in high school movies, not that this movie is meant for high school students. The actors look at each other without thinking, as if in a trance. I tolerated it without complaining in 1997, "Inventing the Abbots," but I've had enough of that. <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor complaint. With an authentic period of time, cinematography worthy of an Oscar and real life clips, Homer and friends in the end, all hit by dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999. <br /> <br /> <
