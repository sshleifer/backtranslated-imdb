Four stories written by Robert Bloch about several people living in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he is writing about coming to life. Some scary moments and the turnaround in the end were good. The second has Peter Cushing getting obsessed with a wax figure reminiscent of his dead wife. The third is Christopher Lee, who has a son (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. It all leads to a scary ending (although the end of the story has been MUCH worse). The last one is a comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing the scene) and a cover that turns people into vampires! There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good horror anthology - nothing terrifying, but the first and the end of the third gave me some nice shivers. Also the bedroom is really very funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks beautiful ... and very creepy. It is well run with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie score as well. All in all a little good horror anthology was worth looking for. Try to see it on DVD - the Lions Gate looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
