I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie - I probably know the entire dialogue back and forth - but I'm attracted to it over and over again. Defined in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible bachelor "Kralik", who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara." Kralik secretly becomes the friend of Klara and, in the joint work, Klara trusts in Kralik the contents of its letters (of Kralik). Of course Kralik is obsessed with Klara - but he can not express his feelings while competing with the "pen-friend". Confused? Well, you will not be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it's the end we all want. Other characters worthy of mention are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the owner of the Hugo Matuschek store, Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik's confidant. Joseph Schildkraut as the arrogant womanizer "Vadas" - so well played that you can not help but hate him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to approach us all with his arrogant confidence of a junior shop "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently re-made as "You've Got Mail" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect the younger crowd would disagree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is in your area over Christmas, I suggest you a good glass of wine, put a firewood in the fire and have a box of tissues handy.
