I really can not remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. Certainly it's weird - like a rubber exam in a road accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said the truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really can not understand how a fictional account of this documentary will be released this year. How can you improve this? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin moves away from the New York Society and they hide in Hampton's. In the process, they become prisoners and what is best described as "cat crazy women." They would have been hiding if the town had not moved the damnation of the estate by the filth and subsequent ransom for Jackie. This movie was made after this rescue. All the time, you could not help thinking, "What the hell was that before?" It's a look at the high society on the darker side and it's absolutely fascinating.
