It did for the crime that "Not Another Teen Movie" did for the school. I laughed all the time as two inept gangs fought each other and each other. A subtle comedy of jokes and jokes that kept me going all the way. I suppose the biggest joke in the whole movie was that time never seemed to go ahead leaving the characters stuck in the 30's.
