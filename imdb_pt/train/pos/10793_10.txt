There are some spoilers in this review !! <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others, I really enjoyed the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series. I'm a fan of Judson Mills but also a big fan of Chuck Norris and while admitting that some of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little, the plot fits well with other weekly series that The Fifteen Minute Opening with Deke rushing from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action-packed. I do not see how many "pros" failed to reach a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, being the hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> As for commenting on the need to "get the movie in the can to fill the time frame after the playoffs." This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for a screening in January and filming was completed in May 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the US. If the commentator had paid attention to the film, instead of trying to avoid it, they might have realized the plot of the story: Rashid, a character from bin Laden, planned to launch a nuclear device in the United States. The President of Man was called to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should really watch the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
