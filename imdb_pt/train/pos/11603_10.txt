The first time I saw I got half, but I watched and later learned that it was about a trial of salem witches. They focused on Sara Good's family. SHE is famous for cursing a priest who came true. In the film she portrays her daughter Dorcas and her husband the spirit of Ann Putnam. Sara's husband comes to the future to hunt this girl to redeem her soul. which happens at the end of the movie. Dorcas is portrayed as a 5 year old witch who is burned at the stake. What never happens Ann Putnam saves her from the flames. the girl is safe, she goes to Ann Putnam's grave to see that she is not empty, but it is at first because she accuses her of witchcraft and lets her burn to the death. Now that ann putnam saves her, her spirit is redeemed, and she is not a pariah to society for the salem witch trials.
