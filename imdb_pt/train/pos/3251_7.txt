Still another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", remake of Sergio Leone of "Yojimbo" of Kurosawa (suggested by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This is strictly a B-Movie; taken so, is quite nice. the direction is clear, the full performance of the verve, the limitations of your 'direct to the video' photo treated well. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film lies in the disastrous decision to marry the 'handful'. '/' yojimbo 'plot for a sub-plot of' Once Upon a Time in the West 'by Leone. Although Leone directed both "Fistful" and "West," his motivations behind the two films could not be more different. The "nameless man" (Eastwood) is a borderline social path with a crush on broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with her own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have much to do with each other. In order to join them, 'Gun Crazy' has to twist the plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we are really following. <br /> <br /> But this is a B movie after all, and full of action and foolishness; It's fun on this level, just do not expect anything else.
