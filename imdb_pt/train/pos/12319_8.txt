First things first, female lead is too beautiful to be missed. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old and well aged. It is always good to review these glorious moments when you see old Hong Kong productions like this. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles made in the 80's. Decorating the art scene and other aesthetic facets are fascinating. More fantastically, the film had a totally black tone of humor. It looks like a horror movie, but in the end it's not scary, but just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story," and I thought the script was a decent script. . However, when I saw the film, I was disappointed to see the film different from the script, as on a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. However, it turned out to be better run in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the Lord of the Rings, you will notice the similarities of this movie with LOTR. The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto struggling with the Witch of the Ring. It's definitely a laugh. Angry!
