Daniell Steel's father, what a refreshing story. This film glorified the importance of family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is this? In these times of "Heather has two moms" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it's easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. With Dad's roles being prominent, I expected it to be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing to finish. Each character was important and did a fabulous job taking his role. I would love to see every character develop over the years. I loved this movie, it's one that I'll watch defiantly every time it's turned on. Good story, good acting, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but without indiscreet sex or bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Attention, get the Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely represented today in our entertainment, be it television or TV. Movies. Daniell if your listening, You Go Girl, give us more.
