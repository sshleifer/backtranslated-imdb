This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the outset I was completely hooked on the (true) story when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cries while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays so well and with so much sympathy that the viewer almost starts to feel sorry for him until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow, was absolutely believable in every detail, and the argument he makes when he talks about paranoia in the Soviet Union is made clear by the behavior of local communist commissar Bondarchuk. Joss Ackland. For me, however, the excellent performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what an excellent actor he really is. I was almost crying when he told Burakov how the FBI had followed closely and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs in shadow, from the atmospheric Soviet and somber landscape, to the superlative performances of all involved. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
