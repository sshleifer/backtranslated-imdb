What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat monotonous affair is at the end quite hilarious and fun. "Right to Die" is not too full of suspense, but it's more than made up for by some weird pieces and over the top. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> Main Credits also go to Martin Donovan's performance as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. Playing with the character in an "indifferent" way, you almost feel bad for the guy at the end, when your grand plan fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews the landscape by playing a not-so-good guy who gets his fair deserts. <br /> <br /> End of the Spoiler. As a revenge of the dead film, "Right to Die" benefits the artists a lot and is more than a sure way to spend less than an hour.
