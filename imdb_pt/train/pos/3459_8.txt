Along with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic villain of Columbus. The first "proper" episode of Columbus, after two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from the classic status. <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of a murder mystery writing partnership. His partner, Jim, is the talented, while Ken has no talent other than the gift of the word and an ability to promote books. Once Jim decides he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken creates a plan to kill Jim. Except that it is not a new plot, it is actually the implementation in real life of a murder plot originally intended for one of his books. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Columbo to discover that Ken is the killer, although unfortunately another murder has to happen (Ken forgives and then kills an important witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction. <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong with "Murder By The Book", but it's not very high level. I would just give Publish Or Perish the advantage over it: both episodes feature Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish Or Perish" is a more tense and unpredictable fraction. But this is still a great episode.
