This is a gem of a movie not only for people who enjoy fun and quirky installations but who love the history and traditions of science fiction films and Hollywood classics. Each alien of the Martian crew is the embodiment of a classic science fiction character or member of Hollywood royalty and it is pure pleasure to see them swing between themselves and the residents of Big Bean.
