Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought that this movie would live up to my expectations. It is true that this film began slowly, but, as the film progressed, it was more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and it's about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in legendary Atlantis. Along with his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an incredible adventure of his own. Along the way, he must love friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. The voice cast is great. They certainly know how to load movies just with their vocal talent. The music is nothing special, but nice anyway. The animation is not the best, but it's still good enough. Overall this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
