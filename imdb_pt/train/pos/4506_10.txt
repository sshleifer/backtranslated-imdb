I want to add to the praise for the production of this film, especially the luminous cinematography. The firelight shining on soft, muscled skin creates incredibly beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar - the first one given for editing. Mala's performance is temperamental, penetrating and powerful.
