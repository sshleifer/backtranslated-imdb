This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, an impressive main character, very good deed and killer action. This occurs mainly in the year 2036, but shows scenes that happen in recent years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well made and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all other soldiers have never had a normal life. Eventually, the army introduces younger, younger, faster, and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee being one of them. As a result, they do not need old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by getting them to fight some of the old soldiers in the battle in which Russell is injured and supposedly dead. The military leaves their body and fewer others, assuming they are all dead, but what they do not realize is that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a field full of civilizations on this planet that the military dumped him. For a while he lives there but can not adjust to normal life. He rarely says a word and is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. When they feel that it is a danger to them, they send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> As soon as Russell is leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily outruns them. The military begins to realize this, and Todd kills all but one of his men. That's Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell obviously is at the top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I have seen and seen so much. This has everything you could ask for in a movie, including some great lines. The writer also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, as he calls even the ladies of "sir." There are no holes in this movie, every minute has a purpose and it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> An incredible army action movie for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all fans of Kurt Russell and fans of action / science fiction.
