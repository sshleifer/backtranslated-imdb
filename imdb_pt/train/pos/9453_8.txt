Deliverance is the fascinating, haunted and sometimes even upsetting tale of James Dickey, turned into a brilliant John Boorman movie. It's about four businessmen, driven by masculinity and macho behavior, who are spending a weekend of canoeing high in the mountains. Up there, they come across all the darkest sides of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, cheating and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey soon turns into an odyssey through a violent and lurid mountain land, completely alienated from all forms of civilization. All these elements really make Deliverance one of the meanest movies I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is a very important film too. The best of John Boorman (followed closely by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and contains several memorable scenes that have already appeared in numerous other films. Just think of the fantastic soundtrack of "Duels of Banjos" and, of course, the unforgettable scene of homosexual rape "scream like a pig". All actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. Especially Jon Voight. A must see movie !!
