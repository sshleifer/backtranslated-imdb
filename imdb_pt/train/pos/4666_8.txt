It is very crafty for all 60's to look at the film. The humor is very kind, but it has grown much more than I expected. The cast is top notch and they seem to be having a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders through the film muttering some funny things in a low voice, and everything is very inconsequential; I will buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The plot is that Ustinov as a embezzlement released from prison impersonating a computer genius and defrauding money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith has been her secretary for a while, and seeing her being fired from many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual self, and Karl Malden has fun as the dense, sloppy executive who runs the London office. The ending is funny and well cynical.
