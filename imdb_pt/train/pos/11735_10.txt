This movie is pure Elvira and shows it to the chest ... I mean better! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by the intelligence and charm of Elvira. The viewer has the opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she fights against the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Mass. (Where she traveled from Los Angeles to watch her aunt Morganna's will read). The same time tries to help the suffering teenagers who were deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity Pariah and the rest of the city council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the local movie owner, and another woman (Patty) who has her eye on Bob as well, but is not as deserving of her love as Elvira. And later in the film, she also faces the complications of being a descendant of "a great metaphysical celebrity" and the accusations of witchcraft brought against her, which means she will be burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, disobedient and naive in this movie, while making risky jokes and transmits off-beat lines with double meanings. <br /> <br /> This film is inspiring because it gives the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie countless times and I never get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the film. A review will not do justice to the movie itself, so I can only tell you to watch it because it's one of the best movies ever made! Meanwhile, I wish you "unpleasant dreams!"
