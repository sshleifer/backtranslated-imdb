Surprisingly good initial effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original scripts written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows a remarkable story structure. It starts with an exciting boxing match in which the champion of the carnival "One Round" Jack loses to a challenger of the public who happens to be a boxing pro. The film then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup for the rematch between the two men, this time for the heavy crown. Even in this initial film, Hitchcock shows his talent for a significant cinematography and proposition placement. An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of her infidelity. The only great detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927. The final match as a result turns out to be somewhat anticlimactic. The story, however, is what carries this film.
