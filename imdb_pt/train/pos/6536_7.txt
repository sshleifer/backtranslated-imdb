Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been a great literature. It's in the same category as the nanny club, the magic treehouse, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original stories of the formula. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "cool", she has no internal conflict! and never changes. Ned is pretty much the same. The film was true to this style and I must say I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it had the same nostalgic flavor that the books held. I had the right amount of suspense for my kids (8 and 10). There was almost no offensive language. I liked the push for a more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit annoying. He was a little out of place on the school campus. I never understood why he was there in the first place.
