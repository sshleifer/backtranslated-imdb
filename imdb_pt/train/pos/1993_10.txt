This is a musical adaptation of "Oliver Twist" by Dicken. For the most part, the original story was retained, although for the film flow certain subplots (such as the summer that it has been recovering and the half brother) are omitted. The biggest difference in the film and the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin is hanged - a very different ending to this musical movie. <br /> <br /> This is a type of musical-- one whose style and scope have not really been matched before or after. Not only are the songs often quite singelable and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. While in most musicals a few people or maybe even a small group are choreographed dancing, here the numbers usually reach hundreds or maybe more. It's really a sight to see and I was lucky to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and it's one of my earliest childhood memories. Having just seen this again a few moments ago, I would have to say that the movie only got better with time. Great sets, wonderful acting and singing - this is a special treat that is hard not to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was amazed at how loud and feminine Mark Lester's singing went to the movie. Well, according to IMDb, her singing was voiced by a girl and that would definitely explain her voice.
