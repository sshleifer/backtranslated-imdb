King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain), who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to go back to England and be the father of his son. He discovers that his wife's parents took custody of their son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. There comes Alison Deedy (who plays Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe to rescue the map that Elizabeth's father had sent him. Elizabeth seeks Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some (Russian) enemies who want the map too. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention to the end. Patrick, once again, plays an honorable and handsome man who comes to the aid of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the sturdy and silent man, anger and strength; In King Solomon's Minds, your character actually smiles a few times. I'd really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed love story live again, one in which he does not have to squeeze his jaws and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and it's worth watching.
