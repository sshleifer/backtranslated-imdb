I got this movie on my local movie channel and I really enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the elements of a good teen movie, and more - this film, in addition to dealing with relationships between boys and girls and sex and the like, also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people. <br /> <br /> The movie has that real feel - no loud music, no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which for this movie was right. This sensation facilitates the relationship with the characters in the film - some of whom we probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, fun to watch. 8/10
