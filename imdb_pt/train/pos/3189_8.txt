This is one of the best comedy / musical "B" movies I've ever seen (and since I'm in the 40's now and only seeing this now, I'm no expert, but I've seen all the well-known movies out there). When there are a ton of actors gaining the lead for minutes on end, comedy generally interferes with musical stretches, and often the musical pieces interrupt the comic flow. Call me crazy, but when I saw this at TCM Europe, I was laughing loudly with pleasure! So who laughed at me? No doubt Mischa Auer gave me some incredible laughs, he even stole the end, it was great! Speaking of which, I think this movie works because, although L & H is a selling point (and why I got addicted to watching that one (they and Hal Roach), I love them in their previous Hal Roach material), this keeps them to a minimum and stays directly in the ADULT rate (by the 1930s standards, and not so far from current standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit that I only know him from W OZ and I loved him there, and I also laugh out loud here on his waiter's bit on show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the 1930s movies that really excites me (something tells me she was a real life fighter); and the musical numbers have a real professional production quality (Busby Berkley'ish), which has pushed me away from what I am accustomed to in this genre. I could go on and on, but make sure I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I saw at TCM Europe and will record to watch again with my wife at TCM USA. Good thing!
