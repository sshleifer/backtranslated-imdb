Some compared this movie to Deliverance. I believe Mice and Men is more appropriate. Our protagonist, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It is irrelevant and irrelevant if this is a sexual love. That's the reason Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as family, as your only connection with humanity. The setting, the setting, the minimal cast, make for a great movie. Frankly, I do not care what happened to the characters. But I cared what the filmmaker did to them. He did well with them. I spent some time wondering how the end would look like Mice and Men. The soundtrack and the cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
