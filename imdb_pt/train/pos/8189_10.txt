This was an excellent 2 part episode, although I have never seen the older ones, I never thought the doctor would go against anything that was paranormal, extra-terrestrial, of course, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> Episode brings the things we most fear and how we humans, in a futuristic moment, would fight and defeat the real evil when most odds say that would be impossible. Being a family movie, I am amazed that they have brought some things like fear and faith, especially if it is also meant to entertain the American public. But who cares what the Yanks say, we rock! Doctor Who has shown potential since the first episode of the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from seriously fun, from light to dark. I hope that many old fans will soon say "The old doctor who returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
