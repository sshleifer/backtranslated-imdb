Everyone knows about this "Zero Day" event. What I think this movie did that Elephant did not do is that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the movie, we like them, laughing with them, even though we know fully what they are going to do. And that gives me shivers. Because I felt guilty for being praised for his comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet face. Even knowing what will happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just decide if they did it at the 3 or 4 count I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads ripped off. Of course I was. I have to like them. They were bad, maybe, but I felt they were really normal, that they really did not realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> That is, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone, may be planning something crazy, and that we will not even notice. This movie, however good it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not sleep now. There is still this little sensation in my stomach. Butterflies
