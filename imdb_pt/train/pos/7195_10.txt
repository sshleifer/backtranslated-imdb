I loved this Republican series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even difficult, the picture quality was not the best, but okay. The fencing in this series is also a bit bad but not terrible. They should only have practiced a little more. Like I said the story is great! You're sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is great! It's the same guy who used the song for the Fox version of Walt Disney, which created the music for Fightin Legion. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is very cool and the legionnaires too! I highly recommend this serial. Buy! <br /> <br /> I love that Reed Hadley plays Fox! He's funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6
