A boy and a girl are chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by chance) the warrior father (or whoever it was). And they travel through nature in the most rudimentary areas of Africa. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is not so good (except for that elephant boy). But it is a very good adventure and is not much censored, there is a bit of blood, flesh and nudity (which light up the film a bit). <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 because of the movie photo. African nature is action.
