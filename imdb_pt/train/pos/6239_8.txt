A film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are not doing. The pace is very calm ...... then you have to relax ....... breathe ... breathe out before you see ...... <br /> <br /> First you think .. but nothing is happening and you get a little annoyed with it ... and that's the problem, because it's the climate of the movie and the realistic social images that are cool in this movie ...... ..... a lot people will say it is disgusting ...... but it is not that bad ... I think it is more used for marketing .... and has some really funny moments ... an old 60 peeling .... I guarantee it is the most unsexy striptease in the history of cinema ...... its movie that is real .. I think it is the word ...... even in its face ... .... and this makes it a bit scary.on the computer manipulation here ..... its real life ... and as we all know movies can conquer reality when it comes to doing sick things ...... .... so it's a lot worse in the real world ....... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie you can start look at their neighbors and think ... maybe they are like the people in t he movie ... I bet there are many of them out there ...... sick ... crazy living with a beautiful facade .. after seeing the movie I feel it is more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ But maybe you should not see this movie on your first date ...... ...
