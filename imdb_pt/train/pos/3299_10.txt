A great movie that requires an acquired taste. If you're into action, wham bam movies and hate love stories then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good clever movie, from time to time I recommend this very well. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian movie that I would give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even so, comes second to this masterpiece.
