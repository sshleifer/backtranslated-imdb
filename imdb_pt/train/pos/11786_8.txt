This is almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this movie a little uncommon for Lynch is the fact that he looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I believe Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, many of Lynch's typical motifs are present such as: camera-floating works; musical haunting; long (excruciating) pauses; curtains hanging; obfuscated lights becoming darker at a slow pace (almost indiscernible); extreme close ups; issues of women in difficulties; over-bearing, incompassionate, all knowing characters facing characters who are distracted, temporarily unconscious, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances are great and the short ones are thought-provoking. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything for interpretation. Many questions go unanswered and this kindles the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort by Lynch. I just hope he does a few more shorts over the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials. They were inspired.
