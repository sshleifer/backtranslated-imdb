Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I was waiting to see it, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Of course, it's weird, but that just gives it a more exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They did not make many, maybe 3 or 4 moles each. So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best either. I believe they play some weird situations there but I see that to find the best points of this movie, the displayed emotions and other embellishments. So I gave, and will always, give this movie 10 out of 10.
