With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, how can you go wrong? Scenics very unusual, especially the modern ones. The realization of modern machinery is very effective. Here you have bursts of lightning weapons from construction vehicles that help to clear the area so that new structures can be made. Although she is much younger in this film, it's not too difficult to figure out who will be the upcoming Mrs. Pumphrey from the BBC series, All Creatures Great and Small! Really effective "reappearance" of Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The musical score is by renowned Swiss composer Artur Honegger and is also unusual. At the time (1936), it seems that they used really large sets or the effects make it look like this. Finally, it's a great story.
