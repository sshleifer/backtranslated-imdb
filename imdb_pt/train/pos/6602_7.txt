Just as Frank Miller and his Sin City comic used black and white to express themselves (and their movie noir influences), Christian Volckman also with the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It's the year 2054, in Paris. . In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a shimmering gem. This is a jewel in a scenario of misery, inequality and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark belly underneath. One of these "brilliant" people at the top, a research scientist at a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well-known and efficient, Captain Karas (voiced by the new James Bond himself - Daniel Craig) is assigned the task of finding it. <br /> <br /> The plot and layout is not overly original. He is heavily influenced by film noir, Gibson's Neuromancer and other detective stories, along with films like Blade Runner, Sin City, Metropolis by Fritz Lang and Minority Report. There is the main plot surrounded by other possible subplots that connect at the end. It's not hard to figure it all out. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film lies in its intense visual presentation. Paris is an intricate set of levels and sub levels. At its base is the most primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city rises, architectural complexity and luminescence also increase. However, in this structure, the top does not equate to the elevation of human ideals and behaviors. Paris has been intrinsically lively and presented in brilliant black and white. The film is more intimate in spirit with Sin City (the comics) then Sin City, the movie was with its source material. This is made even easier, because it still remains relatively in the same medium; animation. Much as a Darkly Scanner pushed the visual aspects of the narrative, so too. Light and darkness, black and white create an atmosphere of contrasts as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all sense while being right in front of us. The film proves how black and white can be ambiguous and obvious at the same time. <br /> <br /> According to the spirit of the film, I can be a critic and a fan. I can love and be reluctant in the same light. It is definitely an experience I recommend for lovers of visual arts. Then, pour another black and brown, enter the emptiness and enjoy the ride.
