One stretch that is often overlooked about this family movie is one of the deals. <br /> <br /> Back in 1994, this movie held the highest film premiere in film history (and can continue to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - undoubtedly named after the original film "Angels," which "haunted" the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake they "haunt" the Angels of California. Anyway, the premiere was held at the former Three Rivers Stadium, which was home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers at the time (the Pirates are now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field ). The premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories tall inside the stadium and held (and may even continue to hold) the record for the film's biggest debut in the history, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were present for the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
