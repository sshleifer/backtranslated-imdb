I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger, and gradually getting less, until I got tired enough, as I'm sure many other viewers have become, so the flood of bloody movies produced in recent years They entertained, but did not scare me or make me squirm. "The dentist" turned that around. <br /> <br /> The setup seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the inside of the mouths, and maybe bodies as well. One clever touch, however, is that the dentist is the protagonist of the movie, so instead of being a one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable. The viewer feels sympathy for him as well as for his victims, and instead of waiting for justice to come to him, I found myself hoping that he somehow found a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> What really "makes" a horror movie is violence. And "The Dentist" does better than any other movie I can imagine. First of all, the film has tons of tension, something that modern gore films tend not to have. In a scene (), the dentist is emotionally disturbed and has to see a child patient for the first time. When it reaches the child's mouth, you expect the encounter to end for the dentist and for the child's sake without injury. I'm not going to ruin what happens. Secondly, when the blood comes, it hits the worst nerves. Once again, I will not give anything. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a movie you've never heard of, it has flaws. Most importantly, it is exclusively for horror fans. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, occurring in a period of only a few days, we do not get any knowledge about the characters. And the tension drops a little at the end. But in fact, wanting to know the story about the characters is proof of how good it is, and most of the film is solid enough that any small lapse of tension can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> It's strange, after years of getting used to movies, I suddenly want to cover my eyes with the sight of blood. "The dentist" made me terrified and completely uncomfortable, and so deserves my full approval.
