I found the quotes memorable looking for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Elder 2: You remember pterodactyls. Elder 1: And I can remember that you fell on that hook and sink line. <br /> <br /> Elderly Person 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: You did it. You put a big bucket in your head and go out with the army boys to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Elder 2: Are not you dead yet?
