The star of this film is the script. Attention to detail for the dress period, language, social customs (we do not hurt women) and the policies are remarkable. It's a reminder of Kosovo today. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive onlooker and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Maybe this movie is to close the bone of reality to gain the support it should have received. It is like a ladder of growing violence with well-past pauses of peace and serenity between each step. A great movie ....
