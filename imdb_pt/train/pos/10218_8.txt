We have to remember that the 1950s were pretty much a gap when it came to movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, noir, two reels, etc. for movies with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. Some people may think this was an improvement. I do not. Who was the tycoon who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? Was he right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than some kind of remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This is a pip. It's about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's inheritance. One of them, perhaps the only one worth redeeming is the help of the company's pilot to help keep the rest of the family at bay. He is initially into the dollars but eventually falls in love with her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family plans to sabotage the novel. The results are predictable. You get a little bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing. We never got to know the parents, but they really must have been deceived. The cast is virtually unknown. One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar. The acting is so bad it's hard to believe. It was released under the umbrella United Artists by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was filmed in Los Angeles, especially at night and probably without permission. The ending was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene. <br /> <br /> I can not explain it - not even to myself - but I gave that pile of junk an 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad it's good," but I do not think I've ever come across the phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this certainly fits. You might want to try this if you like movies that seem to have been made in someone's basement.
