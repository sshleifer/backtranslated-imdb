Is it a good idea to use live animals for department store windows? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why ... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned" the sale that Bugs is helping to promote is over and the store manager (Nelson) is transferring it to a new department: taxidermy. Of course, the Bugs have fun and the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Using almost every department of the store (children's clothing, sports, shoes, costumes, women's sweaters - do not ask), Bugs comes out on top each time, even referring to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE ". Even when stuck on the edge of an elevator, Bugs takes full advantage of the situation. Director Jones is at the top of his pictorial game as always, as are Blanc (as Bugs, natch) and Nelson (the manager - who sounds like one of the top radio guys, Gildersleeves - ask his grandparents). <br /> <br /> And a wise advice: When confronted by a diffuse-looking woman wanting to try bathroom slippers, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner," the best argument for animal labor laws.
