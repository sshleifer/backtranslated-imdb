A compelling, honest, daring and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape - "Descent" is a film that went unnoticed because of its lack of distribution because, frankly, the film is so brutal in its that if it had been released in theaters, it may have encountered a strong prejudice hatred. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be discovered not only for its dark themes, and not just for its incredible direction and authentic style - but above all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, bringing enough sickness and vulnerability enough to make one, not to relate, but to understand this fractured man with a distorted perspective of his sexuality not only with the women he rapes but also with the fragile insecurities inside from yourself. . It is a supportive performance that is so complex, courageous and emotional on the part of Faust. It's hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A tour-de-force of realistic dramatic tics, and one of the more subtle, but high-to-be performances in some time. While Dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some amazing movies, she proves here that she has what it takes to deliver some thrilling and thrilling performances, convincingly and thematically. best films of his year (and 2007 was a fort) - if this underrated and clever film hit the theatrical release, I would be shouting praises for him, as well as Dawson and Faust. Too bad that was too overwhelming for a generalized appeal. Movies like this deserve better!
