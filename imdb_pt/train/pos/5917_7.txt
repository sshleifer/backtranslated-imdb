Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very original film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's a cinema weirdo and it's worth seeing. It's live action mixed with animation, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary Southern Song, almost as if it were an answer to that movie. Philip Michael Thomas, who will later become Don Johnson's partner in Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Illuminated, are prison fugitives. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are friends of Thomas and plan to help him escape from prison. They are trapped in a police barrier, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear, and a fox moving from south to Harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence. The story is lively and provides many wonderful things to see. Like all of Bakshi's films, most will be bored and will not like the animation. True lovers of animation will forgive their clunkiness and fall in love with their inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexual, and it's mostly about battles between races. For a long time, I thought I was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I just watched, it started to look like another blacksploitation movie, along the lines of Superfly. He is very sloppy and does not say anything. Besides, is Bakshi not white? Whatever the answer to that, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth a lot of watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans. 7/10
