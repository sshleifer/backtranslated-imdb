Finally! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, a fun black comedy with subversive youngsters who subtly kick the 'system' in the butt. It's all about football and it's funny, it's really funny. The director says, "The seats are real, the event is real, as are the characters and the extras. That's why I purposely chose not to use professional actors because their presence would have introduced a notion of falsehood." Non-actors will have you rooting for them immediately, unless: your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with almost absurd freshness. He won the Jury Grand Prix in Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it's almost perfect. Where can I get this?
