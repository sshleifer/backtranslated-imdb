Why are not more directors able to create horror films like "The Enlightened One"? There is an easy answer to this: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once and for all with this film he is truly one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> So the plot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family move to a large and isolated hotel to take care of the off-season. The kicker is that the hotel's previous janitor brutally murdered his wife and two girls. The following can easily be summed up by the title of the film, but you have to watch to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in a long time to seem "scary" to me. "The song has been an important part of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely does not disappoint with this.The score completely sets the tone and this movie would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must comment on the legendary performance of Nicholson. is terribly convincing as a crazy killer. <br /> <br /> In fact, only your gaze steals some scenes from this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a high level performance that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror movie that STOP IN PEACE Stanley.
