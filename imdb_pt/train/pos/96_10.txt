I was reviewing some old VHS tapes and I came across the John Denver TV show and the Muppets A Christmas Together. This made me go to my computer and refer to it to see if I could find a DVD version of this program to buy. I was disappointed that I could not find it on DVD yet. The show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the disk and the CD, but I would love to buy a DVD version of this program. The tape is old and the picture quality is very good, but faded, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some other songs not placed on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and the Muppets, a DVD of this show would be a really good seller. If you do not have the CD, it's a wonderful collection of songs from that show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a turntable to play it.
