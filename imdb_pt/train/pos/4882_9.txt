It's a funny business, review movies. Nowadays, when "internalized emotions" and "emotional distancing" are favored over direct sentimentality, it must be difficult to remain faithful to their true feelings. <br /> <br /> Soon after completing the jury's duties at the 58th Berlinale, I was able to pick up Yoji Yamada's Kabei. After the screening, I saw people dreamily come out of the theater room, wide-eyed, men, women, and critics. Even the director of the Berlinale, obviously a moviegoer, confessed to being taken by surprise and found himself crying three quarters of his experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me were the comments that came later. Though ineffably moved by the film, many critics have chosen to be tepid and emotionally uncompromising in their texts. Apparently, after crying, they put on their "thinking cap" and consequently lost what I felt to be the genius about Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. In prewar Japan, the story of Kabei revolves around the family of a writer and his fate after he is arrested because of what has been described as "crimes of thought" against the imperial will . Through a series of prolonged emotional scenes, Yamada leaves us familiar with the man, his loyal wife and two daughters, as well as three minor characters - the man's younger sister, a bumbling ex-student, and an uncle? ? all come to help the family deal with their suffering in the absence of the man of the house. <br /> <br /> History progresses at a slow but steady pace, and sorrows occur precisely at times when all can predict. This, of course, makes it almost impossible for anyone in the audience to get very emotionally disturbed by any dramatic event. In other words, although you learn to love your family and your helpers, and sympathize with your unhappy situation, you get so overwhelmed by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself waiting for a particular kind of ending. <br /> <br /> However, two hours in the film (do not worry, Yamada gives the viewer enough moments of gravity and lightness to help him), it hits you with what I can only describe as "the sting". All you assumed to be what the story was about an innocent man ripped from his faithful wife and daughters? Now he suddenly points to one of the family's helpers. Someone you so far take for granted is now launched in an unexpected twist of fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, something curious happened in the theater where I was. Everyone began to sob with little or no inhibition. /> <br /> "My word!" I murmured under my breath. It seemed to me then that "Kabei" was ultimately more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire at the brink of war. It was, in fact, an astute examination of an ordinary human: how little we care about the secret feelings of the people who are closest to us. <br /> <br /> Now the most common criticism of the film was that it was technically sound but lacked innovation. That's what happens when the reviewers put their proverbial thinking limit on, I guess. With Kabei, I believe that Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he would employ to touch on a unique aspect of humanity. An old trick that he applied so perfectly in the Tora-san series and later in the Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After taking the audience to a kind of narrative comfort zone, it throws us into a realm of emotions. rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> That, to me, is the most effective cinematic tool of all. One that avoids detection, but it affects you deeply. And the proof of its effectiveness were a thousand pieces of tissue, tossed in a litter near the theater of a thousand places. <br /> <br /> Now if only a few critics would resist being so involved in being smart they forget what the movie really is. Human emotions. Pure and simple.
