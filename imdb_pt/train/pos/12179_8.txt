I watched this movie by chance a few days ago while browsing the channels. My expectation was not very high, but it was an interesting film. In 'A Guy Thing', Jason Lee plays Paul, a Seattle guy who is about to marry his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) and settle into an undeniable life of middle-class domesticity. We met for the first time with Paul in his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to engage in normal bachelor party activities that his (surprisingly few) friends encourage, if he's a bit naughty. and strife. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is that the next morning the night before he is in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother-in-law phones to let him know that Karen is on the way. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen's cousin, Becky (Julia Stiles). <br/> <br/> From this little seed of potential problems grows a mighty oak of frantic misfortune, while Paul plays misfortune to misfortune, trying to cover up what he did while maintaining the appearance of being a good family-oriented boy , who is very excited about their upcoming nuptials. Her efforts to ensure that Karen remains the wisest of any possible malaise on her part, ironically, forces Paul to come closer to the amused Becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been planned for he. . The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth watching.
