I love the latest episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also enjoyed the plot with Kate falling for the director. I want to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family next. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandpa. I've always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's a credit to his acting that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and I totally believe in him as Kate's father. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written in the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitive and lovingly treated. But usually a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun.
