Richard Brooks' 1967 film from Truman's novel Capote IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect piece for Oscar-winning performance Philip Seymour Hoffman in the 2005 CAPTURE. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). It's unusual to find movies made 38 years apart so well. These two actually improve each other. Even though different actors play the role of the killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two parts blend well. Only part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name from Capote. I would suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It makes a powerful experience!
