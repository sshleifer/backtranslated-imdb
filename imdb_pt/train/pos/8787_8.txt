This movie has increased my opinion of Errol Flynn. Although Flynn is best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to create a couple of fallacious European terms!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (though only slightly) as an actor, since he plays a brazen social climber with a great ego and a sense of courage to match. The support cast is excellent; all seem well chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> History moves quickly, and although it is not particularly profound (it lacks, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to make social commentaries about the massively uneven distribution of income during this time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also fairly true to the story. I also really enjoyed the great representations of the 1880s in San Francisco. All in all, just do not like about this movie ... very well worth the time to watch it.
