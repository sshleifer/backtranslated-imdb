I liked Top Gun. That interested me. Predictable plot, decent character development and plot. It is very similar to High Noon, in which the people of the city seem weak and afraid of facing a villain. This movie has some quality actors who did not really have a chance to share all their talents. In addition, some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man in his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are excellent in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nauseating character. She seemed flattered that two men were fighting over her. Ugh Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
