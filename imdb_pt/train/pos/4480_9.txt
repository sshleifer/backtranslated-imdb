In The Book of the Films series of The Citterns of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a musical mastermind. I certainly can not do better than this. It's such an important film in the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do much harm either. Louis B. Mayer lent Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn was inspired to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers, and because of that, Cover Girl became a classic. So, if Mayer did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly's artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dance rival for the monarch of the movie dance. <br /> <br /> The number one that everyone talks to Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to make the number with the Mickey Mouse from Walt Disney, but Disney was not lending Mickey to anyone. Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit made an external film. Do not worry, because MGM had its own animated rodent, half of the Tom and Jerry team. <br /> <br /> Kelly, as a dancer, always struggled to do something new and different on the screen, as did Fred Astaire. For the next twelve years, both were allowed to have all sorts of artistic control and were praised for their work, even if the films were not adequate. It was as if each inspired a bigger and better creativity, Kelly to MGM, Astaire to MGM and many other studios. At Anchors Aweigh, Kelly made Sinatra dance a little. In fact, Frank Sinatra always credited Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be made, as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for his help in winning his Oscar for From Here to Eternity. <br /> When Frank Sinatra got half of his contract purchased from RKO by MGM, he insisted on a bit of artistic creativity on his own. He became friends with the team of composers Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography, Sammy Cahn tells how Sinatra insisted that they write their songs for this movie. Louis B. Mayer relented and the team wrote some very good ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite numbers of Sinatra comes from Anchors Aweigh, I fall in love very easily. Frank sings accompanying himself to the piano in an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at his best. With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more lyrics in the mouth of Frank Sinatra than anyone else. They were lifelong friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this breakthrough in his career. <br /> <br /> On a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song using only a chromatic scale. They proved this in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. She also did some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here, singing is in fact the basis of the plot. Two sailors on leave for a combination of circumstances meet with Kathryn Grayson and his orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix her up with Sinatra, Kelly says he can audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the movie trying to accomplish just that. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment at Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn', never received a number. She had praise for her performance as Meg Brockie on Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion that she had a number that was hacked and somewhere in the MGM vaults it still might be. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals are no longer made. All that creative talent was under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If you had to pay market value for this, the cost could recover from the debt of some third world countries. <br /> <br /> But the results of the film would be extraordinary.
