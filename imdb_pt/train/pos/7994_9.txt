I really liked this movie. it's dark, it's not a bullet escape, chasing cars numbing your brain-action movie. Many characters and backgrounds are a bit vague, letting the viewer come to their own conclusions. it is good to see a film in which the director allows the viewer to make their own opinions. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge, or a desire to repent - it does what it feels to be "right." "Will God ever forgive us for what we have done?" - it is not a question that mortal men can answer - then he does what he thinks he has to do, what he is good at, what he has been trained to do. denzel washington is a great actor - I honestly can not think of a bad movie he did - and he has a great supporting cast. I completely recommend this movie to anyone.
