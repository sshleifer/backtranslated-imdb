Jafar Panahi's dramatic comedy "Offside" portrays some women attempting to enter the Tehran sports arena, from which women are banned. The official reason: lots of foul language, and football players have their legs showing up. But, of course, it's really a case of sexism. So most of the film consists of mild comic relief as women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium, and a woman even creates her own scheme to challenge men. <br /> <br /> From what I understand, all the Jafar Panahi films (this included) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's overthrow of the prime minister in 1953 and subsequent support of the brutal Shah gave the Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinistic society, and that the current policy of George W. Bush against Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to act with the cowboy and increase censorship. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this is a cool look for people who come up with ways to challenge the system. Not a great movie, but worth seeing. Since all Jafar Panahi movies are banned, I wonder how he is able to do them.
