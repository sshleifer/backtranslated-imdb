I remember watching Sabrina when she came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I am now 24 years old and still love it now as much as I did when I first saw it. I get a little straw from some of my friends for attending a "children's show", but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my favorite character and later Morgan also became another of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time watching several special events in honor of Sabrina on the Nickeleoden TV station in the UK. I love Joan-Hart Mellissa, she was great at "Clarrissa Explains All", but much better at it. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I will be the first in line! lol x
