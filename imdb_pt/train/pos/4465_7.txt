ANCHORS AWEIGH is a fun MGM musical that fans of the genre will like, but I would not rate it with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two Hollywood-licensed sailors who make friends with a young man (Dean Stockwell) who introduces them to actress and young aunt (Kathryn Grayson), an actress who is working as an extras at MGM. Although both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually prefers Joe, but Clarence later meets up with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who, he learns, is from her hometown of Brooklyn. The fine paper plot leaves room for several major musical numbers, including "We Hate to Leave," Joe and Clarence mourn their fellow sailors as they are leaving the ship; Grayson's torrid version of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's dreamy version of "I Fall in Love Too Easily" (a number that unfortunately has been erased from some of the film's prints), and "The Worry Song," a fantasy dance that Kelly does with Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry . . Kelly also does a sort of costume ballet from Kissing Bandit, which rivals her Pirate's Ballet in THE PIRATE. Kelly is in great shape here in a robust and energetic performance that earned her her only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's timidly affectionate character is undeniably sexy. Fun fun for fans of MGM's music factory.
