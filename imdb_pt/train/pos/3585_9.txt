Excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football "stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, mate? How much can you lose if you stallion for an innocent girl? Can you love to beat the odds? Can you defeat narrow-minded small-town people? When your friend scores and you "lose," will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it, or will you be a man about it and respect your right to choose? Are you going to rape her and show her as your victory over a "troublesome" girl? Can you stand alongside who is the only sin is to have an opinion of their own, to be able to make their own decisions, choose for themselves? This made me think twice before giving my judgment on who was right and who was wrong, but it sure is a movie and very disturbing subject in general. Thumb up!
