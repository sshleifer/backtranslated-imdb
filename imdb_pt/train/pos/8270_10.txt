This is an extraordinary film that constantly deceives you. It seems to be going into clich√© at various points, and then something amazing will happen that genuinely frightens. It would give a lot to say a lot more, but stick with this movie and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be rediscovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is incredible - there's even a scene where Haines scrubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors interpret this subtext subtly and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very touching. And I never thought I could get as involved in a football game as I did in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Also excellent is the rival of Francis X. Bushman, Ralph as Haines for the girl (yes, it's not quite a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - a great example of the 1920s commercial cinema with an edge.
