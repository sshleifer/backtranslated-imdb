This movie is incredible. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, it's amount of "guys" and "right ons" brings laughter and faint memories of about 15 years ago. I like his ability to make me laugh with obvious jokes and nonsense, and his ability to make me want to watch his forerunner, "The Excellent Adventure of Bill and Ted" (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and totally mature humor, do not watch; however, if you want a movie that is humorous and silly, but smart and engaging, you'll have fun. I really wish more of this kind of picture appeared in today's theaters. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone would parody him as acting ... right ... it does not get much better than that :)
