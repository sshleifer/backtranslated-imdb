yes I have a copy of it in uncut VHS in great condition that I transferred to DVD and if anyone wants to bring back the memories of a classic Christmas please emilhe me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i sought everywhere and I I did not find anything in it and I thought that I can not be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape, there have to be other people and if I fit with them being very few that have this classic, then I consider myself lucky and I have all the Christmas muppets except one that John Denver did with the muppets again, I think it's called a smokey mountain holiday im not sure but its next.
