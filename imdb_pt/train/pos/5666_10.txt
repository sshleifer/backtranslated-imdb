I loved this show when it was aired on television and it was crushed when I discovered that someone somewhere decided it was not worthy of being continued! For years I hung on my copies of this show, the ones I had recorded or had someone for me. That is until now. The powers that finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally managed to put my anxious hands on the complete set. Which brings me to this part; The part about what this show is about. <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about good evil verses, basically a fight between Lucas Buck (who is Buck, with a B). He's an evil sheriff from a small town in South Carolina who runs things the way he wants things to be run and stops at nothing to get him what he wants. <br /> <br /> I felt that the show was beautifully written and directed and had lots of life yet to be lived. I really hated it when it was canceled, but that's how it seems to be for me when I finally find something worth watching on television. <br /> Gary Cole did a great job as Sheriff Lucas Buck. , he has the right amount of charm and verse that evil does. The other actors did a great job too, so I guess you could tell, even the cast was a hit with me.
