Babyface - Barbara Stanwyck's notorious film, where she is told by the kind of local teacher she has power - he tries to get her to read Nietzche - she says the books have never done her any good. We soon discovered that his father is basically a pimp. she went to a local politician and others.Finally she had enough and reallocates to the big city.I follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.The dialogue is quite cheeky for this is time and was a the latest films to come out before the self-inflicted Hollywood production code. Seek a special guest appearance from John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's volunteer victims. Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version - the DVD has the two most Red- Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge. An interesting film and I foretell for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the film noir era. B +
