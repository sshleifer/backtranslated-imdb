As the celebration of Christmas has evolved over the years, whether it focuses on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people should behave a little better with each other. This somehow escaped an Ebenezer Scrooge, money merchant and financier in 19th century London. <br /> <br /> As his nephew points to his uncle, he does not keep Christmas at all because Scrooge feels it all. It's farce. Humanity in Scrooge was expelled long ago, he is a difficult case, much like his 20th century colleague, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls in New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, Redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas Carol is such a timeless vacation classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a 19th century social commentary of Britain as Oliver Twist was. The characters in this movie are middle class and low. The Cratchits are a couple of steps above the street people in Oliver Twist, but they're having to struggle to stay up there. Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for. Like George Bailey, who did very well in his life and just had to be reminded of how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed an alert as to the potentiality he still had to do something good about it. The old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart, in his live performances and filming, practically took on the role of Scrooge. But George C. Scott captures the old miser very well in this movie. His pettiness, but with a trace of sadness that makes us hope for him to change. Scott joins a good tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, who made excellent interpretations of Scrooge. Among the supporting roles, I particularly liked David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as an enthusiastic and harsh spirit of the Christmas present. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that have been archived and is one of the best.
