This film leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story. I also can not understand why people could ruin this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, this movie may not be right for you. <br /> <br /> This film shows a high degree of realism. . The performance of the actors and actresses is exemplary. It's not fake, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, special effects so special. <br /> <br /> The camera work is great, the music is so good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It makes your body numb like Constant Garderner. The one directly has raw talent, certainly not a follower.
