Love Trap is not a short, it's obviously a full length feature with a runtime of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> As I write this, I might as well tell you a little more about Love Trap. I often wonder what makes Love Trap different ... this is how I answer that question: 1) It introduces characters - one in particular - that have never been seen before in the movie, period. <br /> <br /> 2) Reveals more truth about love, and plunges deeper into the very concept of love, than any other US film ever made, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as in the way history is told, it is unlike any love story you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) Provides extremely timely insights into various cultural issues, inside and outside the black community. <br /> <br /> Over time, people will see the Trap of Love as a totally original work in this age, deliciously refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a joke of rare morality, full of ideas to think about. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this film.
