Lost holds something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been said, so I will not be the one to spell it all out for you again. Just read the people you love and you will know why you want to watch. The cool thing about this series is that it's brand new. There are not many movies - and still less - based on the theme of just suspense, but Lost lives with pride on the theme. It's all about the inexplicable and if you combine this with an exotic location, nice twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined into single episodes) you will have a series in which each episode is a story on its own, but part of a greater revelation. You want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you will want to know where the writers are taking you. The result of this is that it's a series that will not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series fell a bit in the second season, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was only written for a season originally and when overwhelming success followed, the writers were impressed too. In my opinion they made the mistake of adding even more mysteries and at a higher pace in Season 2, then solving the (or at least partially) those of Season 1. At the end of season 2 you ended up with a great blurr of secrets, twists and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much that a viewer can do. The difference between Season 2 and Season 3 was huge. The third season distributed many insights to partially replace them with new questions. And that is exactly how they should write; you want to stray from one plot twist to the next, do not get a tsunami of secrets scattered about you and then catch some to explain to the viewers. They got it in season three and bring us a promising future for Season 4. It's good to see that a format so different from a series can be so popular.
