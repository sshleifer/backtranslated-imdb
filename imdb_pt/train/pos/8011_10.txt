This was the best Muppet movie I have ever seen! I happen to know that Miss Piggy's fantasy of getting to know each other as babies was the cause of the Muppet babies. The songs will stay in my head forever. Just saying that because this stupid Nickelodeon shows the song Hey Dude still remains in my head. Sorry, a little off topic there. But anyway what I like is Animal after the credits saying "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! See You Later!" It made me laugh so hard. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the characters from Sesame Street appeared at the wedding. I'm glad that this movie was a lot of fun. I borrowed it from the library and now I bought it because I can not keep the library copy forever. In conclusion, I proclaim that this is the best movie I have ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers at Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
