I think this movie has a lot to recommend it, particularly a particularly sinister performance by David Morse and a more than reasonable performance, always worth watching Mr. Foxx. Although there are many holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, after all, it does a good time in front of the tube.
