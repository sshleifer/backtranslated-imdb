Fascinating but disturbing look for Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent-infested mansion, which was considered a health hazard by the city. It is very clear very quickly that these two are very eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the best of all, since it acts with the mentality of a child of ten years, in spite of being 53 years old. The content is basically composed of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie Lick Big Edie by fending off all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions often become very rhetorical, meaningless, and often amusing. The second part consists of long periods of singing attempt by both parties. Each of them thinks their singing is perfect and it's just the other that sounds bad. In an incredible scene, Big Edie actually attacks Little Edie physically with her cane just to make her stop with it. Very captivating, however, we get the feeling that there is a serious exploration going on here and the affairs are far away to meet you. Filmmakers seem to treat this as a show of horrors at the circus, arriving every day to record (and laugh) at any bizarre behavior that may arise. Ultimately, this is a sad image because it shows how the world simply went through those two. Their hopes and dreams have decayed like the mansion in which they live. Despite their disputes, these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from solitude. The most incredible line comes from Big Edie, whose many cats relieve themselves throughout their bedroom. His response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
