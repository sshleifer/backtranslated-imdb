I've seen a few movies about eating disorders, but this was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders in the end just automatically improve or accept the fact that they need help and that. this movie I thought was more realistic because in this case the main character Lexi not only improves automatically. It gets better and then it has a drawback. I think this movie shows more than the others I've seen that improving does not just happen, it's hard work and it takes time, it's a long road to recovery. I think this movie shows it all very well. There should be more movies like that.
