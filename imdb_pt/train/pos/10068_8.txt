This movie was excellent. A sad truth about how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just a great type of fuzzy film. You have the master who is rich in tradition and kind in his own way, Puppy, although it is a girl thing to win your affections and you end up with a cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. That equates to a great happy movie in the end. This movie does a good job of showing how immersed in tradition a person can be, so rich that he is willing to die without sharing his secrets. You see the sides of a culture never seen before, which helps to improve the drama that unfolds near the end of the image. Film photography is excellent, particularly the opening parade sequence with all the sparks. Thank you for being in the Oscar for best foreign film.
