This movie is the first of six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who was captured and tortured in several different ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without the return address, and includes a manga video, showing the torture. The men who catch her are testing the limits of a human before they die. Some scenes are shocking, like the eyeball scene and others are not shocking as the girl being punched 100 times because you see punches in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of gore, so I would recommend this to people aged 17 or over. <br /> <br /> 9/10
