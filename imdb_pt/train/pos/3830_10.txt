The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie, we were watching Alex Winter for the "Bill & Ted" fame. We did not know what to expect besides who and what it was about. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, although not completely accurate historically, was and is the best of its kind. I've seen other movies describing the history of this famous summer and in my opinion, none of the others can compare. He left out some details, but these parts did not take away the sheer elegance and romance of the story. I've seen the other movies over this summer and I think most of them are good, but none as catchy as this. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has the qualities of a painting. The colors and scenery seem to be something that would be found on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric house. The costumes were beautiful, and although they were not the most comfortable clothes in the world, they made me want to find a seamstress to make this outfit for me. The whole movie was set in the picturesque Lake Geneva (where I hope to go one day to see this film) and the serenity that these historical figures found there. <br /> <br /> This film shows, in addition to the tranquility encountered by all the fugitives of the harsh judgments of England, the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice during this time, when drugs were not illegal. And the ingestion of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was medicinal and also recreational. Shelley was suffering from consumption. Lord Byron suffered the pains of a beaten foot. It was not surprising that there were prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in his possession that summer. And they were poets during a time when experience was the key. There was no time for prudent prudence. Passion and experience were a big part of the Romantic Era. And out of the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at the time) played by the beautiful and talented Alice Krige. It is the controlling factor for everything that happens until it also yields to experience. But it stands firm and experiences things on its own terms. How was the strength she inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses were perfect for the parts they played. The music montage. The direction captured the essence of summer, as I read about it. This film was based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you liked this movie, read the book. The author takes the story of what she has gathered from Mary Godwin Shelley's diaries and the other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even small inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and goth, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the birth of the monster, which even today teaches us about the "play of God" morality. <br /> <br /> A definitive movie must be seen!
