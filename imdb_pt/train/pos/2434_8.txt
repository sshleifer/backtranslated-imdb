I always wondered how much CASPER was for children ... with all the problems related to their identity (in this film we are led to believe that it is the spirit of a dead child, since their house is a graveyard plot), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film. Maybe Casper was more of a morality prank, or Famous Studios wanted to break new ground in "reality" comics. <br /> <br /> THERE'S GOOD TIME TODAY is a very lively project - no doubt there. But the development of the plot involving the fox (who becomes friends with Casper but finds a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Give credit to famous studios - they face death with respect ... but, austere The image of Casper's mourning is quite graphic and disturbing for children (although the outcome offers a happy ending, but I will not reveal the ending), and the violence is quite steep, even by the 1940s. <br /> <br /> This can be a good cartoon for parents to use to help explain death to the kids - but I would not put it on the VCR for a joyful break.
