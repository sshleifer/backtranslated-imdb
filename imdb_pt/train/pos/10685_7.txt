This film has a clear plot, which is quite unusual for the musical genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera" and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical, since they use literary works like structure. The plot of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the core of human relations, especially those of the Indonesian people. Although the film is based on a supposedly fairytale, it is actually a fantasy of the "child" in Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how the Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of dancing, not discouraging the fact that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more Westernized. The dance sequences seem clumsy in some ways and not synchronized with music and / or music. However, I still love this film and I see it as a new wave of the Indonesian film genre that I hope to improve in the future.
