I originally saw this very dark comedy about 2000 on cable. What a surprise and pleasure! Everyone is secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss interprets the "mental" gift (remember the gift of New York that should be schizophrenic? Does art imitate life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and should not joke! Proving thus beauty and endurance go together! Then there's the big scene of "bullshit" between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play out of the "bullshit" world. This film is both subtle and bald. For the whole shooting, it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near-final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva It's not a movie at all. But, if you like a movie that has a lot of wordplay and keeps moving without blowing it all away, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert dumps this movie. He is completely wrong. This is a great movie! Maybe not just one for Ebert. I consider this as a 10 because of how well this is done and how funny the script can be, although it's not really a kind of direct comedy movie. I liked it so much that I bought it on DVD because it is not very displayed on cable. It's all mine now!
