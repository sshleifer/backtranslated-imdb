An interesting TV movie based on real facts, betrayed by the description of one of the main characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate task of deciding whether to appeal to the courts for his brother's death sentence. But when he goes to visit him and enters into Elijah Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas' ability to perform. It just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "G.Q." magazine, with a very sophisticated language for someone who spent most of his life behind the bars. This perception came to me after meeting again an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, that he passed in various Panamanian chains. The young man I knew was gone, not only because he is older, but because of his long-term exposure to the penal system. There are chains and chains, it should be said, but this prisoner in "Shot In the Heart" is definitely out of this world.
