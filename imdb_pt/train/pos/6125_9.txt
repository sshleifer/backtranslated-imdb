Okay, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and thought to myself, this sounds interesting. I rent and take it home. Boy, I was right, it's interesting. They put serial killer spirits into dreams, ambulant corpses and into everyday machines. But this has to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the snowman friendly pictures scattered around the landscape, the pan holder, the snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he put some fun into a killer really not seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said that. FREDDY KRUGGER It's this level of "legal". I wish some of the effects of the puppets were better, the movements of the mouth could have been better. But I attribute this to a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some great liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump. Everything and everyone, a great story, good effects, great dialogue and a great cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
