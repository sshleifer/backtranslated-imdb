WOW. One of the biggest movies I've ever seen - I've seen it. <br /> <br /> Absolutely LOVED! Before the opening credits were over, I was glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a science fiction thriller - and the edge of its Whodunnit seat. Amazing. <br /> <br /> I wish it would never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a disposable paper. Anyone could have played. The lead actor, Jeremy Northram, was the perfect nerd guy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me, I loved War Games, Tennis and Track. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06. Walt D in LV
