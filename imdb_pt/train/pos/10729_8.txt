Some summer space campers were accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was ending. They had to send someone to a space station to pick up the gas tanks, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this movie is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling to anything that is possible if you put your heart in. It's amazing to see these young actors who still look the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in the year 2000, it was filmed in 1986) There are some people in this movie who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was great sidereal space. It does not seem unreal. It's about 2 hours long, runs so fast you will not even notice. You know this is not real, but you end up being sucked in until the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
