Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. But when the son takes his father to 3000 miles for his pilgrimage to Mecca, the talks finally take place. they are difficult and growth is needed on both sides. <br /> <br /> This film takes us to the heart of these two travelers, and is indeed a great journey for the public as well as for the two directors. The pictures are stunning, especially the final scenes in Mecca. Emphasize to me once again how different the world may be, but also, at the same time, how similar. The same thing happened with the father and the son in this film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see them. You'll be glad you did it.
