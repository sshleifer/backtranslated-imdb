Okay, so the FX does not have a high budget. But this story is based on real events. It is not something thrown together to make a couple of rich, even richer actors! Like most book-based movies, there are things that simply do not fit. Only a few people have stated that this movie was based on actual events, not as an imitation, as most people believe it to be !! This movie is not in any way related also TWISTER! In addition to both movies are about tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have trouble with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember ... The real "night of the twisters" was on June 3 of 1980. So this film was released 16 years after the actual events. Try to think to what extent storm research has advanced in this period. It happened in a larger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Even though the movie calls the city something else, it says it's a small town.
