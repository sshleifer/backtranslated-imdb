Riget II is a good sequel, but not as good as the first. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first. However, there is much more comedy about it, good. <br /> <br /> We are back to the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse is about to leave the hospital while her work is done, but fate wants it to be otherwise. She is soon chasing ghosts and Helmer is making everyone crazy and will soon get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story involves much more comedy than the previous one. Of course, a lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. The story retained many elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are kind of silly, but they save you more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's a strange story and scenario. Some parts are a show of total aberration and the characters change during the show so as to keep it serious and keeping it real is not an easy task. However, these actors deal perfectly with this whole situation. <br /> <br /> Many of the good qualities of the first series are kept intact. Cinematography is one of these qualities. The hand camera that made the world famous of Trier gives suspense and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier makes use of these abilities. Good movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see better effect in this sequence than the first. Also be prepared to see a little more. I did not think that green thing seemed too good. I thought it was not original and did not fit. Never, effects like ghosts are really good. Non-digital effects are also good. Little brother seems just very strange, but you accept. All the time I would say that the effects are OK to good. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. Moody and cool. Some of them are really touching. This fits great. As the first there is little music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All together, this makes a good sequel. If you had seen Riget, you can see this without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two form a series that you do not want to miss.
