This is one of my favorite Mr. Motorcycles, and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming self as the elegant Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator, the usual comic relief is quite funny here, and there are many suspects in whom to cast an eye. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not have the same talent as Thomas Beck, the second leader usual in these programmers, but he is suitable. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and while he speaks in a stereotypical way, his lines are funny, not diminishing his intelligence, and he really saves the day in his brief time on the screen.
