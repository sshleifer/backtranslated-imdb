This movie is the reason why I found this site. I could not find this movie anywhere else! I'm so glad we found it here! We've seen this on TV before and we desperately wanted to find it and buy it and have several friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it is annoying, although I must say that it is NOT. Especially if you are a horse person, you will love this movie. The horses are amazing, well trained and the film is well done. It is certainly one that we will be buying for our DVD library at home. We will be recommending it to our friends. The bond between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a movie that we watch several times.
