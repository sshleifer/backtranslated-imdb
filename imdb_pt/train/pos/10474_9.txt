I was incredibly impressed with this movie. It contained fundamental elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just about a genius musician who hit rock bottom, but it was about a man stuck in regret trying to drastically find solace within his music. He finds a companion who comes with his own problems. Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but more importantly, a conclusion about the events that shaped their life for the worse. <br /> <br /> Des is a character unlikely by the current standards of a rock star. However, he has musical genius. He also has an event in his past that made him stagnate while things around him literally go to the ruins. His focus is to create his whale music, in fact, it becomes an obsession for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is the street kid who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while in the company of Des. She also meets a mutual friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him for a period of time. <br /> <br /> These two find love with each other. It is not the kind of passion that blows the mind, the infused sex, but a love where friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have been injured, they find trust together.
