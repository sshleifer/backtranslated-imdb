.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to old Burton who read Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" as a search for his preparation to direct Batman in 1988-89? It seems that Burton did not search the book or the film because he did it all wrong! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and does not handle the same subject as the original. If you want a good movie monkey watch the original. <br /> <br /> ** out of stars ****
