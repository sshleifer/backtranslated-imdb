This movie is great. The plot is very faithful to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a group of boys called "when you touch the big toe on the moon." It reminds me of Sinatra's High Hopes song, it's fun and inspiring. The music is great and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great date film. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye at Jester Court then you definitely will like this movie.
