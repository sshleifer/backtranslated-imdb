This is not only one of Jackie Chan's greatest films, but also one of the greatest kung-fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We started to expect crazy acrobatics and fast, creative action in Chan. movies, and this one reference set for the others to follow. It's two hours of pure entertainment, which impresses all the time. <br /> <br /> As well as superb action, we have a viable plot and persuasive characters, with Chan taking what seems to be a more Western approach to writing, mixing Eastern resolution methods (ie kicking butt). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's funny, serious, fun and innovative. A must for any kung-fu fan while at the same time remaining accessible to the broader reaches of the film community.
