I had waited a long time for this film since seeing the trailer, which made it look like a political drama starring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And despite being run by Harold Becker, who did an uneven job, he and Pacino teamed up in SEA OF LOVE, which is among their best work. But the interference on some level (to start with, several of the scenes in the original trailer do not appear in the movie) and the change of tone (subsequent trailers make it seem like a thriller) make this, while watchable, has not been up close. <br /> <br /> Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a movie about how the government can still be worth it, despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about this corruption, not the good guys at all against villains. And there is good acting here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is wasted in his role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central plot, when it becomes a thriller, the movie loses its course, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls completely in the end. I wish I could enjoy it more, but no.
