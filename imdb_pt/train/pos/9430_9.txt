I am a member of a canoeing club and I can tell you the truth that Liberation is synonymous with the tranquility and tranquility of the experience. When we put our boats in the water, the banjos echo at the bottom of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it is philosophical of the human place in nature and effect of technology on man's relationship with nature. We see this in bow fishing. We see this in the homemade tent. There is also the disdain and sense of superiority of the city man over the rural cracker. The fact that the Atlanta banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" intends to put him on the same level as lumberjacks who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle of life and death replaces the assumptions of "civilized man" about "The Law." This canoe trip ends too early for the viewer, but unfortunately is not enough for the characters.
