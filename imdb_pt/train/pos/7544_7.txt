Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to go out with movies like these, movies that end on hard drives for anime fans and college students, but are completely ignored by just about anyone. outside their country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those movies that, in the eyes of the West, is supposed to be tried with drugs or deeply analyzed. It's really just a beautifully detailed surreal journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue, which makes it easy to convey to other interested parties disinterested in things like subtitles. A cat and its half-dead sister (brain-dead?) Travel through various landscapes of imagination and association. Is there a general theme of water, or lack thereof (possibly because of the cat drowning in the beginning? Possibly because of the title?). There is an interesting type of Genesis. There is a pig that eats alone. An elephant made of water. And it's beautiful, irresistible, exciting and fun - as long as you do not see it around junkies who can not experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid journey. Eventually, the film shuts off, adding another convincing self-reflective level to the process. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
