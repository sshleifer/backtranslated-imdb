I am totally surprised with some comments on this forum and many of the comments. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it's highly stylized, flashy, and exaggerated, but it's a lot of fun. I'm happy at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for anyone but if you like over-the-top, black humor, legal action and dialogue, you should see. <br /> <br /> I've seen Scott Fireman, Red Tide and State Enemy - all good movies, but I like this one the most. It's like a roller coaster, with great soundtrack selections, visual styles and at a time when all the movies look like pg13, it's good to see that someone is not afraid to show nudity, bloody violence and have explicit dialogues. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt that Keira is super hot, and even shows nipples in this, too ...
