Kate Beckinsale is as good, if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, although I really like Gwyneth Paltrow in the other version of Emma. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting, almost nonetheless. And I also liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie better ... she was more incredibly sweet and sentimental. There are certain things that I like more about the version of Gwyneth Paltrow, however, as the comic side is more apparent.
