I chose this one on a whim of the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. A lot of rigorous and expressionist camera work, an equally rigid script and two superb actors merge to create a very good movie. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but the real fan of cinema. If Hollywood ever gets his hands dirty, I'm sure it will ruin him. A choice to treat all the way around. Other posters here have more than praised, so I do not have to worry about duplicating their books; just take your advice, and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call what you like; I call it two hours of well spent entertainment. Read my lips: do not miss it.
