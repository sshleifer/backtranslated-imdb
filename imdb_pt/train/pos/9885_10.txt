The young Erendira and her tyrannical grandmother provide a great fantasy of the new world. This interpretation by Gabriel García Márquez, "The incrivelible sad story of Cándida Eréndira, ..." may not rub the purists of Márquez in the right way even if the story remains intact and still carries the full force of the work. The strength of this film is in its acting especially Popes as the grandmother. Márquez fans and Marquez's newcomers will appreciate this movie for their real brand of witt.
