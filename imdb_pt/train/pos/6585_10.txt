After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should demonstrate such a concept to the point of imagining that he could get close to Brett's portrait of "one of the most interesting characters in literature." Jeremy Brett It's Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be no other. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a close second, but it is still the second. It could be argued that Rathbone's scripts were inferior to the absolutely superior productions that allowed Mr. Brett, and to that I would agree. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will forever and forever be the only actor to truly become "Sherlock Holmes". The book must be closed on this subject and we, the public, set out to enjoy the unique performances of Mr.Brett. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
