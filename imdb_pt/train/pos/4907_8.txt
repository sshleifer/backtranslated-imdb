A well-made and imaginative production, refreshingly clich√©-free, this rather picaresque affair tells the story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy on less than ideal terms: the man a convict fugitive who kidnapped the young man for value as a hostage. Skillfully directed by Alan Gibson with a good sense of balanced narrative motion, the film provides freshness in almost every scene, as the criminal Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection of parole has been particularly undeserved, creates an escape plan confused, after which his spontaneous nature comes to the surface as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood. Often bursting into music or dancing a few steps, the whimsical Steckert gradually gains the confidence and affection of his captive, and as the police approach to an inevitable confrontation, the arrested couple is seen as much alike in their responses to rejection , as discerned by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to help a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) who is in charge of the hunt for Steckert and his "prisoner." This is a captivating, noteworthy story, a fast-paced romance novel that benefits from a Harris Capital performance, Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black twists, along with Justin Henry as the rapturous guy with an appropriately capricious punctuation . Contributed by Wilfred Josephs, and high-level cinematography by Frank Watts, with all the footage filmed in a beautiful autumnal province of Ontario.
