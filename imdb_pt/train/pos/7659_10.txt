I just watched this movie, which made me very annoyed. I've also been to South Africa twice, by the time the film was set. <br /> <br /> It's certainly blunt, and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. The slow but steady increase in rhythm hardly allows for a pause, and certainly there are few moments of light. <br /> <br /> We'll never see Nigel Hawthorne again. He came upon a very distorted person, and I found myself disgusting him more each time he showed up. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments.
