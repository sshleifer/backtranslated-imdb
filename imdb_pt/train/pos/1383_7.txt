The original title means "The Birth of Dust". I must confess that I do not quite understand this title. The title in English is "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read another reviewer's comment: "The title in French is also suggestive:" prieuve, "or octopus, suggests that an individual has to deal with many pressures simultaneously." Thanks for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is girls' first sexual emotions, when it is unclear whether they are aimed at the same or the other sex. It's no different for boys. I think both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any mixing. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is water ballet. Sometimes the girls are upside down and nothing above the water, except for the feet and the lower legs, with which they wave and kick in the air. For people like me who had never seen these things before, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of a team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her she would like to see when Floriane is training. This seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary. Soon they will walk together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her, and then leaves with him for an hour, while Marie is waiting for her to return. I took it for granted that the couple slept with each other. But then we'll learn from the film that they do less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that few users will find elsewhere. There's a scene where Marie secretly steals Floriane's trash bag. In it, she finds an apple, especially food. And Marie goes to eat the rest. ??? There is a parallel scene in another film, "Kazetachi no gogo" (Hitoshi Yazaki) (Japan, 1980). This is about young adult women, and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals a bag of garbage from the beloved, and also finds an apple more or less food and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Floriane tells Marie that she would like to have her first orgasm. Marie says she can not do that. <br /> <br /> But later, Marie says she's really willing to do it. And she masturbates in Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a director could have made such a good psychological show or study? I would like to quote Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is played by Ad√®le Haenel, who performed as an autistic performer in "The Little Devils" by Christophe Ruggia (2002). ? a very underrated film.
