First of all, the only reason people keep complaining about this movie is because they do not support some parts of the true story being "altered." Well, guess what? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect performance either. Well enough talking. This is a very beautiful film. The sets are beautiful and taken from well known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half of the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and even the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice casting is top notch and most of the characters look like I imagined it would be. Samwise is a little too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks AMAZING. The film has a great score that fully supports the film. If you like good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) try this movie, keeping in mind that it was done 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> Also of special note: Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Sisterhood follows almost exactly the same line as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has often said how much he admired Bakshi's effort).
