Like the TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is actually predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth about what happened, THE BOOTH because - let's face it - the genre and the basic configuration). This is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It means, in essence, that filmmakers do not punk in the end the way they could have, say, an American version of that story. THE BOOTH moves inexorably towards its (lost) conclusion, but is so beautifully crafted on all levels that one can enjoy the ride the way one can cruise family along a well-traveled stretch of road (very scenic) . It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's scary tale, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. Worth a good long look.
