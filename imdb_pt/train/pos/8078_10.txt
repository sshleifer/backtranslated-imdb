Even though this was a box office disaster, it's my favorite movie. Gives a powerful family message. There's a lot of violence and there's a song with a lot of bikini girls. In comparison to other bollywood movies, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh portrays this in this movie. Do not read reviews by the critic, they are just ignorant. This movie has good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So if you want to see a more realistic action than the main Hoon Na (still good movie), this is the movie.
