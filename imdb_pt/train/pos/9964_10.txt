Just take it. The DVD is cheap and easy to find, the length is now standard and you've spent enough time without it. (When the home video started, there were at least three versions with missing parts ...) Everything you read is true. There is no way to defend it and not live without it. The color is exuberant and wonderful to see, and the production values ​​are very good for a childish epic Saturday afternoon. But there's no doubt ... all Santa Claus. Satan's angle is so dropping the STRANGE chin made the movie a success at the time and a cult favorite so the home video really began. How good / bad / strange / is this? I just saw the TRAILER as a kid, and I remembered IT for almost 30 years ... including Murray's voice over ... I told my older sister, and she called me a liar and I could not believe it was POSSIBLE TO ANY person do add to it things like Santa Claus asking for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before going out on Christmas Eve, kids wanting to capture him and make him his SLAVE ... and an international children's sweat shop. probably comes close to a lot of nightmares that kids had in the 60s. Like the others here, I watch the whole vacation season thing now. (My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But the old way you choose, the film is a demented masterpiece and a total need (along with Brianiac, by the way ...) It never ceases to make me laugh. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARKS. Parts of it may still make you cringe or just scare you (how many parents do you know go out for cocktails on Christmas Eve?) If you get bored, go downstairs and play the piano "DANG ..") Freaky, annoying, upsetting, funny , childish, strange..those, what more could you want?
