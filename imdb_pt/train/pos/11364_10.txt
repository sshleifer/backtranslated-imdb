Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept at this type of role, where he must portray a character whose morality is at first uncertain to the public. As is often the case with Sutherland's characters, we should ask "is he a villain [in this case a minor], or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, intelligently told, about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the former Soviet Union that hindered the efforts of extremely competent people. As Sutherland's character ironically remarks, "the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions." The "committee meeting" (between the characters of Rea and Sutherland) after perestroika is applied, with its revelations, has enormous emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who worked on this system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes portraying the victims' family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story. This is rarely a feature of a movie with this unhealthy subject, but it effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important film that deserved its showcase in the history of Canada.
