Fuck, I've seen this movie for at least 4 times and I still do not get bored watching. <br /> <br /> The visuals are so good and together with the music that is totally amazing and perfect The movie is amazing for me. <br /> <br /> The CGIs are very bad IMHO, but all the visual with black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just ... Just a perfect genius combination for such a movie. All the feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, though, the film had minor flaws, such as, for example. sometimes I thought the movie was a bit "slow" but I do not mean the scenic parts so I totally loved those. <br /> <br /> I also get distracted very often by the totally complex story, like when he's in the underground digicorps thing, where all his data is saved, and he has this conversation with the guy down there ... but this may also be just me: DE the end could have been shown in some way more emphasized, they should have made the real memory part a bit longer and "higher", but again, without all these flaws, the movie It would have been so good that I would have never stopped watching it several times. .
