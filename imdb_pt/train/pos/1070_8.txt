Jessica Alba's Max and Cindy's original Valerie Rae Miller shines in this atmospheric and action serial. Wonderfully politically incorrect. Quality varies a lot from episode to episode, but usually the pattern is high and when it is not, Jessica is always worth looking at. Valerie's urban African American is almost dragging Dark Angel into the sitcom territory.
