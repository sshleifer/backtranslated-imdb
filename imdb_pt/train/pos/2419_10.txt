In addition to Plans, Trains and Automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is John Candy's funniest movie. When he becomes hypnotized with the playing card (similar to the Manchurian candidate) and becomes an excited guy who does not know what he is saying, he makes two memorable quotes (both dealing with the male anatomy). The love scene involving grocery items has to be seen, can not be described. <br /> <br />
