I got the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks, it sure made my money worth it!. I could care less about the hotties, but the excitement only surprised me after a steady diet of Simpsons (Sorry Mr. Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend multiple views with some cool melodies, good friends and a couple of cold cuts!
