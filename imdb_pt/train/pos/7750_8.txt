Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as he would sing a song from him. Anarchy rules over a logical and common line of thought. The story behind this movie just goes any way that the wind blows. And this can really be refreshing to see if you are prepared and willing to do so. Viewers who claim there is nothing to keep the story lines together are correct. Who the hell is this Windman? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, busy place that happens and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures the foolishness, racism, bureaucracy, vices and violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is fun, funny and a bit shallow. Barman's film debut will not have as much impact as his debut in music. In this light, some may be disappointed. But again, "Worst case scenario" would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows.
