If The Man in the White Suit had been made in the United States, can not you see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis experiencing the size of Sidney Stratton of Alec Guinness? <br /> <br /> This is one of Alec's best Guinness films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the UK has ever produced. It so perfectly fits within the deadline of the new labor government and the society it was trying to build. It is incredible how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness This humble schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that will never need cleansing, which actually repels. all kinds of foreign matter the minute you touch the clothes. <br /> <br /> He's a persistent fuck and succeeds. Of course the implications were not really thought about what kind of impact clothing the clothing will have on society. In the end everyone is chasing him like a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It's the mark of a great comedy movie that a potentially serious situation like the one described in some of the serious movies I mentioned can be played for laughter. Poor Guinness's costume is not only white and stain-repellent, but shines like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> In addition to Guinness, the best performances are Cecil Parker as another pompous imbecile, Joan Greenwood as his daughter and mermaid. Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK. Thinking about it, Paramount borrowed this Ealing suit and handed it to John Travolta for the Saturday Night Fever?
