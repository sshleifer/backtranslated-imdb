Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I must admit to those who have not seen. You will really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were disappointed simply because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is incredible! The sets, makeup, music, costumes and stunning acting make this movie fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - this is something rare these days. Directed, produced, and starring Warren Beatty as the crime fighter against the evil Big Boy Caprice of Al Pacino and his mob of bad guys. Madonna steals the show as the alluring Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best liners I've ever heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the cool things in the movie is that they used only seven colors to look like a comic book. This film really is a work of art that is sadly neglected by the public. To summarize things, this movie brings the child in all of us. It's a movie that will leave you smiling in the end.
