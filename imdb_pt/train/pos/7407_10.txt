This movie caught me by surprise. I watched it two or three times. I really liked this movie. There were many truths that this movie brought. I love all the characters in this movie too. This film makes a lot of sense because, as society "gets more advanced," what culture loses? Not to sound preacher. I can really relate to this movie of my son and lose part of my life that will never come back or never was the same. This movie is in my top 5 movies that I've watched. There is only one truth so crude that I feel when I watch the movie and it is not the kind of truth that you have to dig right in front of your face. The creators of this movie did a great job and I really enjoyed this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you'll love it.
