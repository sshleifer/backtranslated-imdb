Ang Lee clearly likes to get into a movie, pick up action, characters and ride the hull when they come up. Covering the random end of the American Civil War through the random actions of a young militia with no mind shape or masculinity, this is an ideal approach. The film turns out to be about personality formation, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful mid-south panoramas as a silent character, enduring the feud as a strong father. <br /> <br /> The script by James Schamus is probably the standard bearer of this film; Just behind, there are a series of well-equipped performances that take you admirably. The name of Jeffrey Wright alone could take this movie to me. He is brilliant here, but in a slow burning role: instead, we are led to very good (if not revealing) performances of a large, often recognizable ensemble. <br /> <br /> A noble and optimistic film. One to watch if you do not like Hard Mountain, more bittersweet, cooler or The Claim, for example. 7/10
