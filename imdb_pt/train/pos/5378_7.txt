This is an interesting little movie made in 1967 with a jazz soundtrack and a storyline that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun. I've seen many similarities between this and 'Blue Hand Creature' (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! The best of Scotland Yard is to investigate the murders of girls in a college. It seems that criminals are being released from a local jail to make the offer of some bad person and then return when their work is done. There is a neat gadget hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid, and there is another device that is neither sleek nor clandestine, looks like a large water pistol, and the victim should be close enough to get soaked before it expires. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mainly chews chewing gum and looks into the distance. There is a "monk," and as someone identifies this as a "monk" is beyond me, carries a whip and wears a red outfit with a red hood, plus a Klan member of a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of cool gadgets, like a fireplace that goes up and down to receive the monk, and passes straight through the fire without lighting the robe, a nice trick right there. This is a strange combination of crime drama with cheerful tones, and although it's a bit silly sometimes it's fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
