How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and affirmative of life. It ends with a brutal ending that you knew had to happen, even if you were waiting - maybe even believing - it would not. <br /> <br /> Practically, this is the biggest strength of the movie: it cleverly plays with your emotions and expectations, then drops a bomb on you. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a film theory class at USC in the mid-1990s. It's not easy to find, but it's definitely worth looking for.
