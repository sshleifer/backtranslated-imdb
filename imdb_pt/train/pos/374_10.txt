Rating "10/10" Master piece <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I do not think anything is perfect, but this film - along with Schindler's list - is his best. Even Oprah acts well in that! <br /> <br /> What struck me most was the realism of history and drama. Such things have happened and are still happening in the world.
