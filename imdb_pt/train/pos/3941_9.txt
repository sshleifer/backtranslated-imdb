Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film director / star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember years ago saying that when I was a young actor, he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and afraid he would not meet the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford before the shooting began to make him comfortable saying he would not play the Great Emancipator but only a jack-leg prairie lawyer. So Fonda led a cast that John Ford directed in a classic movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a Lincoln biographical film. This happened before in the era of sound with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey made the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But, as Ford said, Fonda was not playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of the early life of Lincoln. We see him working in a general store, acquiring some law books from a family of immigrant pioneers whose path he would cross again later in history. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with his early death, leaving Lincoln a very melancholy being. <br /> <br /> Fast forward about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who starts getting noticed. He served some terms in the legislature, but he is back in private practice and not sure if the policy is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action happens. The two children of the family he took the law books from when they are accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder, but one of a deputy sheriff. Judgment itself is fiction, but the play used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played the two children, is based on a real case that Lincoln defended. I will say no more. <br /> <br /> In addition to performances, Young Lincoln's great strength is the way John Ford captures the climate, atmosphere, and setting of a small prairie town in a quarter-century. Celebration of July. It's almost like you're watching a newscast. And it was the climate of the country itself, young, vibrant and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford's films will recognize two musical themes here that have been repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude in the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge, the song in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And in a dance, the song Lovely Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver that plays Mary Todd is the same as Fonda danced with Cathy Downs in My Darling Clementine at the prom for the creation of a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I believe. The first is that it is the living incarnation of our own American mythology about people who go from the bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. In fact, the young Mr. Lincoln graphically shows the background from which Lincoln came. And secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War, albeit for some necessary political reasons. His murder secured its place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others, I also mentioned special compliments to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two louts of the city, Kohler being the victim of the murder and Call the main accuser. Also Donald Meek as the prosecution lawyer and Alice Brady in what turned out to be his last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very good performance from Spencer Charters, who specializes in rustic characters as a judge. <br /> <br /> For a film that captures the drama and romance of the day, you can not do anything better than the young Mr. Lincoln.
