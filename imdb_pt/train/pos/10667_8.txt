I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I watched the movie as if it were not related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies, so I have developed a very early philosophy. Suppose the movie will be based on the book (or musical in this case), but although the plot may be similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so watch it as it is. <BR> I danced for 12 years before having to make a choice. I was a good dancer (picking up choir work in local productions as a kid etc), but I was not super talented. I was however super talented as a show rider. I was told by my dance instructor and my trainer (who spent several months a year on his farm out of state) that I had to make a choice when I turned 14. I needed to change my dancing two hours and four and five. days a week and walk 3 hours a day, 7 days a week .. and devote to one or the other. So, I love dancing and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance movies. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it's a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work too hard to get something you want and you just do not understand. I love the movie I love the Broadway musical.
