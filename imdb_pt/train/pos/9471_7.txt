Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, the newspaper's agony uncle and single dad dedicated to three girls. Upon returning home to a large family, Dan finds his perfect wife, only to discover that she is in a relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What man has to do? <br /> <br /> I quite liked "Dan In Real Life," but I imagine the success or otherwise of this movie will depend on whether you are willing to accept Steve Carter playing a relatively straightforward and restrained role, rather than going through by the broad movements of comedy that have made him so successful. If you can not accept, do not be afraid, "Get Smart" will be at the end of the year, but for the record I thought it was very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" begins as your typical, rather fun, family drama, but it gets funnier and fun as it grows and Carell's frustration with her situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original insights, the cinematographic captures would actually be very meager, would not they?), But "Dan In Real Life" is fun, and a good cast (who would not fall for love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?), make the most of an insightful script that contains many thoughts about the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell will push and do something so interesting again.
