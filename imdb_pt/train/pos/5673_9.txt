I think 'Blackadder the Third' is the best of the series. Actuelly all the episodes are funny, personally I really like the episode with the 'French invasion', but the one with the superstitious actors in 'MACBETH' is also very funny, the way Rowan keeps playing is actually (English) Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: 'Do not ever say that again, always call them Scots. Touch; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ... <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have most of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series especially good. <br /> I hope Rowan continues his great style, but I think we can count on him, because he is already working on a Bean 2 movie, which will be released this year, I can not wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this 3rd Blackadder a grade 9 out of 10.
