Again, I was browsing through the discounted video box and got this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time the movies I find in the trash are sheer crap (I mean horrible beyond belief), but in the middle of the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is so much better than I expected. I found it very interesting, but obviously it was made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good emotions. I hoped it was more of a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly humorous. There is no bloody violence, no swearing, no nudity, no sex. Usually, these films require all four of these elements. The PG rating is well-deserved - not like "Sixteen Candles," where the word "f" is used twice and there is a brief scene of free nudity. <br /> <br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could have been further developed. The film tends to be heavy and the potentially good subframes are pushed aside. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two, we ended up watching a careless three-minute assembly of them in their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing in the end, but there is such a small chemistry that it seems forced. <br /> <br /> "The Dream Machine" is no jewel, but it's good and clean entertainment. It's quite forgettable - especially with a cast of strangers, except for Haim - but it's also much better than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
