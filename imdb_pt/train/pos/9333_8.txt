Having lived in Ontario all my life, in the same town where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories of her from my parents, grandparents, and family members. So when I found out they were filming a movie about her, and the beginning would be filmed on my street, and her house right next to mine, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock to Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore, you have a very different image of her as a person, she was considered strangely beautiful by people who actually had a chance to meet her , except for her own family who frequently abused her as a child, with the exception of one of her siblings. Also, if you live in my area and are smart enough to listen to those who knew you from school, you would find that she was really hurt before she even entered an institution, she was always defensive and what would seem like a lack of willingness to learn in a school setting was really embarrassing about the fact that she was unable to. Marlene did not deserve the life she was given, with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. It was the government and the people around her who helped her over her death by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I still feel irritated that she was arrested for self-defense by a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with her, so they locked her up and killed her." I believe it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve so much.
