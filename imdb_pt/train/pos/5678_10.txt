We can still use Black Adder to this day. Imagine Rowan Atkinson retaking the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as the imbecile Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode that Kenneth Connor stars as a British actor. Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two authors make a small silly act to ward off evil spirits. It's the funniest thing you'll ever see. Of course, none of this brilliance and comic genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and fun, all at once. I was hoping last night on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie would pay tribute to his British mood story. If the SNL class did some research, I would know it was treasure to have Hugh Laurie decorating his stage.
