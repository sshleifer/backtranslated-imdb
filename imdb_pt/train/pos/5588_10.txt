The first time I had the opportunity to see this almost forgotten classic was in the early 80's in one of our art houses as a renaissance. As I watched this feverish dream of a 1930s sexuality exercise, I thought of YOWZA! They fled with murder in Europe in the past. Unfortunately, this film was heavily outlined at its original US release by the blue-nosed Hayes Office (the government's firm censorship body, started by the "holier than you" Bible scout, Will Hayes ... Post Office, if you can believe that), because of its general theme of human sexuality (Heaven's prohibit humans actually had sex in the 1930s). The plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man and then repents. She (Lamarr) meets a younger, handsome man and has an affair with him, resulting in a divorce from her previous husband (another not, not in Hollywood movies at that time --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time the director worked on the sound format (ie, the film seems to have techniques that were mostly used in silent films - ie, expressionism in 1920). It is still worth looking for a window for the first European films spoken, along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930), and "Vampyre" by Karl Gustav Dryer (1931). Unclassified but contains that infamous naked scene of swimming and some veiled sexual references, which would cost little more than a PG-13 by today's standards (but would have easily gotten the dreaded 'X' in the 1930s if it existed then)
