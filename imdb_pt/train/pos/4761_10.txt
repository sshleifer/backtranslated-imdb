An excellent film with great performances by Zack & Lochley. Much to his displeasure (& my) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With all respect to Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It does not take long to start criticizing Zack (whom I love most of everyone on the show) and take over. I'm sure Zack could have dealt with it. The plot of Soulhunter is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack. Humor complements very well. 10/10
