All Dogs Go To Heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated film of all time. I'm not really a big fan of animated films, but there's something about it that makes it better than any other animated movie I've ever seen. The music is wonderful, as are the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and especially Ken Page as the Alligator King. "Let's Make Music Together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any music film I've ever seen. This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
