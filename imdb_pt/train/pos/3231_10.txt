Soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hates it has many good reasons. But I really liked the Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, the art direction is firm and well executed. As far as science fiction scenarios were concerned, the Soldier was doing things with more design than 90% of the genre. Scenarios, costumes and accessories were all consistent and executed competently; I did not love all of his future military style, but I was impressed by the effort. For me, that made the movie worth the time it took to watch. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his films by John Carpenter. The soldier is essentially an action movie, and Sergeant Todd's role is an essential action hero. It's not an award-winning role, but Kurt can convince the emotion with VERY little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This is not an iron monkey, or even the matrix, but again, far exceeds the average level of quality of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, and like science fiction action movies, pick it up if you pass on your rental deposit of choice. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
