The movie is fine, there are moments, the musical scenes are the best of them all! The soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (appropriate for the beginning, since it's a great party music and lots of up-tempo), Take Me With U (a fun pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (which is probably the closest thing to R & B throughout this album), Computer Blue (a somewhat angry hymn to Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, very vaguely makes fun of Appolonia), When Doves Cry (the climax to this masterpiece), I would die 4 U, Baby, I am a star and of course, Purple Rain (a true classic, a very appropriate end to this classic album) Film and album are both very good. I highly recommend them!
