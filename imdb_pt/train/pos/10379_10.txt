Plato's film is a fun movie with Gary Busey. He's a rather unknown film, so I saw him in a car boot. I thought that would be fun. Gary Busey plays Plato with a tough mercenary who is framed by the murder. of a powerful now-fleeing Cuban crime lord, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what I liked about Plato's run was how the movie never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was a lot of fun as well especially the climax Gary Busey does a good ironic hero since he usually plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's helper even Jeff Speaksman does a good performance and he can not even act well to finish Plato's career is a nice effort of films and I give 7 out of 10
