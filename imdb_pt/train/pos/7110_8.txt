John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting in Guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical notions about blindness and is sure to be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and their injured Marines are unable to reach him. Not even your girl can go home played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self pity and prejudice. It is a complex role that Garfield carries in a memorable way in a great performance that keeps an observation despite the always present melodrama melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal where he is in a machine gun nest trying to fend off Japanese soldiers in an infernal battle at night, and later a string of dreams at the hospital where he finds himself walking on a train platform with a white cane, sunglasses and holding a cup of tin while the girlfriend moves away from the camera.
