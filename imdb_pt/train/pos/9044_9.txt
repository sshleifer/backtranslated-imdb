I recently saw this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I figured I'd watch the movies I lost. I had no expectations of getting into the movie, so I was surprised to have missed this movie. It's an exciting father and son tale, and it's also an underdog story. I even shed a tear at the end of this wonderful tale. This movie appeals to all ages. The only reason I give 9 of 10 is that it slows down a bit in the middle, but comes back strong in the end. The acting was great, the story was magnificent and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film. WATCH THIS MOVIE! Rent, buy, watch, LOVE! I know I did!
