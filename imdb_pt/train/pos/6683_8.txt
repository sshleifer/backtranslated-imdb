Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door and have fun with this maniacally funny, totally absurd, ultra-campy live-action cartoon. MYSTERY MEN is a sequel to all the superhero movies you have ever seen, but their unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied and well-released that they are memorable characters by themselves. Black humor, sheer nonsense, good faith, and even one or two touching moments combine to make this comical fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors who play The Mysterious Men - including a Mysterious Woman - are a perfect contrast to Wes Studi's, as what can only be described as a bargain-type Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the - Wall (and strangely charming) villains always walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and on the big screen. Prepare to laugh, clap and say "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
