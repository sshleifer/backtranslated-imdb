We're talking about a low-budget movie, and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: a sudden explosives expert and a senseless alcoholic); but in general, the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are nice and there are some unique situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise you with some people who are not who they want you to believe in and then twist and turn the plot ... I applaud this on this. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see also "Nine Queens" an Argentine film.
