Perhaps the last film you expect comes from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neo-realist fantasy, a kind of oxymoron, in fact. An old woman finds a baby on her bed of cabbage and rears it as her own child. After a few years, the baby is a boy (named Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He goes to an orphanage and when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately he discovers he has no home. Toto is optimistic, however, and will not let anything knock him out. A man steals his valise and instead of being angry, Toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small favela. Toto takes some initiative and organizes the many street dwellers who live in the area and build a better favela. Soon, the owner is trying to sell that land and the citizens of the favela need to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner assembles a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a complete fantasy (before that it was a more comical / fantastic melodrama in Charlie Chaplin's style). This thing is so strange and shocking that it is probably best that others see it for themselves. It's incredible and very funny. There are objections you could raise about the plot of Miracle in Milan, certainly. Fellini and Visconti were much criticized when they began to deviate from neorealism. I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, though, it's so enjoyable - I loved it a lot. It may be my favorite of the Vittorio de Sica movies, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves get very close. 10/10.
