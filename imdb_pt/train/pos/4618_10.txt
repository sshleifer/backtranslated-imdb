I really liked this movie. I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could relate. This will be a movie I would show my children to let them know, the feelings they are having are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so devastated by things at such a young age..that I knew we would recover .... again and again .... Great movie !!!!
