The weather was not nice with this movie. Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, now this movie looks like a simple mainstream version of its typical spookfest. Horrifying touches aside (particularly that crazy, over the end), this is essentially a brilliant horror film for those people who do not care much about the genre. He has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast to convince the public that this was true. not his average lowbrow movie (producers of 1970s disaster films had a similar idea). I liked seeing the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter how high class the movie pretends to be, it operates at the level of its 1970s middle-exploitation movie (not a bad thing at all. however). Still, it's a nice movie, especially for viewers who like to watch the stars. As usual, Albert Whitlock's work mate is excellent. Overall, quite fun.
