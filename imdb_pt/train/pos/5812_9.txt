Moonwalker is probably not the movie to watch if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson. I'm a big fan and enjoyed most of the movie, the ending was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were - if you are a fan. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over. The dance in each video is breathtaking, the music is fantastic to hear and the dialogue is fun. <br /> <br /> Includes many of his best Bad videos and excerpts from his previous videos. It also includes some scenes from live shows. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson, it is a must, if you are not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, be clear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
