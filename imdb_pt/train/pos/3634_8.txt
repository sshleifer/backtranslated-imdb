I had low expectations for this movie but was looking for something uncontested for one night. I left the theater totally enchanted and somewhat surprised. This is a very good baseball tribute movie and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a few hours of your time!
