Having the opportunity to watch some of the footage in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I could not wait to see the final copy. Seeing this movie at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I did not laugh out loud in a comedy in a long time! It's a great slap. The Russian brothers did a good job of steering. The entire cast performs its best comedic acting ... There are no slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he is great as the crippled safe circuit breaker in this movie. I was more snubby by William H. Macy as the villain "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" they keep you in "spots". I believe they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
