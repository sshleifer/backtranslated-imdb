This movie may look dated today, but remember it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin was going beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and entering the heavy satirical mood. This movie is the grandfather of them all. Appreciate it for its historical significance as well as for its strong entertainment value.
