In this truly fascinating and somber film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil takes his mirror image (this is done brilliantly in the film and strangely foreboded when Balduin, the student is earlier practicing fencing in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man at war with himself," which foreshadows his immediate future. The student likes his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he made a pact with the devil, he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money, you can not have both. Balduin is haunted by his double (the intertitles express this wonderfully as the action.) Some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of destruction when the Devil disappears with the mirrored image of Balduin is incredible, as is the feeling that his covenant cut him off always outside human society (the scene where he flees from his double and ends up in the "desert" on the outskirts of the city, is no longer entirely human (he has lost his soul) he is like an animal hunted out of human society There are so many Other things to say about this incredible film: Paul Wegener was an incredible actor and director, a cultural hero of mine, which helps if you know a little of German history at the time this film was made and about the German doppelganger. Just remember, it's a very old movie, sometimes a bit clumsy, but considering what it has to say and its tragic ending, it's one of the best of t all times (yes!)
