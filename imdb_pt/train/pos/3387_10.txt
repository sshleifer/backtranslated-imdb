Truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is scary. An overpopulated world, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources. In this degenerate nightmarish society, we have the great Charlton Heston as a nice Noirish detective of the film trying to understand the truth behind a murder, in line with the noir film legend, Edward G Robinson, making a great past performance. <br /> <br /> One of the images that will always remain with me in this film is the masses of people who populate the stairwells and the way Thorne (Heston) has to go through them every time he uses them. <br /> <br /> The use of music in the film is also noteworthy, although it does not contain score in the usual sense. The opening theme is good, and the subsequent pieces of music that we here in Simonson's apartment and especially Beethoven's plays at the euthanasia clinic are exceptional. atmospheric.
