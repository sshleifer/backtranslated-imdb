One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravery on the Lower East Side of New York, with both leaderships being superstars in formation. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing version of urban youth that puts Larry Clark's Naicote chill in the gutter where he belongs ... though I have to admit that Bully was above his normal fare. Levant Victor Vargas is a movie that you will kick for having lost ... so do not miss out!
