No, there is another! <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion on I, II and III and because that opinion was biased, since we lost both the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy. , I will expose the positive points of "The Return of the Jedi" and some corresponding negative points of the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere. What we have in the original trilogy and in this particular film: - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating perspectives on the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A scene Killer: Near the end, when Vader looks alternately at his son and at the Emperor. The lightning bolt of lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke, risking his own life! Oh, boy! <br /> <br /> What is wrong with the prequel INMHO: - the whole element "human factor" that the original cast was able to move forward is somehow absent - The Force seems to be more about super powers and somersaults, than on wisdom - Many Jedi at a time and many Light Sabers onscreen - The lack of experience of some actors often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /> <br /> By the way, if you appreciate the theory of the Force, as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read some books on Buddhism and the forms it took in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuous spiritual inheritance of a master for his apprentice, from a father to his son, although the difficulties. "De monâme à ton âme" (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
