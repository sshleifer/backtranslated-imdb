I always liked this video cover movie. Eventually got to buy it for a fair share on a sale and boy that a movie. A simply stunning performance of the whole case and is filmed in a very beautiful way. Even at times in the distance, you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you are actually some distance away picking up bits of history. It's really exciting, often fun and very watchable. There is not much dialogue but it is filmed in such a way that you feel very much around everything. A 9/10 of me. A must see.
