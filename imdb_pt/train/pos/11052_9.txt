When I was six, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones," and even though I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents to let me watch "The Champions" and "The Avengers" once per week . I think it was the Golden Age of the English series ... (I already own the complete cycle of "The Prisoner"!) But I also lingered a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch", or is it "Harry Potter" on the girl, of course, before As much as I want "The Campions" to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for "Dr. Who" (pack the whole series into a set of, uhm, maybe 300 DVD's, please, I could not spend more for it, 8), "People of Tomorrow", and several other "low budget" but great stories to be available within my hit areas. I speak and understand English, but not all my relatives, including my parents, introduced me to these great stories ... I hope someday someone can feel the attraction of these series and then sell them as I originally saw them. Dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format I saw them, remember, zone 1 or 4 are OK with my TV set!
