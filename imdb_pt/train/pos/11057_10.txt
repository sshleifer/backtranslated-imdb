I was 10 when this show was on TV. By far, it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was simply beautiful ... I only ask for the DVD (15 episodes). They did not have superpowers. They only had superior human abilities (strength, hearing, vision). The 3 actors were very good at their reels, very believable. There was a good story in each episode. At the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script should be good, and the characters played were great. There were no extravagant things, like at other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to do a lights show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good things.
