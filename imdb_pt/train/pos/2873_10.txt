This is one of the top five Disney animated features in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the animated feature film (unlike the compilation films of the 1940s), and an expensive depth through the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. While Disney adapts the story a bit liberally, you bring the idea of ​​the season through the dress and define styling - a clear time frame in which the story takes place. <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters are a bit well-developed, except for Prince - left the flatter - we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has some lasting impact on the history of popular culture - in most versions of Cinderella, sisters are attractive, not as pretty as Cinderella, and their character takes off their pleasing appearance. > Favorite additions from Disney: the rats! Also, I enjoyed the continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade dress, as well as the following sisters' attack, was always horrible as a child - I remember seeing the Master showing it with a black background and a great red light on it! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of the evil Lady Tremaine to give up her influence on Cinderella and admit defeat - Audley would characterize the most perverse of all Disney villains, the evil Satanic witch in Sleeping Beauty.
