This movie is absolutely stunning. A new Blade Runner - noir future no gritty. The vision of Paris is superb, both recognizable and visionary, with sweeping views, dirty scenery and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the movie. It's a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and rendered in black and white (without ashes!) with only a small spot of color, it is less hard on the eyes than it looks. There are lots of arty camera shots - close-ups and weird points of view - but this only increases the film's temperament. Overall, you get the impression of a graphic novel in film form. <br /> <br /> Initially, I got the impression that the movie had been rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. But unlike "The Darkly Scanner" - which suffers from (or is reinforced by) inconsistent character definition (just note how some of the hair changes shape!) - The Renaissance is consistent and accurate throughout the process. When the character is in close-up, additional details and texture can be seen, but when half-shot or more details are omitted, but not to the detriment of the character's definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only disadvantage of the film is that in a comment we are told that this is a unique project. It's a shame because I would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir story and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English dub is great too. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie and highly recommended.
