Four great stories by master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early 70's, are the basis of this excellent Amicus production. This was a very popular type of film in the sixties until the mid-seventies and is one of my favorite types of horror movies. This in particular shines for the episode Sweets to the Sweet, where Christopher Lee is chased by his evil daughter, heiress of his maternal tradition. Great fun from start to finish, and good to very good are also the other three episodes (with the latter a little on the comic side, but with the great addition of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire in English cinema.
