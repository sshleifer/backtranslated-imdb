Usually I do not like series. They are all predictable and tend to become boring and boring very fast. <br /> <br /> These series, however, are well played, the story follows all the episodes and even if you miss one, the story is still capturing your mind. <br /> <br /> The episodes are all filmed in a hospital and take you more and more to the mysteries of the dark and ancient secrets that lie just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital.
