This is a great modern movie noir .... "excellent" in that it is interesting from start to finish. There are some holes here and some silly parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I have not met anyone who has not gotten caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, twists and interesting characters. In addition, it boasts beautiful colors and cinematography, plus a good soundtrack based on guitar. <br /> <br /> I've labeled this crime film "film noir" because it's bleak and the characters are not good. Even the only supposedly good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets into trouble by lying and has a quick case he should not have. He also does something in the end that is not right, but I will not ruin it by saying. Suffice it to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys," does someone do better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the "insane" category, it's hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for several reasons. J.T. Walsh also gives another excellent supporting performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that never received much publicity, but it should have been. You'll have fun watching it. By the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without ruining everything!
