This is a awesome classic 1950's monster movie! I love the look of the 1950s in general, like cars and music. Anyway, I love the way the bubble looks. I love it when everyone is in the theater horror movie and the bubble comes in and locks up the party. Another thing I love is that everything happens on a night, like on Halloween II. When Steve and Jane are kissing, they watch a meteor fall from space. Inside the meteor is the bubble. Whenever the blob consumes a person, it gets bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the city about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. Can anything stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend the BLOB !!!
