Unfortunately, this movie never came to DVD. I saw it when it was released in theaters in 1983 and again when the VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not dissapointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to see. But then the movie takes you to an unreal world, where you have to reflect on your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The movie is about many things. It's about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into debt that they can never pay. It's about how our economic system exploits us, forcing us into debt with credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It's about trying to save an innocence that we may never have had, and maybe we can not really save. It is about good and evil and about how difficult it is sometimes to distinguish one from the other. This raises many questions but does not provide answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason, this is a movie that is really worth saving and watching.
