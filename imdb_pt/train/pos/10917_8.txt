I just managed to get DVD 3 from the Celestial region of the Five Poisons and what a super job they made of it. A fantastic digitally remastered and indispensable transfer for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is quite straightforward, and has already been mentioned, so I will not go into it again. Needless to say, they are the fight scenes that many buy the movie, and they do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit few and far between and seem more rehearsed. Bruce Lee could enjoy all this and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with the important "writer type" clicks and air "whooshes" which is a cool effect though quite fun! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a B +. Good, but not great. In a way I feel it could have been a little better. Golden Swallow, the same director a decade earlier, had such a good story and best action.
