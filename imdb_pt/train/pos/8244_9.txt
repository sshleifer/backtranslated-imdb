Loved it! What's not to like? - you have your suburbs, you have your zombies, you have your family problems, you have your social dilemmas, you have a retro retro style of the 1950s eating meat under class at bay for a restless worried about if they are the next meal upper crust. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a social climbing debutress housewife. She is both debauched and criminally conspiratorial. Every K'sun guy's dream is really great as the son who is trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding. It is a genuine screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious cop with sharp instincts and little sensitivity as if he were his everyday person. Billy Connolly is delicious as Fido. A great actor: I wish he had played the lead role in "Braveheart," directed by Gibson. My feeling is that your William Wallace would be closer to the real character. His Fido is restrained but accessible. A nice touch. In short, a great and wonderful satirical test of morality, values, social limitations, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times and compensatory adjustments for impossible conditions. A real reality show.
