An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern goes a long way to researching and documenting his writing and makes up for it. He is not afraid to tell the truth even though he may draw unfavorable criticism and comments from some who like stories to be clean, sweet and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings Christopher Eccleston, though not in as high a role as played in Hillsborough. I found this film as accurate, well-represented and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his poignant writing with no remorse. Well done and my hat is for the writer, the actors, the production team. A great movie!
