This cool game of Marvel superheroes pays tribute, while remaining true to comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so weak with weak graphics and gameplay, Spider-Man improves in both departments. He also presents the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man comic books. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, Spider-Man does what a spider can do. He does more than weave webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he is not using web in combat, he punches and kicks too. Spidey has his hands full as he battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America at one end. <br /> <br /> Most levels are challenging, but some require patience to win. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true fan of Marvel superheroes, this game is for you, but do not expect a long game. Best of luck in "Spider-Man 2". My rating: 9 out of 10.
