A man resets himself to life alone after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the problem of the dairy cow of the family, Tulip, which refuses to allow to be milked. Even, that is, he visualizes his wife, who was the one who used to milk the tulip. <br /> <br /> Tulipa is based on a true story told in the Griffith family, in the generation of their grandparents. The film is a nostalgic retrospective of a vanishing way of life, where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other, set in the lush Victorian green field (the Australian state, not the time). Writer and director Griffiths evidently has more ambitions in both areas, and this award-winning multiple of 15-minute short is a good start for his reel.
