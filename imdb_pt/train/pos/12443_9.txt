I liked this movie. It was a joy to see such a close version of Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> Several people did not like the movie, but this should be seen in the context of the origin's story. The film uses flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that made her the woman she became. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow, and to my taste not enough tension is developed in the current scenes. However, this is acceptable only to get such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll have fun even with your flaws, if you just want an action movie with car chases - forget it. <br /> <br /> It feels like being the first of a franchise, but as I've never seen it promote anywhere, I suspect there will be nothing left to follow. Unfortunately.
