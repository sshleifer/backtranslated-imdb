Successful married businessman Harry Mitchell (a superb performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulterous affair with hot stripper Cini (the beautiful Kelly Preston). Harry is blackmailed by a trio of low-quality hoods - Raimy (a splendid and viscous John Glover), Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and Bobby Shy (Clarence Williams III). ) - who recorded his case with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cini and make it appear that Harry did it. This, in turn, ignites a dangerous battle of wit and determination between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, adopting a difficult script based on Elmore Leonard's thriller novel, skilfully maintains a fast and steady pace, provides plenty of tension, and creates an irresistible accent atmosphere. The protagonists are all uniformly excellent, with victorious support from Ann-Margret as the bitter and neglected wife of Harry, Barbara, Vanity as the daring prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. The tight'wisty plot keeps viewers on their toes all over. The perverse and profane dialogue, Jost Vacano's brilliant cinematography, Gary Chang's soundtrack, the harshly amoral tone and the exciting conclusion are also in the money. As an added bonus, Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A very small and very satisfactory number that is worth checking out.
