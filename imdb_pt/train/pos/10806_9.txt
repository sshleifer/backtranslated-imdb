I felt this movie - everywhere. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's ability to develop his relationship with Lillie, a typically Australian mix of soft, somewhat derogatory, and very persistent approach. Really loved the cinematography and direction. Pace was right and the portraits of almost every character were impressive. <br /> <br /> My God, Russell's talent, even in 1993, did not shine! .. and I still have to see Gladiator.
