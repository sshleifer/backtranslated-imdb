THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a "mainstream" movie if he wanted to. In comparison to his other more artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of cunning and almost no esoteric element. <br /> <br /> The exception is, of course, the final scene in the hall of mirrors, widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in film history. Only worth the cost of a rental. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the superb performance of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her acting during the beginning and middle of the movie is so great, she made the other actors appear as caricatures rather than characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
