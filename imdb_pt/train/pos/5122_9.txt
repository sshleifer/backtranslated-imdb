# 3 in the young John Travolta's blockbusters trilogy. He dances for disco, rock 'n' roll and country. He goes to Houston to find work and love. Gilley's the hot spot, and it's time for the mechanical bull. Not to be outdone, I rode the bull at a club in Nashville. I recently saw this movie almost forgotten on television and I remembered how good it was and how good it was in 1980. I wore a black cowboy hat that year as well as Travolta. Debra Winger was at its peak. She looks impressive in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem like the ideal couple, even if they're trailer trash. They split up just because it's so good to get back together. Urban Cowboy has an incredible soundtrack. We hear Lyin 'Eyes from The Eagles and Johnny Lee' s Lookin 'For Love.
