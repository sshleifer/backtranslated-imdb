A patchwork of 911. The 11 stories of 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first, for example), sometimes used to tell Americans "we've had more deaths than you and you supported the killers, "sometimes very strange (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (personal life of a couple in New York, showing that our day-to-day "problems" are not important), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-war in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo , typical African optimism despite the terrible misery of everyday life), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, with moral difficulties to accept US policy towards the Arab countries) I am very pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie. This shows that we (or they are still Belgians, but have lived in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures, and we are able to question the past and present actions of our government, as we should in a democracy.
