I really do not know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It is not preaching, it is not anchored by its morals, it should not be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God does not care about religion. And it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job at an anchor job. This unit is what is slowly taking its beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the final straws are run, he is quick not to laugh but screams in God's face, which in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself until he is guilty of helping others where he continues to lose the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement over his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> OK, that was kind of long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step way in which we face the challenges of being God is far better than putting your problems together, and is capable of hiding reasonably well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know by hearing about this movie in the first place, Carrey's perfect acting remains in the character (which fortunately is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene the scene. Whether they admitted it or not, the paper was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without it, the humor would be boring, since humor is half the execution. And the mood is very good at first. But without Carrey, it would be kind of like an aspiring It's a Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what anyone might say, does not act as the only excuse for the third act. At least you do not think so when you see it. She gives a sincere performance and makes you forget that you are watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The movie looks very good (see the movie to understand), has a good feeling, addresses the idea properly and better than expected and in general should never have been called slapped together only to save Carrey's career (which was not going anywhere.).
