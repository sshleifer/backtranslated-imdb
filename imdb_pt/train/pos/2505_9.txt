Many people judge this as a fan-service movie because many super star starring in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom is a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge before you watch, that's what I say. Gackt and staff are very serious when they made this movie, and they worked very hard. It's a good movie with a delicate story inside. Several scenes can be so much fun and others so sad. They did it so well until I can not stop watching it all over again. <br /> <br /> The story has been written very well, but I admit that their act is a little disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his ability to act is underestimated and it is strange to hear the way he speaks with another language except his native language (Japan). But, it's understandable because this is their first time to play in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how one can be so weak when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire like him because he did not let her die, when Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son died, and the best and most beautiful scene is when Sho passes ~ even I said that Hyde's ability is still strange, but I give him two hits in that scene !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes too fast as if they did not tell the reason Why the son can join the local mafia and be Sho's enemy because they are a good friend in the past and also are is Sho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I love this movie ~ (very ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a beautiful moving story.
