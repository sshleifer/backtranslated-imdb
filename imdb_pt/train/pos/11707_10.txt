I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, although it had no special effect, the acting was very good. And it still has the same message for today, even if the technology has changed, maybe they should do a remake of that movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music of the movie too, Larry Norman was a very good songwriter during that time period, although now most of Christian music is now worship and praise. I was always curious to know what happened to Patty after the series ended? She made more movies, she eventually got married and raised a family? I would like to have an update.
