OK, so the plays were poorly written and generally poorly sung (though Walken and Marner, particularly Walken, looked very good). And so they broke the fourth wall at the end, causing the king and his nobles to sing about the "battle" with the ogre and praise the efforts of the Bootleg when they should not know it by right. <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, making a movie based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style fits nicely with the dishonest and mischievous Puss who seems to take his master to ever deeper problems, but actually has a plan that he thinks about seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of your villain roles, you * know * the ogre bit the hard powder at the end when Walken put him in his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, and a must-have for anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher Walken.
