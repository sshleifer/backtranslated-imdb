I was dragged into this movie about four years ago by a French actress, my friend. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour, I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this movie, hating myself and even hating the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened, but I was pulled into the movie in a way that I had not done for years. And that was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to make each change by hand. I was at the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that great movies draw you into a world, make you part of it, and then leave you to talk to your friends, having coffee or a drink. This movie did it. It was one of the best shooting experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br />
