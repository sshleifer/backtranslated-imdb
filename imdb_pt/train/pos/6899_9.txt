The superb star quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this witty, witty and witty comedy, full of swordsmanship and antics. Charmingly loopy in his narrative, impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest. A movie one will remember with a lot of affection.
