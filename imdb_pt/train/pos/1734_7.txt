I just saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. Her dance was so much fun. I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery was great too. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laugh at the silly kissing scenes, but that's what's great about old movies! I grew up with her in The Munsters and I'm enjoying watching her in her previous films. They may not be all the best out there, but it's still worth watching to see her act and sing. I'm slowly buying all her movies and watching them while I get them. I have a great collection of your memorabilia.
