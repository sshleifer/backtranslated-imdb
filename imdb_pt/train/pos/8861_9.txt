Andy says, "Nobody gets hurt, everyone wins." Before he says, we know the opposite is true: everyone hurts, no one wins. This is a new strand in American movies, or maybe an old wire finally brought back. Think "Eastern Promises," "There Will Be Blood," "No Country for Old Men." These films are dark, serious, extremely well done, and do not care about happy endings. I adore them. "Before the devil knows that you are dead" fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere of its own. Kelly Masterson's debut screenplay is as close as a Hollywood movie ever to a Greek tragedy. Paying homage to veteran fellow director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet cleverly and soberly transforms the dark story into an extraordinary old-school character drama. The opening shots, though of an obese counter-style doggie his wife's trophy, have the painting appearance of a Dutch master. On the other hand, the condominium of drug traffickers looks more like a chain of Mondrians. Great performances around. Only Albert Finney's character, Charles, feels a bit overdone, his eyes wide and his mouth open almost all the time. But then he has deep problems, deeper than any of the problems that most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you do not need me to tell you that. Because your character Gina would like to be with a guy like Andy, they never tell us, but that's okay. The action is character, after all. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this great film a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
