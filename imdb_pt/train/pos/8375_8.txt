<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a great movie okay, some of the sets are bad and the acting is not so good, but the special effects are very good for a movie this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years old now and was made very cheap in the first place so you can not complain much about the bad parts. So, sit back and watch a cool movie with great robots on it.
