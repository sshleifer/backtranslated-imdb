I've never had a Nintendo 64, but I've played it many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I've played this game many times and it's good all the time. If you have an N64 and do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side scrolling games, but Super Mario 64 Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is kind of weird, but there are lots of things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and once again need to rescue the Princess and Bowzer's 120 power stars. Now you can do it in a 3D environment.Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
