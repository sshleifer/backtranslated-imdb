I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best artists in the world. I can not understand why some people say she is not. Boring....??? Maybe whoever said it is boring is because it is annoying. She is a great actress and the movie was great. There are many wonderful ideas and very good artists. The direction was great. I imagine myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and fragrance, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When she goes to her sister's store it is simply amazing. It's all good. We have a great actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a great job. <br /> <br /> Ana
