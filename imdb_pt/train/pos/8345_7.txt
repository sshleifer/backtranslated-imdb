I recently saw I.Q. and even though I'm not a type of romantic comedy, I think it was just a good, sweet movie to watch. So many movies, in my opinion, lack honesty. Do you know this feeling when you are watching a movie and feel stolen because you are getting something from the story and it was as if the director had thrown everything together as if it were garbage? The story among scientists is sweet and funny. How they kept together and tried to help the character of Tim Robbins to become intelligent. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems". I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
