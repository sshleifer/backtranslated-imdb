I watch movies for a living by choosing which ones are good enough to distribute ... Leaving aside those who do not cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone based on that, I'm just taking you to how I watched "The Gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies land on my desk and I really do sit through them all. I do not actually "watch" everything, normally I just watch TV from time to time while I'm working on checking the value of production, performance, and how well the story is being presented. If something catches my eye, I'll have time to watch. "Lou" attracted me during the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and took my chair to the TV, so I could tune in completely. Needless to say, I was fascinated throughout the film. The story is told well, the characters are captivating or repulsive (depending on the actor's direction and the director's intention for the character) and all very well played. Sometimes I've caught occasional amateur mistakes in camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes these flaws easy to ignore. I heard comments from other people saying that sometimes the movie brought tears to the eyes, again extreme euphoria ... I was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie. Unfortunately, I could not get it because I was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar less. That's how it happens sometimes ... but at least I've had the pleasure of seeing this and can not wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and good luck to you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are undoubtedly a talent to watch.
