John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best film I've seen for some time. It gives the viewer a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (I live in neighboring Washington, DC), with a use of Warhol's colors, exaggerated movements, and emotions. Pecker becomes bigger than his city can bear, and he is separated from his loved ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-lover art manager. The image left a refreshing taste in my mouth - like fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this taste was simple and simplistic, it only made everything deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to bear arms ... and everything else this country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
