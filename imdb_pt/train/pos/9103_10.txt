In life, we first organize stones (Stones in Spanish), such as career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small needs. If you do the reverse, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five protagonists of this film are women who have failed to organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, sets his first feature film, Stones, in this way. The film tells the parallel and conflicting trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972) and Maricarmen , 1954 -) Everyone is bent on removing stones that insistently appear on their way or, worse, that are in their shoes. There are five Cinderellas in search of the Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is Anita (Monica Cervera), who also stars "20 Cent", "Busco", "Crime Ferpecto", "Between Live and Sonar", "Mushrooms" and "Octavia".
