I've seen The Running Man several times as I'm a fan of Stephen King and I have all of his movies but now it's even better because until 2 days ago I did not know about this site and I did not know the Paul Michael Glaser who was involved with this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grew up watching on the television show Starsky and Hutch. For me, this is a pleasant surprise, because I can not tell how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode in which Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died I cried so much that my father had to move away from the show. What do you expect from a boy at age 12? Now, I intentionally look for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has in his hands I'm so there !!!!!!!! I just have to say happy birthday Paul !!!!!
