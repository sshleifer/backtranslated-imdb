I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's as difficult to present the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very good show with Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even with the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce, but I'm okay with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be easier - this is a long one, and if you do not care about all legal situations can be sad or annoying. I think this presentation is fun enough not to be boring. I just loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should have the chance to judge for ourselves ... I have to say that I loved the show. Maybe, if I read the book again, as I usually do, after watching the movie, maybe I can be more critical. In the meantime, I think it's a good presentation.
