One of the best pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first, appearing as a heavy copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be smart and careful while working with her to find out the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humor and composure as she tries to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about all the cast members who contribute to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges their assumptions about any of the characters. These are programs that restore faith in television drama, while making it almost impossible to accept most of the junk that is filling the radio waves more and more.
