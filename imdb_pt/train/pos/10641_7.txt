This Dolph Lundgren vehicle is a fun action movie, will not win any awards and is not very original, but it delivers the products you would like to see in a dolphen lundgren movie. our man dolph is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a difficult high school and, when taken by terrorists, depends on him to save the day. Make sure the script will not win any Oscar of your good fun and has its explosive action just. Dolph Lundgren gives a good performance, but he comes to life more in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors, but they hold well. all in all the arrest is a nice action movie, but you've seen it a million times before.
