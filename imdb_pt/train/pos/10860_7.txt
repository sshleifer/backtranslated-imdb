This is not as violent as I expected, which makes violent scenes seem even more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are lots of twists and turns, and stabbing your back and crossing the road all the way. the film makes it difficult to know which side a particular character is on. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting insight into the workings of the Triad gang that follows. <br /> <br /> Violence when it comes to brutal, unarmed or martial art scenes with special effects, this is believable in your face violence and throughout the dialogue you are never allowed to forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organization . <br /> <br /> The ending is amazing, but completely consistent and believable.
