This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows of all time on television. I mean the acting is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: an airplane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, Josh Holloway is so good, Jorge Garcia is hilarious, I could continue. In addition, the unexpected twists, the stories of the characters, the song that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has proved himself once again what an excellent writer and producer he is. I mean, this is better than ALIAS and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who is not watching this show should definitely consider getting the DVD and watch it because they are missing out on something great. This show could be the best show in the history of television !!
