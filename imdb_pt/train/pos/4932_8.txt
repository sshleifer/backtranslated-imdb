In Panic In The Streets, Richard Widmark plays the US Navy doctor, who had his week rudely interrupted by a corpse that contains plague. As police officer Paul Douglas correctly points out the guy died of two bullets in the chest. That is not the point here, the two become involuntary partners in an effort to find killers and anyone else exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As pointed out by any number of people, for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to pitch the small parts with someone who appears to be from Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans, where the story goes, I can personally vouch for that. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes may be excused because, as a Marine doctor, he could be put there, but for those who are natives this does not work. <br /> <br /> But with the plague out there and the news being kept secret, the New Orleans Police Department begins to drag the underworld of the city. The dead guy came from a ship from Europe and he had connections from the underworld. A New Orleans slicker played by Jack Palance leaps to a lot of wrong conclusions and begins to harass a cousin of the dead guy who is beginning to show plague symptoms. Palance received great reviews in the first film in which it was reported. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. This happened just before Mostel was blacklisted and by the time he did a specialty of playing it would be tough guys who are really toadies. He plays the same type of role in Humphrey Bogart's The Enforcer. Unfortunately I kind of identify with Mostel in that last scene where he and Palance are being chased by Widmark, Douglas and half of the New Orleans police. Seeing Zero's challenged weight trying to keep up with Palance was another thing, because I'm kind of in the Zero League now in the weight department. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action going in a good clip, there is very little downtime in this movie. If there was less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. Panic In The Streets won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay that year. <br /> Kazan also made good use of the waterfront of New Orleans and the French Quarter. Some of the same types of shots are used later in On the Waterfront. In fact, Panic In The Streets is about people who do not scream when they really should, in their own interest. Much like again with On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic In The Streets makes everyone proud to be associated with it. Now, why did not Elia Kazan get some decent New Orleans people in the little roles?
