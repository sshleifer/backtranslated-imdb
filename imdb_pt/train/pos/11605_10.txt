The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it stars Susan Swift, an exceptional and underrated actress. Time travel movies generally do not interest me or movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. It was not based on outrageous special effects and did not focus so much on time travel that the viewer gets lost and gets confused. This was a really creative film kept simple and focused with great acting from everyone.
