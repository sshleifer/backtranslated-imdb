This is one of the most guilty pleasure movies of all time! <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I still like to see her doing her space clothes "how super cool" with a "how totally Bitchin" belt and stick on rhinestones in the face . <br /> <br /> But anyway, the film is actually one of the few "family" movies that holds its interest. I know the beginning drags, particularly if you know what's going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most stressful segments in a family movie. <br /> <br /> I would not get up in front of millions of people and proclaim love this movie, actually renting it is very embarrassing in itself, but I'll admit here with the internet to hide behind. <br /> <br />
