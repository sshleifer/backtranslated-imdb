Well I disagree with the other review posted. Stones are much better them Magnolia or any of the other movies that have been mentioned. <br /> <br /> especially about non-real characters, I think someone just wrote this just because he never lived in Spanish society like I did (and I'm not Spanish), it's a very real movie with real, well done by one of the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> About being a European film in contrast to an American film, well we different societies, personally I do not like very modern American movies (I like the classics and some of the Andy American movies, but they are very few). <br /> <br /> It's a film about the continuous constitution of a person, like it or not, we all make mistakes, but some can learn about mistakes.
