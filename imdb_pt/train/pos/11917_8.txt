Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. The end, when the whole crowd in the stadium gets up and people raise their hands gives me a shiver every time I see. This is simply brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad boy who so far has been disappointed by someone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is funny and exhilarating. A very good family movie with - I admit - a pretty tacky ending. But in fact, it does not matter, the film maintains its basic quality by good acting and inspiring themes.
