Before seeing Show People, my impression of silent comedy was essentially clowning and just clowning. I could not imagine how the screen comedy could be possible without depending very much on the spoken word or countless falls. But this masterful movie proved me wrong. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedy actress who came before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy mainly because Davies's mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point of wondering if Davies was not one of Ball's major influences. This comes from a 21 year old who had never seen a silent comedy, and I must say that no matter how many specific references to the period you actually have (I do not, apparently), you will not be bored with it. movie. You'll probably laugh more than you would in most comedies. This is not just my favorite silent comedy, but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
