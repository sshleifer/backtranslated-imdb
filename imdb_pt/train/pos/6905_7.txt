I thought that Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for the role of actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his equally perfect role. It was interesting to see how Richard Dreyfuss was reluctant to replace the dictator by his will. But he became more confident and comfortable with the role that time has gone through. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was destined to stay there for over a year he did. I think he stayed because he should see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador. I think he took many things as guaranteed in life and he had to go through a serious confrontation with reality, staying in that country for so long. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ........... that's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
