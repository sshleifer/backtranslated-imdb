The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study on how children who experience violence and isolation within their remote community become troubled young adults who need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty. Whether these tools are followed religion to a fanatical level, take care of others or simply put a macho image while engaging as a prostitute, Villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their even-fragile bodies until they meet again in a hospital for those who suffer from tuberculosis. The cinematographic style of the text is typically visually opulent as one would expect from the Spanish author and is extremely reminiscent of the work of the Spanish Pedro Almod√≥var with themes related to sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. One element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural tone coupled with a claustrophobic realism and contrary to Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The work gives an insight into problems. young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I recommend watching this movie as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable time after viewing.
