Suraj Barjatya is best at wedding movies. And here he is; back to your basics in Vivaah. As the story goes, this is a story that goes from engagement to marriage. A movie that you can watch with all your family around you. A movie you will hate watching alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is better, everything about the film has its own class. There are a lot of scenes that will make you cry and I'm sure if you're watching the movie with your love, both will hold you until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita jodi gave us older movies like Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, it was not well accepted by the public. A truly Shahid & Amrita film.
