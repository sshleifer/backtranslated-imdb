Eytan Fox did it again: move the viewer's heart into a modest story that takes place in an oppressive mess. The film also manages to describe so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I've been there for a month and it's all there: the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart- beating the city, the mess, the utopian mentality cluster in the most carefree, joyful and alien mega-cities always. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend: it is a journey to the heart and mind, with an interesting perspective for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Bene: There is a central gay plot in the movie. If you do not think you are very gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as "just love". (and do not worry: the girl is hot too!)
