I feel a mixture of confusion and various degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All good and good, and certainly not everything perfectly done. However, I feel that a crucial point about this film is being overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying it. This is a bold move in the movie world today, and a rare treat for fans of independent films. And, in fact, it may not be the last. Pensacola is world renowned as a Navy town, a city of aviation, a city of wood, and sometimes even as a focus of political controversy. Rarely is it seen as a city of growing movies. But all this is changing now. More movie companies are coming to film. And more native thinkers are discovering the power of cinema by themselves. This movie is part of a growing trend of Pensacola-based indie films, and more are on the way. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community and, little by little, the world is taking notice. See and hear, world. The Pensacolans are coming. Like a virus.
