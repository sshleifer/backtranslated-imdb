"Cut" is a complete parody of the slasher genre and, above all, it achieves what it proposes to do. Most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the scary old house, the forest, the indestructible anonymous serial killer, buckets of blood and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they are having sex (this is not a spoiler). The set The simplicity itself: the film school nerds prepare to complete an unfinished masterpiece of slasher, unfinished because of the murders of a cast. That too sharply - all right, confused - dismisses Kylie Minogue on the first roll. They are accompanied by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the film because it gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast fits well in their roles, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays straight as chaos and blood explode around her. <br /> <br /> There are lots of red herrings and fake moments of suspense, and there is very little time to try to figure out who the killer is because the movie moves at such a fast pace. It also has a proper low budget appearance, including some awkward issues that are probably deliberate. Good soundtrack too. If there is a difficulty with this film, it is deciding whether it is a delivery or a tribute to the slasher genre. Probably a little of both.
