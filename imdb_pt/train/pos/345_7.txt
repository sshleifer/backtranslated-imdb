The first hour of the movie was boring, to say the least. However, it improved afterwards as the Valentine's Feast began. In addition to the turnaround as to the murderer's identity at the end, the scene of the hot bath murder was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this film. The scene in the garden with Kate was well filmed and so was the last scene (the 'twist'). In these scenes, there was some genuine suspense and excitement, and the scene of the hot bath murder had a lousy (the way the slashers should be) for that. The previous killings are frustratingly devoid of blood.
