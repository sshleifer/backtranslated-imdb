Okay, basically this is a science fiction movie of popcorn, but from the outset it's obvious that it was directed with a lot of intelligence. You can count on about 10 cliches that the movie is building, but it only comes in about three of them, and a couple of them has a twist that lets you know once again that the director has not assumed that you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is truly superb and brings character depth that is surprising and rewarding. Recommended if you just see something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
