"Casomai" is a masterful tale that portrays the story of a young couple walking through the dark waters of the wedding. History is very credible in saying the strange seesaw between forgetting and the continuous interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (one might wonder if such events are different elsewhere, however). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that's one of the strengths of the film. Acting for Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and exciting. And the nice priest's figure is funny and well-rounded. All in all, a truly deserving movie, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
