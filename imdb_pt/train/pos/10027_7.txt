Of course, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion on the movie will definitely change. The first time you watch the movie, you see the underlying love story and you think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think that) is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, when will this ship sink? And even that is not so impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but neither is great. I was glad DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for that movie, I mean, who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes a half-good movie and does not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are almost no movies with him in it. But enough, in my eyes, is the worst character in the movie. The performance of Kate Winslet, on the other hand, was wonderful. I also think the director is very talented to put together a movie of such magnitude. There is a lesson to be learned about this movie: there are many love stories, filmmakers should not try to add a bad romance to every movie! Of a possible 100%, I give this film only 71%.
