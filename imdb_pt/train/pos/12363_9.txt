This 1986 Italian-French remake of the 1946 film of the same name lights up early and does not let us breathe. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not take his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day he follows her and his persistence is worth it. There is only one problem: she is committed to a superficial character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who may or may not have committed a heinous crime, and if he repents, he will probably be released with a slap on the wrist. In addition, the girl is a little "funny in the head", and this is corroborated when we find out that she was seeing the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is matched only by her prodigious sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot from the outset with great contacts and an explosive performance from Detmers, who plays us like a yo-yo (as she does with the boy) from scene to scene, with enough suspense to let us guess until - and even after the end. Available in versions rated R and X (!).
