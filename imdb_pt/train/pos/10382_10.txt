As with all other reviewers, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library researching everything I could in this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, all I could find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900s. From Fastward to 2002, after years of researching eBay in a weekly magazine . base and there it was, a VHS copy of the movie. There was another bidder, but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy I gave her. Despite having a copy, I still searched and finally tried to find a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie.
