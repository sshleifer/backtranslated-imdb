I only saw this movie, I first saw it when I was 7 and could almost remember the end. So I watched it like, 10 minutes ago, and (I can look like a baby like I am 12 ha-ha) I started crying in the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was sad because of Anne-Marie because she said 'I love you Charlie' and also: 'I'm going to miss you, Charlie', it just made me really cry ha-ha. has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth watching. WATCH THAT ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but, I love this movie, it's a true classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
