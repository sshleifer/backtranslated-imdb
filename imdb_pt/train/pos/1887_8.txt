Arthur is a rich middle-aged boy who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says what comes to his mind. He likes to brag about his riches and knows he's a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he does not know and thinks it's funny. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really strange). <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie. I watched this movie because the famous Indian movie 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur', I think it's two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. It's very tacky at times. There are so many fantastic liners in the movie. It's not a riot of laughter, but it has some great moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©'s father and he keeps talking about the moose. Duddley Moore certainly has some comedic time. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene in which he speaks standing up for a couple sitting in the hotel about a "small" country and he continues talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud won an Oscar for this movie. I do not know this actor. I do not think he did a great job, but it might be if I watched more of his work I can agree on in the future. The movie has some flat patches, but not too long. eager to watch the sequel.
