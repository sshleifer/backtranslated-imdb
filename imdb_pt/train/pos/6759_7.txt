WHERE THE RIDE WALK deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time, he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney here is underutilized in what stands for more a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Andrews. <br /> <br /> He plays a hard and hard cop used to deal with a band of bandits. very vigorously until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him. When the suspicion falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he goes along with the murder investigation, but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the taxi driver's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, sounds a bit too elegant for the girl she's playing here and does not seem to fit the squalid elements of the story. <br /> <br /> History turns the investigation around. goes deeper and it is discovered that the murdered man had a silver plaque on the head of his service as a war hero. In the end, it turns into a tale of morality, with Andrews developing an awareness of his crime. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating how film noir with performances capable of a strong support cast. A good entry into Noir's field, vigorously directed by Preminger and very well interpreted by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight miscastimento of his character.
