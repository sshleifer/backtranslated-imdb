This work is less about the character of Steve Martin Davis, than about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue inserted via Davis is a contemplative, almost poetic existentialism at its best. He is witty, intelligent, and considerate in delivering messages and content. The writers deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Presentations are easy, relaxed and natural; exactly what you would expect from "A List" actors. Martin contributes the performance that leads to his latest salesperson, guiding him through life, love and the pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film, and as such, his performance is crisp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work deals with life in all aspects. It engenders a real emotional investment in your characters, and leaves you feeling hopeful that Humanity is not doomed, after all, no matter what YOU believe, deep down. <br /> <br /> In all? This is delightful, with one or two dark moments and an easy natural dialogue that draws you in, helping your audience get great pleasure from this work. Definitely worth your time, although it might not be the best choice of all as Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really liked the intelligence displayed. It is not typical and it was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty displayed here. Couples and friends hold detailed conversations that look and sound totally honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and will add it to the DVD collection soon. <br /> <br /> He ranks a 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> the Demon :.
