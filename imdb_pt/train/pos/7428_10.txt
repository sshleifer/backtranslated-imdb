I swear when I first saw this movie, I cried with my eyes closed! STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is like, despite the obstacles that John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to miss a love like that at the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one more look at you / Watch closely now, it's pure magic! This movie made the Evergreen song one of my favorites, and the Queen Bee is such fun music. I also love the fashion of the 70's (except the Afro of Streisand. Besides, she's a beauty). Star is Born is my number one favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and it is a heartbreak in the end.
