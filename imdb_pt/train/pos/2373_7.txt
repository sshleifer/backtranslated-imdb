The new Pendragon Pictures film, "War of the Worlds" by H G Wells, the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. A theatrical version was planned for the beginning of this year (March 2005), but this never happened. The DVD was released to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which hits theaters on June 29. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How faithful is the adaptation? It's not 100% true to Wells's book, but 90-95% faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, like the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the nameless writer / narrator drinking tea with his cousin. But overall, this movie follows the book up close - certainly much more than the classic 1953 version of George Pal. <br /> <br /> Your biggest flaw is that it was obviously made with a very cheap budget. Most appear to have been filmed on blue screen and composed with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the inner scenes and crowded city scenes. The overviews of the London of 1898 look like something from a video game. Numerous scenes in wagons were false - I do not think they could rent a horse. The only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints, they have been able to do enough. Artistically, the movie looks right. The Martians and their tripods are very well made and very faithful to Wells's descriptions. I was particularly impressed by the heat. Although the sequel to Thunder Child, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they could not afford more realistic scenarios, or better animation. <br /> <br /> The acting and direction will not win any Oscars. Most of the time, they are competent, not bad, but they are not exceptional. The music is very good as well, although not on an equal footing with any of the major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that this has not been released in theaters, because budget capping would have done it. it looks much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would classify it similarly to an adaptation of the classic BBC-TV literature. <br /> <br /> A few details: most scenes are presented with various color filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used in a very inconsistent way, and it seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD. And the obviously fake mustache of the writer / narrator turns from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Worth seeing? If you can see beyond technical and budget constraints, and get into the story, I think you'll like this, especially if you actually read the original H G Wells novel. If, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, it is best to pass this on (unless you are a fan of MST3K). Be warned, however, that the movie has a total of 3 hours, so I do not recommend watching it all at once. BTW: A totally different version of War of the Worlds (also known as "INVASION") came out on DVD the same month that Spielberg hit theaters: http://imdb.com/title / tt0449040 /. This was also done on a budget, but is updated to the present day as the Spielberg movie - but it's so much better! What's more, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film for his 1978 best-selling album, but that will not be released until 2007.
