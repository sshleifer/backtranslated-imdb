I read many reviews on this site criticizing The Blob for being tacky and cheesy. The film was criticized for its amateur acting and weak special effects. What you would expect from a group of people whose only experience has been in producing low-budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell these over-critical reviewers that this movie has never been that serious. This fact should be evident from the incompatible theme song complete with silly lyrics thrown over the opening credits. For what it should be, this movie is great. I've seen some of the recent ultra low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, which has absolutely no entertainment value or clever thinking behind its plot. BWP was pure excrement. Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted and completely entertaining. The scene in which the old man encounters the meteorite and nudges the mass contained with a stick was excellently made and genuinely creepy. The scene in the doctor's office with Blob moving slowly under the blanket on the stretcher while consuming the old was a cinematic masterpiece of horror. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to get $ 120,000, inflated by the current dollar value, and make a movie anywhere near as fun and or as successful as the Blob. This simply can not be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
