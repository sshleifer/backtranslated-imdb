Given its release time, the story unfolding in 1950's "Panic in the Streets" was not a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed like no one until it is examined by a public health inspector who claims that the corpse carries a variant of the bubonic plague. However, with the current drama in the world today, it strangely helps this movie to seem credible to today's viewers. The cast and staff are impeccable. Richard Widmark in his first role after his performance in 'Night and the City', Jack Palance in his film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A host of unprofessional and uncredited actors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining spaces. Elia Kazan directs the films of Joe MacDonald (later he worked with Richard Widmark again in 1953, far superior to the 'Pickup on South Street') and the great Alfred Newman did the same. Almost everyone involved here did a better job, 'Panic in the Streets' is a very rewarding watch, though. Especially for the cine-noir enthusiast.
