First, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, for finally releasing the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including the limited editions of 1999)! "You're going to Disney World !!!!!" Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) Anyway, Disney continues magic in your movie 1950's classic "Cinderella," the movie that puts fairy-tale movies on the map. . We are all familiar with Cinderella's story, her sisters, her date, the crystal slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just by saying "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, try to come home at midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's a big old fairy tale that kids like, now in movie format (just like on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
