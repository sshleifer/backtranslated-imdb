I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE by the excellent reviews and by the well written writing of a Dramedy - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell starred in the film, you know that an audience will find out how in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a performance which is very fun and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE delivered that promise. <br /> <br /> The movie is so real to many families around the world that they have lost a limb and still went about their lives in search of something that would bring them back to magic. before his loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so well done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and their journeys. The cast, the scenery and the story made DAN IN REAL LIFE a reminder as we headed for the parties ahead.
