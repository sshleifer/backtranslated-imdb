"Stairway to Heaven" is a remarkable invention of cinema, probably never duplicated. I class it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although it is a type of film totally different from "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psychodrama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is the combination of B & W and color images - as in "Oz", but the significance of contrast goes far beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in "Oz." In "Stairway" the purpose and effect of contrast can only be described as powerful. Another bright aspect of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How could anyone have devised a better way to make time stand still? literally? And then there is the Ladder itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real gem.
