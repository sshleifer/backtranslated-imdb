I just saw this at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was funny how the hell is a little surreal. It happens in Toronto, where these two losers live in this house in the middle of an expressway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are great as the two losers who want the world to simply disappear. The acting, dialogue and writing are very good, and the whole movie looks great for a low budget film. Director / screenwriter Vincenzo Natali was present at this screening, and he looked so smart and down to earth. This guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets that it puts the shit out of Hollywood's budget in shame!
