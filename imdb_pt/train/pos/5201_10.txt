The Human Tornado is a 70-year-old Blaxploitation movie, starring comedian Rudy Ray Moore, in perhaps his most engrossing role to date. The film tells the story of Dolemite, a crook who is on the wrong side of a racist white sheriff sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and travels to sunny California to visit an old friend, nightclub owner (and Madame for the Dolemite "ladies") called Queen Bee. However, it seems that a rival nightclub owner with connections to the Mafia is trying to intrude on his racket, so Dolemite solves the problem with his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore features many diverse talents in this remarkable film, including strong dramatic skills, a Kung Fu domain, an impressive voice (he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack), a moving and compassionate side with the girls, and a general and sense of comic timing. This movie has it all, people: a deep storyline, blistering action, one-minute comedy, beautiful women in trouble, a booming end ... what else could you do with a movie?
