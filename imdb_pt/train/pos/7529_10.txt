Two years have passed and almost everyone seems different, some for the good and some for the worst. I still liked it as much as I did the original though. <br /> <br /> Some flaws they had how to change the Joker he now has no red lips and looks more black hair and black pupils, he is still voiced by Mark Hamill which is a plus I guess. They made the Poison Ivy whiter, implying that she is becoming more like a plant and Catwomen looks very different and not as "attractive" as she was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Croc Killer and the Scarecrow seem to fuck, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as bleak as the original because Batman does not work as alone as he used to. Most of the time working with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to the rescue frequently. Batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing in his suit and it looks like he got a little bigger but still kicking tons of ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original mainly because of some of the renovated characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" may be one of the biggest episodes of Batman, so be sure to check it out. <br /> <br />
