The sisters in law will be released in theaters on March 24 in Sweden. A good time for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg, along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, "director in focus" of the festival. She gave a much-appreciated masters degree on her method as a documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances that led her to shoot Sisters twice: the first version was lost forever, then a second shoot was arranged and the movie turned out to be different in the end. A very terrible problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong film.
