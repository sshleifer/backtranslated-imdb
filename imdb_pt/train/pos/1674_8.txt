Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adulterous wife of a great businessman who inherits $ 1 million life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash during a business trip - initially she is suspected of being responsible as her recently. was changed and so she has an insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her ass just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece, to profit from his inheritance, but insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turnaround in events. Lynch, whose identity is now known as Baumer tries to protect her against a lover of her husband Lara Florakis who, however, along with her henchman, Sharif tries to kill them for a part of the money she considers entitled. And that's where our masked killer begins his brutal murders. Lynch as usual with our hero is at first suspected by the Greek Police and is advised not to leave Athens by Police Inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli a familiar face in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then aided by the beautiful Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the murders. To say that someone else could ruin the movie for those who have not seen it, then suffice it to say there are enough red herring and more of them plausible to keep Mystery / Thriller fans happy in this driven Giallo story. DVD No Shame has a superb transfer with both English and Italian soundtrack. It also has a very captivating score just for good measure by Bruno Nicolai that will stay in your head for a while .... all in all a first level Giallo.
