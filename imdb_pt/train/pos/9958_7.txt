"There is nothing intrinsically incorrect in the grammar of the Caribbean English. it's just the grammar of standard Canadian English.References about the dialogue seem insignificant.I put the subtitles because I'm a Canadian standard.Ã® speaker, then I simply assumed AUTOMATICALLY that I would have difficulty understanding all this.It was not that hard and gave a distinctly different flavor as the other step films that I saw were so American. <br /> <br /> I loved that this film was set up in Toronto and, indeed, I would which was more clearly defined there.

If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard you have learned to speak, your tense mind may find it difficult to enjoy this film.
