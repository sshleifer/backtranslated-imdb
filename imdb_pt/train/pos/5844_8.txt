In 1948, this was my favorite movie of all time. Betty Grable's costumes were so breathtaking that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the bold Hungarian official. Silly and cute as this movie could appear at the beginning, when I was eight years old, I seemed to say something important about the relationships between men and women. I saw it again the other day; I was surprised to find out that this was still happening.
