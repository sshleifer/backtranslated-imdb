"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, is a CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen all the episodes, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which is my favorite. Also, I really love the theme song. If you ask me, even if I like everyone, it would be cool if everyone had stayed on the show all season. Everyone always performed well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen on TV Land right now, I strongly recommend that you take it just in case it leaves the air forever.
