I'm going to tip the scales here a little and say that I liked that. However, the cartoon really will only appeal to those who have very absurd tendencies. It is definitely something that most people will not understand as well as the nature of the absurd. <br /> <br /> The animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is dirty of mouth, violent and stupid. there are no redemptive qualities. his wife screams and whines, seemingly ill-able to the most basic communication skills. most of these stories are completely without any kind of argument. <br /> <br /> But again, that's the point;) <br /> <br /> If non sequiters, dirty language, and total and total randomness are your thing, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> It's too short so I'd probably rent it instead of buying it.
