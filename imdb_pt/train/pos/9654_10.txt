Stephane Rideau was already a star of his strength tour in "Wild Reeds", and he is one of the biggest indie stars in France. In this film, he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a dazzling performance, full of nuances) on the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two are falling in love. The fractured narrative of the film - which is made up of long flash-backs, bits and pieces of the present, and moving forward in real time to the future - is a bit scary. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not signal what time frame we are in, and the plot can be difficult to follow. But hold on: The final 45 minutes of the movie are so engaging that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. In turn, heartbreaking and uplifting, this film ranks "Beautiful Thing" as a must-see movie.
