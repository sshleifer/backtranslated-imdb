Great movie! Rented the DVD recently and it was paved by this impressive work. Douglas Sirk was a film genius and earned performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominee) and Lauren Bacall that words can not describe. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly paid tribute to this film for having Dorothy Malone playing the inspiring guru of Sharon Stone in her Wild Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> By turns, the movie is hilarious, fascinating, flamboyant, scathing, worthless, attractive and twisted! It's definitely the grandaddy of all the big and small telenovelas but none has had the stunning style as you'll see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening montage to title music is unforgettable, the one-dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will make you scratch your head about how the censors of the time leave the final cut! <br /> <br /> Although older, highly viewed movies can sometimes be a tedious task to sit in, written in the wind contains a lot and passes so fast that it's really a shame when it ends. Thanks to Mr. Sirk for creating - and Todd Haynes for calling attention to what has now become one of my all time favorite movies! SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
