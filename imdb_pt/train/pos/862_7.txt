Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she finds herself overwhelmed at work, she is able to hire Paul to help her. Paul is out of jail and his past is not totally behind him. To say much more about the story, which has many twists, would be a mistake. The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how the sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when she can not - a sort of "point of hearing" (as a point of view). The early scenes that set it up, as well as the initial character development of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the later twists, some of which were difficult to follow and / or extended credibility a bit. There is also some unpleasant violence. Back on the plus side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing, but it may not be what you are looking for. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
