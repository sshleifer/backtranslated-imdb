Much has been written about "The House of the Games" by Mamet; most of it is good. I decided to revisit the movie to see how it remained after 17 years and was amazed at how much I enjoyed seeing it again. The success and durability of the film probably have a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun in the movies; a good story and a good farce. Mamet manages to bring her characteristic moodiness and her obvious histrionics to the film while deceiving us, the audience and the brand simultaneously. Then he explains the art of deceiving just to do it again, etc., while building the story. "The House of Games", now a cable freebie, is worth looking for newbies and a good reprise for Mamet fans. (B +)
