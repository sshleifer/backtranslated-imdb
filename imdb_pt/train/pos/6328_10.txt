It is so gratifying to see a great work of art converted into another without distortion or artifice. I had no way of guessing how an extraordinary literature could be re-created as a film worthy of being seen. If you loved Bulgakov's book, you would be understandably scared to see misinterpretations made more because of an art film project than by actually bringing the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are some examples of this with Master and Margaret. As complex and forceful as the story, the film leaves nothing out. It is as if the filmmaker were reading Bulgakov's work in the same way that an orchestra conductor reads a score - without a note being lost. Why can not we find such talent here in the US? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
