This movie is a must-see for all. Congress should see this documentary true from the standpoint of the soldier, just like everyone else in America. The previous reviewer has totally missed the point - the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who only live in the territory of our "enemy", and what he does to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY, before another person is killed or injured. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are mentally injured, post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
