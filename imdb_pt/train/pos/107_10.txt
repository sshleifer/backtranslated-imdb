Lars Von Triers Europe is an extremely good movie. How's that? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he had with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even though I've seen it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this movie is the most complete, REAL and moving film than most of the top 250 movies. I also think it's perhaps the scariest, the most gothic and complete film in the world. Okay, there are other good ones too, but this is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most distressing scenes of all time.
