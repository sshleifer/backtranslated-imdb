There's a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas. Before he can reap the rewards of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded monk. After a co-ed is killed in a church by gas, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The Killer. Which is not to like a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red KKK outfit, complete with red gloves. The white whip he wears and wears very effectively stands out well against the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a killer in a red, pointy outfit around a girl's school is quite exaggerated, it is one of the most sinister fantasies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I'd really like to track down the title song for The College Girl Murders. It has a jazzy and modern feel that I simply loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre ringtones. In addition to the red dress and killer hood, the film features a sliding fireplace, an alligator pit with an overhead cage, poison bibles, a strategically placed dummy, mini skirts, go-go boots, and tall hair. I would describe it as a cross between the 1960s Batman TV show and an Italian giallo. The College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - The End. Let's just say there are more twists and turns than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer was discovered, here comes a turnaround ... and another ... and another and another. What does not work: -> Inspector Chief Sir John. I know the guy was meant to be a comic relief, but his buffoon character has a lot of time on the screen. <br /> <br /> - Why have alligators? Earlier, I mentioned the alligators in the well. And while they are a nice touch, they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the problems and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Lot. Some of the girl's college murders have no flow or rhythm to it. There are many moments throughout the film when things inexplicably come to an abrupt halt. Better pace would have made this a much nicer movie. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these German krimis, but from the few I've seen (Ghost of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, London Eye) this may be my favorite. This one has a real funky feel to it that I actually enter. If the plot had run a little better, I could have easily given a 7/10 to The College Girl Murders.
