I wish I could laugh as much as when I first saw this show. I have not done that since. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I see myself laughing almost as much after watching the program again, and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, is pungent, is a man of the world. He is adept at talking about politics and yet he feels no need to "engage" in political discussion. He is above that. I would contrast him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to convince people of his ideas, and does not seem to like the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The funniest guy on earth
