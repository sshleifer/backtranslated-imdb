"The Godfather" on television, but in addition to their acclaimed and mafia characters, the two are nothing alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in one family he is a loving father and still a not-so-perfect husband, and in the other family he is a relentless wiseguy. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems really derive from his mother, Livia, who is suspected of having borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand are not as well known for their equally talented performances as the psychiatrist and the mother respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and arrests. Chianese, the only recurring actor to have appeared in a "Godfather" movie, plays Tony's uncle and his irreversible enemy. Many fans also liked characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's sons are "well", but they are not remarkable (with the exception of Iler's impressive performance in the third to last episode, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are not convincing and are exaggerated, but the show is too strong for them not to go back. Even if the show continues for more than six seasons, it no longer has a monotonous or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (of four)
