That's good bit shocking; is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but tight, competent, and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea developed in a convincing 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> The montage does not require bells and whistles, no lengthy exposure or a story behind; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German businesswoman living in London, falls asleep while waiting for the last subway train. She wakes up to find the place deserted, but quickly realizes that she is far from alone. Someone, or something, is there with her and her intentions are totally malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, she finds several other characters in her quest for survival, including a lecherous work colleague, a homeless couple and a caged. sewer, all of which add rhythm and substance to the plot. There is a clumsy shift somewhere in the middle of the movie, when the tension thriller turns into gay fest, but nothing so clumsy as to slow the frenzied pace. For those of you with weak dispositions, it is likely to be an agonizing walk; for those of you who like a bit of well-executed carnal disorder, this should press all the right buttons. The movie's climax may be less successful than the main body of the film, but it is punctuated with a good moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfying conclusion. Some may find themselves feeling a bit misled by a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by Kate and her confederates, however, for me, that was not the case. A writer of horror films should not feel compelled to punctuate each one and cross everywhere, just as one would expect a writer of political suspense. There are enough clues here to give you a very clear idea of ​​what brought this evil into existence, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. The retention of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride would always be more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> My understanding is that the budget for this film was, to say the least, minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror must be even higher, because at no time do you get the impression that the corners are cut off or the effects are not enough. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like your kind of movie, then it probably is. Buy a ticket and get on board.
