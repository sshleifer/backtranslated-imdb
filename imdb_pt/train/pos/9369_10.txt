This film is proof that the film noire is a long-lasting style and extremely worthy of staying alive. For me, it's the best example of film noire since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you'll never get the recognition you deserve. It was never promoted properly when it was first released and had to build its fan base through venues like the Vanguard Cinema and rental word of mouth references. <br /> <br /> I recommend that people looking for something more than stupid entertainment rent this movie and plunged into their highly complicated plot.
