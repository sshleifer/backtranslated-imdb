Any movie in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph for the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in a touch of evil. Please see everyone! It tends to get pompous and self-serving in films like F is for Fake, really stupid waste of film. Do not waste your time watching. is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who is studying film should see everything he has filmed. All her main ladies are tremendous, but in the end Welles has become a fat drunk, like her character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not as Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on, but I digress ... and as a woman, I can see the attraction for him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers, and unless you tell the current filmmakers: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers simply can not compare to the filmmakers of the forties! I know there are many other great filmmakers today, but in such a short time I can not name all of them. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of some current and future filmmakers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some of the movies released now, but there are rarely any that I put on a "100 Best" list. "Hustle and Flow" was great, as was "Fargo", and "Oh, brother, where are you" from a line on Sullivan's trips; another fine Thirties movie! Can anyone give me a better list for the 90's and until 2006? I wish I knew who to watch! Thank you! Also join this site! Where else can you hook up a movie or boo it! I love the ranting and raving of ordinary people like me who can say what I want and promise not to ruin any movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
