The first movie ever made. Workers flowing from a factory, some pedaling, most walking, moving to the right or to the left. Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the starting point of the cinema - with Melies begins the narrative fiction, the cinema, the fantasy, the artifice, the spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who lament the ossification of cinema from the latter to the tired formulas of the former. <br /> <br /> But let's consider this short again. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The film is full of action - a static and inhuman scene explodes in life, activity and the silent harmony of the picture is broken, decentralized from the back to the right or to the left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). And yet the camera stands still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. Cinematography can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map the world, to edit it, to restrict it, to limit it. <br /> <br /> Worst is the historical reality of the film. These workers are employees of Lumiere. The bosses are spying on their workers, their eyes invisible to their faceless minions. The film, therefore, describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, the workers are confined to their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, confining them further. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an invisible, all-seeing authority image, imprisoning its servers. A scary and very prophetic movie.
