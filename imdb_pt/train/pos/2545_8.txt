Invisible Ray is an excellent display of both the talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff takes an impeccable performance as a grumpy, conflicted scientist who seems to place his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable when he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to maintain good relations with everyone, but still does not seem to have close friends. This was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays very well. It is difficult, however, to hear his accent and to believe that he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film was that it was all based on junk science, but in some ways even the science of pornography makes it work well. Since the ideas and theories are completely stupid, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the film was made. And they are also so advanced - and always will be. <br /> <br /> This is a perfectly delicious movie to watch again and again. I've seen maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily sit five more times. The acting is wonderful and science is fun. I recommend.
