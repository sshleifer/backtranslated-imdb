This movie literally has all the cliches of action movies and they all work in your favor. Straight from the lethal weapon Gary Busey, mocking, filming and laughing through this film with such a reckless abandon that can not but amuse and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans and if they are not enough reasons to watch this movie, then how about the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, you probably will not like this movie.
