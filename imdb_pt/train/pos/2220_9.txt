We tend to forget that the master / slave context of past centuries has led to more than well-maintained properties, driven by large groups of enslaved people, and too much money for white owners. This led to a group of people caught in the middle - the resulting offspring of slave owners interfering with their slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children became more slaves, and others were free ... but free and colorful, which at that time meant anything, less in relation to the lot of their parents. A class formed around these descendants-the gens de couleur libre or free people of color-and this class was capable, to some degree, of possessing property, rising from the oppressed to the educated, and achieving a comparative dignity. That is, they were not slaves, but they were still exploited to some extent. <br /> <br /> Women often lived as lovers of the white plantation masters and men of wealth, established in their homes. homes with subsidies, schooling paid for their children and a kind of kindness, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families. In essence, they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from work - an arrangement called pla√ßage. All Saints' Feast is a beautifully written story about the children of one of these women, the result of such an arrangement with a local gentleman and the people who touched their lives, both negatively and positively . The tale was an eye opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black / white lines, much less that gray area in the middle where the gens of free couleur walked cautiously. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and were well presented in this adaptation of the novel, by Anne Rice. The pieces are well-shaped, the costumes are wonderful and the brutal mode as the lines are drawn, with the blurred areas made even more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through. The gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic, could not bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people on whom they depended. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story, both the novel and the mini-series, for everyone, without reservations. If you can not deal with the truth, you will shrink and shrink through some parts, as one injustice after another is imposed upon by both your white oppressors and your own people. Keep in mind that this is nothing but reality, and this tale is an absorbing way of learning about it. <br /> <br /> I know it may seem insensitive, but this miniseries entertained and enchanted me, after all. the sour taste I found in my mouth with what happened, and I really enjoyed it. Watch. If it is not read in the period, because there is a lesson to be learned from all this.
