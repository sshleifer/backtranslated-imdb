It's not well filmed, well written or well-represented, but it has to be the most addictive program I've seen since the Twin Peaks. Each revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. They even slowed down the show where they reveal only small amounts of information per episode, yet it seems they just said everything you wanted to know. However, some of the performances are terrible and some of the duologues are downright brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out about actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the program can also be very frustrating, since the following episode may not show what the previous episode took. Irritating secondary lots have become part of the story that sometimes do not tell you anything. However, the second season has developed to a point where the stories behind reveal more about the island than before. All in all it's a great show but not perfect.
