After some difficulty, Johnny Yuma arrives at his sick uncle's ranch to take over the day-to-day operations only to find out that the old man was murdered by his beautiful wife and the woman's cruel brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, a delightful performance by Mark Damon, and an action-packed animated script combine to make this a fun, if not exceptionally deep, above-average addition to the spaghetti western genre. <br /> <br /> The star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest girls in Europe who has already graced the screen. Here she is absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted (and abusive) heart user of weak men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri have appeared together in at least one other photo, The Devil's Wedding Night, a good horror movie that is of special interest to those of you who want to see what's underneath the dresses Rosalba.
