When I saw this movie, I was impressed that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should be in theaters. I have seen many movies about rape, but this one stands out. This movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in today's movies, let alone in TV movies. He tells a story that I'm sure is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today, and I found it very convincing (which is hard to find in other rape-centric films). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were amazing in the parts they played. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that have a harsh reality for them. I liked very much.
