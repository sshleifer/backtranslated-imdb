As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan films. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the film, as it seems a fairly accurate description of what a trading post must have been. Also, exposure is needed to let us know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and terrifying chase sequences ever made. This occurs when Harry's safari group has to flee a tribe of cannibals. The values ​​of pre-censorship production add a lot of realism, genuinely representing the terrible dangers awaiting Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps beforehand, a precise account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. Plus sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two cheats! Not to miss an adventure classic.
