Although this film has put Davis on the map because of its brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this movie is strangely unsatisfactory to me as a whole. The acting is really good in almost every way. What I can not understand for the life of me is how or why Phillip, a sensitive and well-mannered young man would accept the constant abuse that this tramp constantly makes toward him: I think his naive tolerance is unbelievably unbelievable in certain aspects. Yes, I know he is a sensitive and introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a venomous witch that no one who learned would tolerate his attitude or actions and make it believable. Davis is amazing in her role: yes she can overdo it in her histrionics from time to time, but it is a vividly creative portrait anyway you look at it. Too bad she was not playing a gangster brat. Your character would have been completely believable as a homeless bum!
