I just came back from the first showing of Basic Instinct 2. I was going there thinking it would suck at critically previewing and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original basic instinct, I think you'll like number 2 as much as not more. Great story that always makes you think and think. The music is superb, repeating the theme of the original. Do not expect Oscar material, go see it for pleasure and fun. That's what movies are designed for - escapism. I can not think of a better way to escape than to run away with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as ever. I'm thinking of seeing you again this weekend. Go and see!
