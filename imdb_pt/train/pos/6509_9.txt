I can not believe some of the reviews on this show! The show is just great! Of course it does not follow the proven and true, but we, as consumers, always want the same things that push us over and over again. Should not we have the option to sit and enjoy something new from time to time? The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it should not be. The show titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Hint" from the title states that the entire cast of other interpretations would constantly participate in the action. And nowhere do they say they were solving mysteries, and they can not even stand monsters, so why would they? I'm really glad they put some long-running plot points that work on a Scooby-Doo show. They even have chain jokes, awkward hi-jinks, quick-change clothes in chase scenes, the standard hallway gag and even Scooby snacks. Actually, I'm glad this show is out there, because I just love it. Thankfully they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and focused on just two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> Of course it's ridiculous, it should be! Of course it's different, it should be. It's supposed to make you laugh at the villain, and cheer for the idiot robotic butler to triumph over all the intrusive worms no matter the size. You should have the "Roobi-Roo" joke. The whole thing is so well done, there is not a single thing I can think of that is wrong with that. The writing, the acting, the animation, everything first. The title song is amazing (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it's initialized), and the background music is exciting.
