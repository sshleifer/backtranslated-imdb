This movie is the best movie to watch the comic feel. The scenarios, costumes and colors are so vivid that it's like getting into a comic book. This is the movie I think of when the crowd is mentioned, the suits, the hats and the attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can not help but feel sorry for Madonna while she tries and fails to beat Tracy. This movie contains all the classic Mafia clich√©s - burying people on concrete, blowing up people's cars, tying the good guy and trying to blow up your girlfriends house. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic ever. the word, even the camera angels scream comics. It's so nice to be able to go back to an old movie and see that someone knew how a comic book should be turned into a movie after seeing errors like Spawn and the Hulk. <br /> <br /> YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
