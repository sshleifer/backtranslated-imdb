As part of the celebration of the launch of Casino Royale, this film with the new starring Bond was shown by director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned him off because he was a bit annoying, but I'm glad I stayed with him. Basically, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees someone and has not had boyfriend for years. Her daughter says she may want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After meeting for only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age, in her 30s, and the new Bond? Either way, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but May laments and wondered if Helen will find out. When she does, Darren is less annoyed than May. In fact, Helen asks permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English as Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
