I saw this movie for the first time 20 years ago and I never forgot it. It's beautifully filmed and the story retains a rivet all the time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946, since the tale is still recent and really makes you think. I'm not very knowledgeable about film technique, however, the special effects in this movie are great considering when this was done. Moreover, the acting is superb and the use of English and American actors is amazing. I recently bought the DVD and now I can watch whenever I want. I highly recommend anyone interested in British postwar movies to watch this.
