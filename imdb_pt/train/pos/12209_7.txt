I was very impressed with this small and independent image. The story, about a couple of social outcasts who meet, become friends and provide each other with a support system that does not seem to have children, is sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad but always provocative. Music, mostly by underground bands, was used to great effect, as was experimentation with camera angles, filters, and slow or fast motion techniques. The performances (the protagonists are interpreted by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best I have seen in the last two years. If you've ever felt like a square piece being forced into a round slot, I truly believe you'll appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
