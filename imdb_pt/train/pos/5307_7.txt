"Pecker" is a young, unfamiliar photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public, media and local art scene with his photos showing the dirty reality of everyday life as dirty underwear or human excrement. It is a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore's independent comedies to show the strange sides of the American way of life between politically correct fashion and conservative setbacks, exploring the background of the middle-class society of his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong's "Terminator 2" fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, the legendary Patricia Hearst and long-time actress of Water, Mink Stole. Although the rhythm of the plot becomes a major flaw sometimes it can not compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water's brilliant "Serial Mom", it still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like an ex -viciated in drugs that became vegetarian by smelling peas from a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the artistic scene, the media advertisements, the middle-class sexual anguish, and the strange forms of to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
