The animation always seems to be marginal. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the US, the animation has a big tag "KIDS". France is probably one of the most liberal comic countries, home to classics like Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you've never read these, it's not too late.) There is no age limit on them and they do not carry the nerd stigma of DC or Marvel) It seems natural that a movie like this should appear in France. It adapts to my prejudiced image of the French as art-loving, anti-US and talented filmmakers. Fortunately there is also "A Gloomy Scanner" out there to suppress this view - it looks like the art is virtually international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have noticed, the Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person, you will be scared of it. No need for this though! Underneath its elegant and somber appearance, there is a good thriller and a good movie overall. <br /> <br /> That was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy to turn the spectacular animation into a trick, much like what Sony and C: are doing with their Pixar scams. I was expecting a confusing movie, sometimes annoying and not very engaging, but fortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have liked either of the neo-noir things, but it was nice that it was worth that level too. NOTE: I saw the French dub that was fine as far as I could see. English can be more interesting with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> A final word of praise to animation. It was amazing. Future, well-crafted, good camera work, smart solutions (eyes, for example, looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning that I felt like bursting out "This is so awesome!" So again, I really like animation and I appreciate the studio effort, so my verdict is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> Good movie anyway, definitely lives beyond its "trick".
