This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to restart after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here, and she is opening a piano school, but she also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from death. If that's what the movie was about, it probably would have been like a Hollywood movie, with it falling in love with some local guy and being happy with his son in his new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, apparently because she is known to have money from the settlement. The process of mourning, attempts to move forward, attempts to clear her guilty conscience, everything is done wonderfully, and the leading actress is superb. The only caveat, and has to be stated, is that this is a depressing movie. You have to know what is happening. You want Shin-a to go through your pain and find some measure of happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it is Korea and in Korean cinema, especially the drama, they do not give punches. Life is what happens to you. Great acting, but sometimes a difficult movie to watch due to events. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
