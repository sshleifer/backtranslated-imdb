The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this movie. Why it has never become a bigger store may never be known. But she's exceptional and steals every scene she's in. Ganson Kanin directed this piece of hair and the cast is top notch, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro especially memorable. A "9" of "10"
