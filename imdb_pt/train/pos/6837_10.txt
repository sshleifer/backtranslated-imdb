A typical De Palma film made with a lot of style and some scenes that will take you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Certainly what makes this movie better than the ordinary thriller, is the style. There are some brilliantly edited scenes and some scenes that really spoil the nerves that will take you to the edge of your seat. The best scene of the film; The scenery of the museum and the murder of the elevator. There are some light erotic scenes and the pace of the movies may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully enjoy this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also very good, but it's really the style that makes the movie work! It may only be for fans, but also casual viewers should appreciate the tension well accumulated in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a cool character portrayed by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice and Angie Dickinson acts as well as she is beautiful (not bad for a 49 year old!). <br /> <br /> The musical score of Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma. likes and adapts very well to the film, as well as his score for De Palma's other film, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant thriller to destroy nerves. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
