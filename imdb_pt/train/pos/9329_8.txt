I saw the perfect son about three times. I can not see how this movie is gay, nor am I gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a movie with a gay character, I do not see why every movie with a gay character should be strictly a movie about being gay. I think the film is sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is his relative. I think Theo spins his life quickly after rehab because he wants and watching his brother die in front of him makes him reevaluate his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he's going to be a dad to be very moving, Ryan states that he does not want to know about things he'll never see or share with anyone. Is not that horrible and sad? I recommend the movie.
