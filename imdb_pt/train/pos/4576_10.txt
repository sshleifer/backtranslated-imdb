I thought this was an absolutely charming movie, centered around the life of Mary-Kate and the characters of Ashley, Sam and Emma Stanton! Both are trying to make them and their parents happy, but; unfortunately, it is not so easy for them to actually do! I thought this was a totally lovely and sweet movie and if you are a true fan of these wonderful young ladies then I'm sure you'll agree with me here! If you have not watched this movie, I say you really missed the chance; great time, and you should definitely take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Regards, Rick Morris
