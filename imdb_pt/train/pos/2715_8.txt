Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV series and really was one of the few that is worth the schedule! I suspect in this era of TIVO and recording devices that it would come out much better than in 1982. I am eagerly awaiting your DVD availability! <br /> <br /> While it's true that he has some in common with other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., all of whom I'm a big fan of, QED had a much more intellectual quality. He did not suffer for it, however - the dialogue was witty and action was high. The show worked in the UK as Mastermind, and had something from the BBC, but with better production values ​​than the BBC normally had at that time. I was a nineteen-year-old boy when this series worked initially and had a lot to do in my life to get time for the television. I remember my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that Q.E.D. was on, and we sat on the phone and watched together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Truly, Q.E.D. it is a sad loss and if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I would love to see it return.
