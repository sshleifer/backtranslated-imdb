A thriller of suspense that bears some resemblance to Deliverance as scenario and scenario. There are also some very innovative scenes and good music, although the idiot and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is inadequate for the situation, although this is not a mayor problem. It also raises interesting questions about fairness of revenge and limits of friendship. <br /> <br />
