I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw this weekend in Seattle and found it very funny. I did not laugh much during a movie in a long time. I thought the whole cast did a great job. You will find yourself laughing from the first moment until the last scene. I suspect that some viewers (especially those who take themselves too seriously) will be turned off by this kind of humor. I do not. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater was rolling with laughter throughout the screening I went to, which makes me think a lot of people had fun and were happy to have fun at the movies for a change. I can not wait to see it again! If you're in the mood for LOL, then this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
