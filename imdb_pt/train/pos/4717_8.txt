How can anyone not love this movie? I think it's a hilarious parody of all the old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, notice that. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role as it's worth everything. A guy manipulates the English language every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays a DAD with no concept, but my favorite role is Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale and Ray Walston are in this movie full of stars that satirizes gangsters a lot funnier than the "mafia" for the underworld of crime.
