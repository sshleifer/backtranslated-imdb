Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest Batman cartoon direct to the video / DVD to be released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new crime fighter, Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a large shipment of weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the film is interesting enough, it's not as good as "Ghost Mask", "Sub-Zero" or "Return of the Joker". The main reason is that it does not exude the emotional appeal of other films. At the end of this movie, we really did not feel much for anyone like we did in others, especially 'Sub-Zero'. There is no real tragedy that has made the other animated films special for us. Even Batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantasma was). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly "stiff" and monotonous that the viewer does not care what happened to her that made her put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we do not have that special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I found the movie enjoyable. He has his moments, like when the public discovers who Batwoman really is and sees an old villain return, last seen in the original "Batman: The Animated Series." The action is also very enjoyable with some moments of much suspense. <br /> <br /> If Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than 'Return of the Joker' in my book, but as it is now, in 4 (out of 4). <br /> <br /> As for animation, it's the same as the New Batman Adventures cartoon of the mid-1990s. The score is not as memorable as the previous three animated Batman movies, but it's still good . <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. But remember, it's not as good as the other animated films from Batman. <br /> <br /> 7/10
