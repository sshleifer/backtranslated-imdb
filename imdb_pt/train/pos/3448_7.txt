A documentary without loss of words ... never ... Let's suppose that the narration is more than a parody, let's say it's a commentary on Japanese society. And as this film is as fast as an absurd documentary as they come, the constant play of words, the fastest it goes, and as poorly translated as it is - in its current version of the film festival as seen tonight at Cinematek de Copenhagen - still quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and ONLY the truly patient and open-minded, I'm talking to you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I believe this is a movie for you. It's a clever movie if you let it conquer you. Pretty pretty, and pretty kitsch, and pretty Japanese sub-culture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world. All in all, Fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie that mimics the culture of Japanese food. Thumb up if you're in the mood for something completely different.
