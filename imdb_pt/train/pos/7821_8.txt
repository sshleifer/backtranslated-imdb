Very rarely Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and thinks that this is true for Kevin Kline, and in that case, it should count as one of his best films. It's more about the movie about how strong friendship can be more than the story of Steve Biko, although we have an idea of ​​what the man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the man's name and leave the world to know what a corrupt and rotten society in South Africa was. The direction is excellent from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi, although if there was any criticism to be directed it could be in the length of the film. Two and a half hours is plenty of time to sit through a historic movie. What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before the dismemberment of Aparthiet and you can not help but be moved by it. 8 out of 10.
