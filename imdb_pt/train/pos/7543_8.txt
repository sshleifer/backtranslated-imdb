this is a visual adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. which dialogue appears in the baloons of words as in the manga. the plot of this is existing, but only vaguely explained. there is a manga issue in which this is based on English available in the collection of explosion books, 'underground japan comics', and has subtitled dialogues that explain the plot a bit more than here. I recommend checking this volume if you liked this because it explains some of the "plot" of the film, which is otherwise inexplicable. animation wise this is pretty decent, good non-intrusive use of computers and the pictures are mostly performed well. he enters and leaves episodes, while the characters, a cat and his brain-dead older sister enter and exit a series of strange images: a boat, a circus, a desert. for just half an hour they go through a series of semi-frames and configurations, which leads me to believe that the director chose a series of long-running manga issues to adapt randomly but primarily visually selected. Knowing what is happening can increase appreciation a little. this mostly reminds me of the kind of thing they used to play in the mtv show, cartoon sushi, especially a short one that shows a cat chasing a man's face all over the house. but in this case the cats resemble the hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a host of other themes [although it is not easy to tell what is happening]. the DVD of this has director comments and a "making of" features, but I can not comment on this because I did not give it back to them. I'm giving an 8/10 now, here is not much to compare it to in anime, and I hope for more like that.
