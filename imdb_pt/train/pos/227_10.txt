Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the film's database of the film. After watching this movie, you may think that Duvall's appearance is reincarnation at its best. One of my favorite movies. I wish composer Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or there was a soundtrack available. Wonderful and "very realistic" landscapes and music, especially for those of us who live or have moved south. This is a "real moment in time". Life advances slowly, but "strangers do not remain."
