"Hollywood North" is a euphemism for the film industry when they went to Canada to make films because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw many California invaders that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the incoming personalities trying to capitalize on the economy that Canada presented. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern," the successful novel written by a Canadian author is turned into "Flight to Bogota," which has nothing to do with the original film. A great selfish has been, Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is offered the main part which becomes a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be saying that many cooks ruined the broth, which seems to be the case of the final product, which is saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who has been around making a documentary of the film being filmed in Toronto, parts of the film are finally turned into a cohesive film. <br /> <br /> The filming process is hilarious, and acting in general is good.
