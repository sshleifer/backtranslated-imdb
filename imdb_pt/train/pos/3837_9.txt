In the 1940s, when the films touched on issues that were not yet admissible in "polite" society, they resorted to codes that supposedly floated over the heads of the majority of the audience, while alerting those who knew what was happening. Probably no movie of the decade was as loaded with insinuations as the strangely obscure Desert Fury, set in a little oasis of play called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage casino and salon is the amazing Mary Astor, in pants and sportive; in the city takes its daughter-filled, Lizabeth Scott, appearing, in Technicolor, 20 million dollars. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older lesbian and her young and restless companion (one can only wonder if the original script by A.I. Bezzerides made this relationship explicit). Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as the city sheriff, move and sit down. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall in love with Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak not only has a past with Astor, but also had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun warms these ingredients to a strong boil, with many blows to the face and exchanges with notes. Do not let go of this greenhouse melodrama, filled with exotic and chilling flowers, if you come in your direction; is a remarkable film.
