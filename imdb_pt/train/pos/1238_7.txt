While this movie has many flaws, it's actually a fun 1980s movie. Eddie Murphy has his peak in the '80s movies here. While your character is indistinguishable from previous films, your time is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils. <br /> <br /> Couple this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, this makes for a fun rainy day action comedy movie. <br /> <br />
