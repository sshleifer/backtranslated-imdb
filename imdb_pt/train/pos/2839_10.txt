I saw this movie on an early preview and found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a true twist on a novel that explores intelligent, funny, and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotion of the human race. The cast is huge, a true Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all give outstanding performances in one form or another. Not to mention that there are those who are those of directors intertwining stories in clever and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WOW! This movie is not a straight-line romance or romantic comedy, although it is romantic and funny. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's good in my opinion. Go see for yourself and answer my comment, I want to hear what others have to say.
