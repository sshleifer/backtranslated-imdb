Okay, let's get this straightened out. I'm not really a science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his SG-1 team through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual science fiction series, but it's not! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium, like many other science fiction series. I think that's great. It gives you things, happenings and things that you can relate to, and you can get into the series anytime without having to learn many new terms and names of all gadgets. They have some, of course, but thanks to O'Neil, who likes to keep a simple terminology, there are not many. <br /> <br /> The series has a nice mix of action, humor and drama. If you like many special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use many bad ones, but a limited amount of well-made special effects.
