Much is dated in this episode (as are most of the Twilight Zone episodes), such as the woman's incredibly sexist "military uniform." And some things are unbelievable, such as the easy availability of clean water. Still, consider the year this was done and the time, and you quickly understand why this episode is as special as you watch. She has a good sense of hope, something lacking in a lot of Twilight Zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact she rarely speaks), something rarer in the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone in just over 20 minutes could pack more emotion and drama than most of the two hours of today's movies. And it's great to see two people who have become American icons so early in their careers.
