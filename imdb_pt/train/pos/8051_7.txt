"Hung is trying to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also in a bit where Hung mocks Jackie Chan's Drunken Master, and the action is also very good, especially when Hung makes a trio of martial arts experts in the end, it's not the best movie, but it's very good for 70's kung fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. have a very bad quality. There is also a character in blackface that some people may find offensive. Sammo Hung is a rural shepherd who moves to Hong Kong to fight some bad guys. Bruce Lee when they fight! <br /> <br /> This movie is often advertised as a parody of "Enter the Dragon" by Bruce Lee, but it's not exactly that ... Sammo is a rural pig shepherd - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives s to run a small outdoor restaurant. At the new job, he is forced to defend the restaurant from local gangsters in search of money for protection. When Sammo enters the fight mode, he calls his portrayal of Bruce Lee, who must be seen to be believed! This film is rather sloppy in many of the fighting scenes Sammo fights against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists, and there is a character who is supposed to be black and is played by an Asian with heavy (and absurd) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy, more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood ".
