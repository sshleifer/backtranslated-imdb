I do not watch much TV, except for The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup. I think I have this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the blunt critique of pop culture that this show gives. Soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp.). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (come on, most people get addicted to watching American Idol because of the show horrors that are auditions), that's why most people claim to watch. And that means, I do not have to suffer from the other 98% of these "reality" talk shows or narcotic shows, for a slice of "funny" or "shock." The only reason Soup does not have 10 in my opinion is that the sketches are not so funny, and on an even rarer occasion, the commentary is not always the same. But not all can be home runs, if so, Soup would not be in E! <br /> <br /> Joel's quick thinking and Soup writer's team (which includes McHale) make a great show. By chance I appreciate the laughter and comments from the team that are off camera. Even when they are being blatantly obvious giving occasional complimentary laughter, it is hilarious because it is forced. They are obviously being ironic. And that's part of what makes this program funny.
