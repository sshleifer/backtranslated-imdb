A Hollywood classic Biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro give spectacular performances in the two major roles, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, with outstanding performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and distracting (not her performance that was fine, it's just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate her role). In addition, the characterizations, dynamics and actions of real-life history are fascinating and unforgettable. The evolutions of the main characters and how what they experience evolve their beings are characterized exclusively by the performing artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, the rhythm remains intact throughout. The score is also great. <br /> <br /> In this predictable Hollywood movie? You bet. Thus, Mike Leigh's addicts must subtract one star, but all others must mightily enjoy.
