Stressful and quite fun sleeper about two very different siblings who are both not only called "fire triggers" (I think Stephen King's snore-fest of a book with the same name) but also forever conflicted with the another about a woman who has a bad habit of being a pyromaniac! Good special effects (especially at the end), quirky performances from a talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and strangely appropriate soundtrack make the "Wilder Napalm" a unique movie to watch ... if you can find it! On a personal note, I was lucky enough to catch him (so to speak) from the $ 2 deposit at my local video store. (*** outside of *****)
