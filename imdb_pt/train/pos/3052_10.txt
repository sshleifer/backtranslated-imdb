Strange but emotionally disturbing chiller about the middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (rent murder) run by his quietly demanding father (Donald Sutherland) upon seeing a psychiatrist (John Ritter) and flirt with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a high-level thriller that looks like "American Beauty" and "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are the highlights here. Remarkable debut for the first writer / director Henry Bromell. I'm surprised that this movie does not have the chance to stay in theaters for more than two weeks.
