Watching movie I was in very light mood and also this movie is light but the end of the movie is just unexpected, which leaves lasting memories in mind. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his profession of being a witness during the wedding with recorders. Soha comes to the wedding and her boyfriend does not, leaving Soha alone in the street she can not go home and she has nothing to live here in this situation Abahy turns out to be a helper for her, that's the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter that Abhay has to face and that keeps him on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs, the direction is good, and just like the script, you feel that the film is slow, but looking at the demand of the story, that's fine. <br /> <br /> A real watch, especially with light humor. I liked it at home with cocaine and peanut. my rating for this is 8/10
