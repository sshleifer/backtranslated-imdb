Comparable to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way never before done. The first 30 minutes build an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cross. The rest of the movie is, well, confusing, you will choose more every time you watch (I went to the movies to see 3 times now)
