Reese Witherspoon plays Dani, a young woman from the countryside who falls madly in love with her new neighbor, Court, played by Jason London. Court does everything to make Dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship unlikely. Soon Dani's nubile charm begins to earn more than Court's will. Then there's Dani's older sister's meeting, played by Emily Warfield, and the beginning of a short-term love / jealousy problem. <br /> <br /> Tess Harper and Sam Waterston complete the cast. This is a fresh and free spirit; but painful drama that touches deeply. Feel free to cry.
