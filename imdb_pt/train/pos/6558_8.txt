I do not agree with the previous review about this movie. I think it was cute and fun and it brought a good message to young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap prostitute to be cool. You can be smart, beautiful and elegant at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target audience. All in all my wife, daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I would certainly recommend it. I also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original mysteries of Nancy Drew, which I'm sure she'll love as much as I loved the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can not think of a better result for this film than rekindling interest in this classic series.
