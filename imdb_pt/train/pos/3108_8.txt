This part makes the CIA seem like a very silly organization. In fact, maybe they are. After all, the way the plot continues, it seems that a man has the power to sanction everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> Matt Damon does a very credible job. like Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the whole movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He gets help from some people and it seems that every minute of the movie, someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time for rest in this movie and the action sequences look very real. There are many chase sequences filmed with the unstable camera that in a way increase realism and make it look less Hollywood than many photos. These sequences add realism to the film in terms of feeling. <br /> <br /> The suspense in some of the sequels is brilliantly done, as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can push them away. This is the kind of action thriller you'll see when you want to have fun and I'm sure this will be the next movie in the series.
