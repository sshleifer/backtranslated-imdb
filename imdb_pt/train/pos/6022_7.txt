The often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is the political film of Antonioni, the American film of Antonioni. Stylistically, it follows the example after "Blow-Up", meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics, though certainly no less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Basically, the common mistake is that the movie glorifies the hippie generation. It's not like this. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists come from very different backgrounds. Mark of the young "rebels", Daria of a real estate agency corporation. But in true Antonioni style, both are alienated, both trying to escape from their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting of rebellious students and Black Panthers disappointed with the empty verbosity of verbosity, while Daria remains restless in movement with his car. <br /> <br /> Antionioni, the chief director, after portraying the rebellious youth as confused and superficial, then moves to the city. An environment saturated by corporatism, ads of billboards, meaningless, it has to continue expanding to accommodate similar population expansion, generating a profit at the same time. It is in this environment that the two protagonists escape, although it seems to be by coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Daria passes through a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is as suffocating as. and people like lost cases, best exemplified by an old boxing champion, now reduced to a shadow of himself, sitting drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. An impressive melancholy sequence, even more powerful with the inclusion of some half-wild children living around, brought by some "benefactor", but "destroying a genuine piece of American history." In a not so obscure symbolism, there is Antonioni's opinion about the hippies. Just a half-positive glimpse on the screen of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then there is the desert, the landscape used to devastate the effect, sometimes pure and terrifying, primitive, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two protagonists make love, "united" in fantasy by the generation "flower", reflects the similar sequence in "Red Desert", in which Giuliana tells to the son a history. It is a colorful range in a landscape without color. A lively half-fantasy in a stifling reality. <br /> <br /> The end probably belongs to the pantheon of the great finals of cinema, Western civilization is in pieces. A catharsis, an exorcism. <br /> <br /> Antionioni's two "international" films (the British "Blow-Up" and the American "Zabriskie Point") are smaller efforts than the previous masterpieces, but this is largely because cause of the faster pace and inevitably planned settings (swinging London, America's flower). But when it comes to that, of course he has not lost his advantage.
