In the early 1970s, Clifford Irving proposed writing the latest Howard Hughes biography, claiming to have spent months preparing for the book, involved in interviews with the inmate millionaire. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (though he always admitted that his findings were accurate). We advanced to 20001, several months before September 11, a book titled 'Forbidden Love' by an unknown author previously named Norma Khouri ('Lost Lost: Love and Death in Modern Day Jordan'). , a Jordanian woman who reported on death by mercy, killing her best friend Dalia, due to the fact that Dalia, being of a devout Muslim background, was dating a Christian man. This, like Irving's biography of Hughes, was revealed as a potential fraud. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski tries to delve into the quagmire that was Khouri's attempt to get rid of the lie (s). Over the course of 104 minutes, does the film try to reveal whether Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just a compulsive liar, with her own agenda / revenge? Interview with people who know her / him / her (including an ex-husband, her editor and others) tell their side of the story. This is a well-produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at so many potential culprits. Unclassified, but it contains a bad language and a staging of the terrible scene of the murder, played a few times (but nothing so blatant and disturbing as what would be seen in the latest epic of torture porn, such as Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
