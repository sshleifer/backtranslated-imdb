Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. The 1930s are a decade with many films of all kinds that I can imagine, especially during the early stages of talkies. There were films that are painfully static and monotonous, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those who just did not take a break, sometimes in a good way and sometimes not. This is one of the films that do not stop for a minute, and this is both a wonder and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street," must have been the king of the Depression-era musicals and he was probably excited about the possibilities brought to the film world as he filled that picture with him. There should not be a full minute or two without music or someone talking. It's completely crazy! I was thinking that the movie deserved a 5 (or a maximum of 6) because the pace was really bad, since it was insanely fast and sometimes I did not know what was going on and what to think. The characters just seemed to run back and forth, talking about things that did not interest me and probably no one else. I thought I would be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also climbed the female role in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose ending was the best part of it. And you know what? It was the same with "Footlight Parade"! The ending is absolutely amazing! It has become, hands down, the most impressive musical I have ever seen. The final part shows us some musical numbers and they are, believe me, something that makes watching the rest of the movie worth it. The numbers are perfect! There are three big pieces and the most impressive is certainly the second. Suddenly, the screen was full of beautiful and inventive camera work, beautiful people and simple entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
