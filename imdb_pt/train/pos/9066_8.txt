~~ I was able to watch this movie yesterday morning in an initial viewing pass ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of 2 children, ranging from 11 to 6. So I'm sure many parents can relate to having to watch many "children's" films. This was refreshing for me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know if he remained true to the book or not. But it certainly took the rudeness factor to a high level. This is the story of the "new" kid in town and it turns out there is a group of boys who have formed a kind of club and like to pick up the kids .... does it sound familiar? We all do not suffer at one time or another. He has the little brother he can not stand and the parents he is ashamed of. What I liked the most was to see how each character was totally different from the other, they all stood out. The bully (why do they always make the bully a red head?) My daughter has red hair! And she is not bully! .. lol) is quite a big bully, who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother. It took turns and more turns and well you fall in love with them all and really find yourself routing to all the characters! Even the parents, great connection between father and son. All nice, sweet, funny, gross etc ...... Take your kids !!! You'll have as much fun as them!
