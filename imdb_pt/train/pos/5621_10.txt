Submissive, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and does something huge with it. In front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable works I've had the pleasure of seeing and seeing and seeing again. It never lets me down. People, even people who know me very well, thought / thought that there was something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or should I say, devotion to "Le Locataire" They may be right, I do not know, but there is something irresistibly fascinating inside the darkness of Polanski and I did not even mention the humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that surrounds him and, of course, us, me. That building crowded by the big Oscar winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet and Lila Kedrova. For those who like movies, this is a must see. One, two, three, many, many points of view.
