As a sort of "rebuttle" of AFI's 100 best films, the British Film Institute produced a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a big fan of movies and I am proud to have seen many movies. But now I am in comparison with my idol. In this fantastic (albeit long) documentary, Scorsese traverses the viewer through several stages of American history in film. This is divided into several sections, including the Western, the movie Gangster and the Noir. Filled with lively enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide and also a fantastic teacher.
