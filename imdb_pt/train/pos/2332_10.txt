"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch" As soon as I first heard, my attention was locked in the trailer, and after the first episode I felt passionate about this show. A modern fairy tale that brings my spirits and keeps my attention throughout the show. I think Acting and Casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection. Even the only time villains manage to overflow with a single sense, from the bees man to the guy who can swallow kittens, they never disappoint me. And the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment, often end up being purely comic (like a book exploding Scratch & Sniff). <br /> <br /> Even with the sheer amount of Crime shows that we now have one day, Daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest being not only a mystery but a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a dash of Drama all roasted in a wonderful pie ..... err show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC, for years I never had a reason to turn to ABC but it brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was like pushing daisies brought the ABC back to life for me. But anyway, after two seasons, some awards, a large fan base and positive responses from critics, the show was abandoned. It seems that Ned touched ABC again and killed him forever. I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lot of talk and a lot of love from the shows they watch.
