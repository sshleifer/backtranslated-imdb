I remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I see it again and I fall madly in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating by itself. The cast just makes it so much more appealing. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this photo. She preaches Mrs. Chamberlain's mannerisms, the accent, and even looks. It shows the pain, heartache, surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it's hard to remember that IS NOT Lindy. In my opinion, this performance of Meryl was better than that of her Oscar winner in "Sophie's Choice", and should have guaranteed her her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and, for some startling reason, was not recognized by the Academy with at least one indication. In all, this movie only gets an Oscar (Streep is Best Actress). However, he received several Oscars and Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Definitely a high quality movie: tell a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast.
