The beautiful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and is really a good story. I think it would appeal to any fan of Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom, and yet it's totally unique and stands on its own. And I feel that the film adaptation of this story has a much better ending than what was featured in Neil Gaiman's original novel. I will not ruin everything for you. The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a fairy slave kept by a witch in the realm of fairies. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there's a shooting star, Tristan promises to get her back to a girl he's in love with. He does not know that the star took the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are other people behind her as well. Three old witches who want to use their heart to become young again, and some quarrelsome princes. <br /> <br /> It's a very good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful surreal and visual scenes. It is charming and I feel it can be seen by children and adults of all ages. It is simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, like I've never seen in movies since the 80's.
