Whoever invented the story is a sick person. I rented for our pajama party and all six of us got scared because we're all in one acting class together, and we met some of the actors in the class. In addition to everyone screaming all night crazy, I had weird nightmares. I kept thinking oh my God, if I get up to go to the bathroom to pee I'll be stabbed in the middle of cleaning or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we were watching this horrible horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are topless in this movie, but do not we have any of the boys' units? You should make a horror movie in which the killer is a girl and cut the units. I would watch it over and over again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I'm just giving this movie a 9 because you scared me FREAKS.
