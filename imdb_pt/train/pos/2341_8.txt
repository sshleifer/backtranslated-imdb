This is really a funny show, done in a scary way, much like a Tim Burton movie. It's worth taking a look because it's so much more creative than most of the shows this season. Best of all, it's not a "reality" show. I'm wondering why the viewing audience is so ready to accept programs like this (they have no creativity) and ignore wonderful programs like this that actually have a creative bent. <br /> <br /> While some criticize the premise, I think it's really unusual. Much nicer than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium." I think it's the funniest thing in the movie since "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the narration and the music are wonderful. If you like shows that are a bit off the beaten path, I highly recommend it. It's not as strange as the Twin Peaks, but it has a serious problem.
