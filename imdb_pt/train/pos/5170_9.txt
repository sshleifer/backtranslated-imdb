I rented this movie when it came out on videotape and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it several times since. I would have to agree with the others when they said that Indian Summer was a nostalgic movie. When I watch, I wish I could be 10 to 14 again. I think that's why we all like the movie to some degree. All of us sometimes wish that we can relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice to have all your friends / young parents again? So you do not have to worry about your job, being a parent, etc ... ??? I know I'd like to hop on a De Lorean and go back in time. Although I have enjoyed the movie a lot, my favorite camp film is the Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish they could make an Indian summer version of it.
