Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (unconsciously) remarkably well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but could not control himself superbly. I agree! What a creepy and tremendous movie. I've seen more than 2000 movies and would rate this in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients like these regularly. My only criticism was the preaching narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances, but only one in a million will behave like those 2 losers.
