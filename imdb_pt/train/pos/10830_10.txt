I liked Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen in years. A successful 70's band decides to give it another try. They start playing some shows in some European places with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are great. The characters are in place, especially the vocalist with the loud voice problems of heavy metal, makeup and personality. The concert at the end was unreal. Go and see, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
