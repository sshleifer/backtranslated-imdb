I enjoy movies like this: clever, well-crafted, entertaining, absorbing, well-acted and well-directed. No one - not even Pacino - is chewing the scene *, trying to stand out; One of the most effective moments of the film (Aielo leaning on his beloved ramp) is cooling precisely because of its containment. <br /> <br /> Not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar fabric. : involving the mind, eyes, ears and heart. Why these entertainment films so well done at the box office no one knows. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino chews on a particular scene, but precisely because it is necessary. Great scene too.
