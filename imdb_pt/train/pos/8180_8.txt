this is a fun movie. in fact, it may make him uncomfortable, since he's not a psychopath or a living dead sociopath, he's his average doctor. How scary is that. There are some good actors and actresses in this film, although some are not appreciated as Virginya Keehne as Sarah. Ken Foree, which you can recognize from Rob Zombie's Demons and Halloween (2007) co-stars as our detective on the trail of schizoid Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson). Brief summary is as follows: Dr. Alan Feinstone, a guy who has a sexy wife, a good home and is a great dentist that everyone loves. Until he picks up his wife by betraying him with the pool cleaner. Then he begins to hallucinate that the teeth of his patients are all rotting and that the female patients are his wife when he starts to go crazy in this thriller. But before that, cool guy.
