Henry Thomas was "great". Your character caught my attention. I was so "in" history that I forgot that it was not real. I wanted him to stay with the baby and see what a special person he was. The other people in the story were essential in the composition of your character. The way they came together to help each other was truly inspiring. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you in the head, where you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself.
