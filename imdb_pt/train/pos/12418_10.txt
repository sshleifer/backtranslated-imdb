This film and its sequel, Barry Mckenzie, are his, are the two biggest comedies that have already been produced. A great story that a young Australian man travels to England to claim his inheritance and to meet with his companions, who are as kind and innocent as he. <br /> <br /> It's a block filled with great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he's as dry as a dead donger donger? great characters, top acting, and has great sheilas and more Fosters consumed than three other films together. Top notch. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you've ever heard, and it's full of great celebrities. Definitely my two favorite movies of all time, I watch them at least once a fortnight.
