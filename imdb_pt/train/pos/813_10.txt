After '' Empire Strikes Back '' '' Return of the Jedi '' is my second favorite movie in the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is secretly building a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this season is fully built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star, and they need to kill many of their commanders to get the project done on schedule. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Lukes pretends to trade Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation, since he is using Han Solo as decoration piece of his palace (Han is still frozen in carbonite). Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also given to Jabba by a bounty hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han's soil and makes him remain in human form again, we see that it is actually the princess Leia in disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave, while Han is thrown out in Chewbacca's cell. <br /> Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. In his first attempt to kill Jabba, he falls into the monster cell of Jabba (Bantha), but kills him easily. Jabba gets angry and decides to play Han, Chewbacca and Luke in Sarlacc, a great desert creature that remains 1,000 years digesting its 'food'. Luke, Han and Chewie succeed in escaping again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him into Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han, Luke and Chewie, as well as C3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is very old and sick, since he is 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need any more training, but to really be a Jedi, he must fight Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's father, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice on the temptation of the dark side, and Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies, Obi Wan's spirit appears to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more a machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke is worried about killing his own father and says he feels his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and tells the reasons why Luke and Leia have been separated since infants. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Vader that he must give him Luke when he appears, since Luke is stronger than before, and both must combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side . <br /> <br /> Now let's have one of the best battles of the Star Wars series. When the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, Death Star 2, Luke will face Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie must deactivate the 'Death Star 2' power field with the help of EWOKS. (little creatures that look like little bears) <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the most exciting wars of all!
