It was really transformative, it really was !!! The man on the moon is a breathtaking experience to watch. The performance was fabulous, the story line was great, and this was a perfect start to the career of Reese Witherspoon. I do not see how anyone could not love this movie. Of course, this is not the best movie ever, even being close to it, but it was a lot of fun to watch, and I even had a big laugh with one of the jokes, and a lot of other little laughs. Of course, some have shouted your heart too, but this movie was enlightening, and brighten your day, although you have to get a little depressed from the story from time to time. I can not believe this movie has not won at least one award, and I also can not believe it has been seen by so few people on this site. Watch this movie if you did not, because it is definitely touching.
