Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he throws a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and dealers. Life sucks so he gets some kind of green office (Billy Zane) to help with the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who hurts the Anaconda. he does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the movie worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it can be a bit long - who wants to see a lot of jungle trekking, but it's good, tense action when the time is right.
