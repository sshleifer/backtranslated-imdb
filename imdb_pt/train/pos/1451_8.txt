I've seen this movie about 6 times now. And every time I see him, I get more impressed with the story and the acting. It's like watching a train crash being fired. Its subtle in its approach but very effective in reaching its goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> At the center of the story is a great dichotomy. On the one hand, we have the deputy major, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly ripping off the network of boys that forms the heart of the New York Administration and, on the other hand, we have Zappa mob boss who is deliberately trying to keep the status quo. by all means necessary. This situation culminates in the end, when Zappati orders Alselmo to ease himself, killing himself and Calhoun by ordering Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains some great one-liners. such as (a personal weakness of mine): - You do not sum up the life of a man at a time - The only new thing in this world is the story you do not know <br /> <br /> In short, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
