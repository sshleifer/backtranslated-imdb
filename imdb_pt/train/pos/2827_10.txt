This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so good! It's probably best if you do not watch waiting for an exciting plot and something fantastically clever and fun because you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it to see 50 million pots and fantastic hair from Goro / bad English, you are a real treat. The more you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a competition to identify most of the plot holes, in which case you have hours of entertainment ahead of you. I would only recommend this movie to bored or stubborn Smap fans. And yet, the latter should be a little careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a little upset about it, they thought he was selling himself. (He was not really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him.)
