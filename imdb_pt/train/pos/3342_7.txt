If you like romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the satisfying American League pennant race. On the other hand, if you're expecting Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should probably stay away. The plot contains the mandatory guy meets the girl's friends, the girl meets the guy's friends, and the guy knows the scenes of the girl's parents. There's even a guy who knows the girl's pet dog scene. That's all for the course in a movie like this. However, what I liked about it was that the plot plunged into the decision-making process that people make when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is indeed a bit quirky. The plot revolves around answering the questions; How much strangeness is too much and how much love does it take to overcome these peculiarities? It's interesting to see the characters working on it because deep down (if we admit) we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in his role and Fallon kind of surprised me - he's good too. I rate a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a fan of the Yankees.
