The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the best known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's characteristics: dangerous women, the game of trust and characters that are not as obscure as others suspect. be, or not so harmless. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is superb as a lifelong ex-boxer of the sport due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses the RAGING BULL-esquire sequences for background story) and much Little View Rachel Ward also delivers great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet tinkering Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this movie, so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void.
