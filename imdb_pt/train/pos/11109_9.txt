The Sopranos stand out as a dynamic and hermetic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. In defining the story in the middle of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, down to the ground and definitive means the deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents one facet of American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies hard work in difficulty, torn between family duty and the need to keep his "business" in balance. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps history moving forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect the loyal subalterns - but selfish present in all endeavors, who are entrusted by necessity and not by merit. With Ralph's character, Joe Pantoliano rehearses a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a distorted businessman who blossoms with violence are tragically compensated for by his impressive spending power. And Dominic Chianese is the supreme symbol of the old-fashioned old guard, who maintains power through established relationships and the need of those who are out to divert the guilt. <br /> <br /> Although abrasive and occasionally disturbing, The Sopranos has earned its place as the final TV drama. <br /> <br /> PS A good addition to the Chase series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest characters interesting.
