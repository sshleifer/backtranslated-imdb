After the initial shock of noticing Mr. Branagh's courage in filming it, I was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic right in front of me. I was not dissapointed. So loyal to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. This surprised me. I always like to see, or rather to hear, Branagh and this made me think ... this movie is nicknamed in other countries? That would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
