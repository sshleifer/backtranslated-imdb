This murder mystery with musical numbers is long in atmosphere and character but rather short in suspense and plausibility. Based on a stage play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, he combines a whodunit plot with a backstage environment (a murder investigation takes place the opening night at the theater where a music magazine is being staged). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and varied: hardcore Victor McLaglen as the police officer who leads the investigation and never ceases to idiotically ridicule whatever showgirl is in sight; Jack Oakie (the pre-war Jack Lemmon? Or Jack Lemmon, Jack Oakie's post-war?) As the tormented director, he must coordinate the staged appearance as well as the chaos behind the scenes; the always homemade Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe lover with deep and dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has an impressive close-up monologue near the end, as the shaky maid madly in love with the male lead; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as that very masculine leader, making the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operatively delivering "Where They Come From and Where They Go" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who broke away from us too soon, like a stingy dancer whose love for Brisson is rejected; the normally ridiculous Toby Wing, which here at least is the center of a running-laughing joke. <br /> <br /> When the complications of the plot get out of hand, there is always an interesting artist or a fun and melodious musical number to distract the viewer. The most celebrated sequence of the film is the number "Marauana", led by Michaels, but, besides its controversial history, is really one of the smaller musical offerings. All of the songs here are staged as if they could fit into a standard proscenium theater space, as opposed to the Busby Berkeley style cinematic fantasy setting.
