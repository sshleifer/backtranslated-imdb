I agree with everyone who says this series was the best of the "spy" genre. My husband and I were captivated when it first aired in the US and we watched every episode. I tried at that time to buy the series (I did tape everything), but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even thought of writing to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like the others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot). If the original version is already available on DVD, I'll be among the first in line to buy a copy. Ian Holm's portrait of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was incredible. (He's always amazing.)
