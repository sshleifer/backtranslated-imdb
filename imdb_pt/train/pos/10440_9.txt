This movie is clever. That is, more than most other films, it transcends the lowest common denominator - stupid people probably will not appreciate it. The story also depends a lot on the dialogue. There are some parallels with Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply much better. <br /> <br /> The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere seem totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliant. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and acting melted it perfectly together. <br /> <br /> The dialogue moves on very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little overdone. However, he is on the right side almost all the time, although I found some moments a little strange and embarrassing. Balancing yourself in this fine line requires incredibly talented actors. Sometimes it produces great results, and overall this movie is just great! Only very, very rarely is "love" in films portrayed in a way that I consider to be reliable and realistic. Every time this is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and seemingly timeless beauty of the leading female actress has helped a lot in this regard. She still looks impressive in this movie 12 years later. <br /> <br /> This is simply a gem of a movie that you can not miss. One of the best movies I've seen since the 90's!
