I thought this was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more in the film about the two sisters knowing that each one liked the same boy before being killed. I'm sure if the film had been made that way, there would have been a very different ending, so this movie was so good. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings you can always get over and that if two sisters deal with a boy (the same boy) working with pain and heartache makes things look better and easier for work between the two of them. It's good to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still manage to become even closer after your end. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it now when it happens. I seem to see myself watching every time it happens. It would have been nice if there had been a 2nd part to this movie, maybe having the older sister to come and have your baby, this would have really made a great end to the story since he died in this way would keep him alive even that he is dead.
