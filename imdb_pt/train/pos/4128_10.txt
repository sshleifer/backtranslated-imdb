With all the violence on TV and in the local news, it's exciting to have a program that does not have violence or adult language, but is still fun. My children are looking forward to seeing us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all like Elton Brown. We like to learn about the background of the main ingredient, vegetables and unique seasonings. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a great hour of entertainment as well as informative. Best of all in our hectic life, it's an hour the family goes by.
