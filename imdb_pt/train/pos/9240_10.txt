I found this movie in a videostore, it cost $ 2 to buy. The whole movie stinks very badly! The so-called colonel, who would be the hero here if the cover could be trusted, should be in his eighties and barely able to walk. He, however, can film some of the world's dumbest ninjas. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense, given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning, now two scary eighty-looking faces assume, in what must have been some kind of story. I got lost a hundred times, but I did not care because the movie is so bad that it's so much fun to watch. Zero-Budget Trash with actors who do not deserve this name. Go take a look!
