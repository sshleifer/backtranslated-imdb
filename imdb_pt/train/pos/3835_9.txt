This movie is incredible - it's like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark decorations, the insects that swarm everywhere, the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It seems a bit to David Lynch's films: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire has almost no plot. It is more a succession of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. That is a disadvantage. If the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating ending, I'd give it a 10 out of 10. But that's missing, and that's why I gave the movie a 8. Nuit Noire is a movie worth watching . Search for this DVD and you will be rewarded!
