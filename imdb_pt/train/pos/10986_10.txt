We stumbled upon the documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and were "sucked" without warning. Everyone in the room was paralyzed on television and in the scary images of Edith and Edie, who seemed to be living in virtually a room in an immense mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and ears of corn (which was cooked on the bedside table ) - and the cat urinating on Edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "I struggle with it [the smell]". We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get into the position they were. Lovely! a must see !!!!
