If you are not a beginner in the world of Gundam, this is a good place to start. If you're exhausted in Star Wars or Star Trek, here's a compelling and realistic science fiction series on which you can dive. Not the simplistic robot story that saves the world on a giant you might have expected but rather complex and emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "good" and the "bad" is decidedly less than distinct. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, naive boy who lives in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming of Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. During the course of this series, Al befriends an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns some difficult lessons about the reality of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series, with its cool designs of wicks, involving history and friendly characters. I recommend this series for those who like realistic SF anime, or for those who think that anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.
