"Condemned" is much more a type of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that takes place within it comes from the long slowing period of a late Southern day. And, by extension, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, the two worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful," a film that seems almost full of action compared to this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, it's just a little on this side. The slow pace leaves plenty of room for director of photography Toyomichi Kurita, who infuses the film with the right feel of fragile light and heat. <br /> <br /> Because this is essentially a play filmed, with little in terms of editing or directing dexterity, it all comes to acting. As far as I'm concerned, there are no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born January 1931), create characters who are totally real, disinterested in anything but living. Lukas Haas, a young actor I knew from "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character very much like his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, a little scared and sad, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Maybe a title like "Condemn" is a disservice to this movie. This title, along with the opening scene, seems to create an image of a much more tense Western-type image. If slow-paced theatrical productions do not interest you very much, you will also want to pass this. Otherwise, this may be exactly the movie you would like them to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
