The film is very realistic. Absolutely, it does not belong to the genre Hollywood Cinema, where each line must be pronounced in a perfect way and where every movement is necessary. The actors who play the lovers 'roles do a BIG job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their adventures in everyday life. Overall, the film culminates the viewer to a depressed state. This is where the realism of the whole story is apparent. Not everything happens the way we think it should happen. I can say that the movie does not end on a bad note. We watch, we learn, we experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
