A sophisticated contemporary fable about the tensions that work to loosen up and, finally, untie the vows of marriage. The main thrust of the narrative comes from a "homily" uttered by a country priest after the marriage vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of marriage is made explicit, which is gradually stripped of the tensions of modern life . The "moral" of this story within a story is that for a marriage to work, both now and in the past, it was necessary for this relationship to be supported by family and friends. This film was a blockbuster relative by Italian domestic standards. It's a pity that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
