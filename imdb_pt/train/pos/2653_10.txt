Kubrick proved his brilliance again, now in a suspense-horror movie based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a forty-year-old man, married, with a son and a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paying job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about solitude in this potentially dangerous winter spot, and told him that some janitor in the past had gone crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, their son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who lights up the future (shinning), knew that the place was not good and did not want to go. As soon as they set up at the hotel, things started well, but within a month, Jack began to act strangely, annoyed and depressed. At this point, we know that something will happen, but we do not know when and how. Terrifying things happen, like the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good to them, as if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic guard, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. Obeying that order, Jack went to the goal and many of the scariest things I've ever seen happened here. The finale is spectacular and spectators will be interested and shocked until the last minute.
