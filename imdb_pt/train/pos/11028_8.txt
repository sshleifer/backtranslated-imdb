To be honest, I did not really like this movie when I first saw it. But I think the problem is that I did not see it in a theater. Big mistake ! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is the cinematography. Try watching this movie on the largest possible TV and a great sound system. The music is good and puts the movie on a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movies. This guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss goodbye, etc. And it's particularly good in this movie. The special effect is great and spectacular. Stallone really needed the film to come back successfully. It's still good to see you!
