I remember having a very low regard for a venture like this when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a child actress and a kitschy title in a John Hughes formula. You could not have paid me to see this 15 years ago. But I got caught watching while I lost a Sunday afternoon, and it hits me on some levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, Reverse part Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like Kelly Lynch's escapism. Above all, it gently pulls out some very nice strings. It's very difficult not to fall into history, develop a crush on Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike the tough boyfriend, and laugh at Curley Sue's ranks. It has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
