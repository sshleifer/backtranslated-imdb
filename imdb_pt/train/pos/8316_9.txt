I watched this movie every chance I had, back in the seventies, when it came out on cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which fascinated me (and Bill Clinton) ever since. I was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me. It was great to see a movie about other girls growing up, trying to decide who they'd like to be and making some bad and good choices. I was dazzled by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the wonderful dresses they ended up wearing and the moody dialogue. As someone being raised by a single mom too, I really could identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem almost more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
