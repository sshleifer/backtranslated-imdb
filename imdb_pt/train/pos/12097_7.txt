This complicated story begins quite simply, with an English journalist accepting a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend a night in Blackwood's haunted castle. Once there, the writer wanders through the dusty halls and corridors until the music and glimpse of a waltz couple take him to an empty room. He sits on the stud and starts playing the music he heard, and is surprised to be touched by the handsome Elizabeth Blackwood on the shoulder. She informs him in an ambiguous and charming way that she has prepared her room upstairs and that someone is always expected tonight ... the Night of the Dead. So begins an amazing series of supernatural events that confuse the journalist throughout the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: Probably will not surprise many viewers by knowing that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. That does not stop her from falling in love with the journalist, but it makes things more complicated for them than for the average couple. This is a fun movie with absolutely everything: ghosts, scary castle, repeated views of past events, sex and violence (although both have been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) catchy is the main reason to see this. She has a strange charisma, unlike any other person you've ever seen in the movies. Recommended!
