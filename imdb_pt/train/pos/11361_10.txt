Although I've seen this movie years ago, its impact never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of an invader is profound and moving. His anguish at not being able to prevent the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is incredible of Sutherland, who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts, for the problematic citizen x. Every day, when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think of this film and the exhausting work that people do that try to find the killers.
