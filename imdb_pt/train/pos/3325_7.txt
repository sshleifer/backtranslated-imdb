OK, I usually did not watch a movie from the Farrelly brothers. I do not remember seeing one. I also do not remember watching a Jimmy Fallon movie. All right, I watched the taxi, but I said penance and I was forgiven for that mistake. But this movie had Drew Barrymore and I think she's the cutest thing. I do not know what it is about her, but I just smile the whole time I'm looking at her. She just captivates me like that. I mean, I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates. That sad? This was not the biggest baseball movie - it should not be. It was a love story about a sad puppy clinging to the one thing that never disappointed him until he found something worth giving up. It had a predictable end, but there was so much going on that was worth it.
