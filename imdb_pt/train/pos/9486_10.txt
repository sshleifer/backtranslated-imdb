Finally, a thriller that omits the car chases, explosions and other attractive effects. The film combines a simple storyline (murder of a French president) with an excellent background. One must take a look behind the man's behavior with the authorities and explain why we would obey almost every order (even murder) that would be given to us. <br /> <br /> In addition, it shows us how the secret services can handle the race. history and how hardly can they be controlled. The best thing in this movie is that there is a classic "end of Hollywood" that can be easily predicted.
