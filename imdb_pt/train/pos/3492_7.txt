It's not as bad a movie as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> You have a good cast. It's good to see Roger Moore back onscreen, as well as the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. Maybe starring alongside his cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo. <br /> <br /> Also a good use of invisible places like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> I hope to see more co-productions in the UK and Europe like this.
