This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and the laughter of the audience members support me. Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), laughter was so spontaneous and intense. He easily has intricate like Mr. and Mrs. Smith from last year (2005) in his parody use (espionage on Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex on My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Director Ivan Reitman's balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and completely ridiculous, is great. Never the shock and dramatic bass break the rule of comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements, even if the ending is transmitted in advance. In some ways, it is so obvious that it is great to see how this happens. Just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that you can not really see it. Easily eight out of ten stars ranked up there with Tootsie (1982). Possibly a nine (depends on how it appears in a second preview).
