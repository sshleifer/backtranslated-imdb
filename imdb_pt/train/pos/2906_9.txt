A hilarious action comedy in which Damian Szifron leads to the lives of Diaz, a policeman whose wife betrayed him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty for his wife's infidelity, falling into depression, he stops worrying, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a parachute-cornered Jew, a liberal leftist who does not trust police. He is said to accompany Diaz in his daily chores, unable to refuse due to the terms of his parole. Soon the situation returns when Silberman himself discovers that his wife is betraying him, and ends up being comforted by the same person that he should help, a person whom he did not trust in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Strange characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
