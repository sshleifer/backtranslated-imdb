I got a free pass for a preview of this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of superficial and fun humor of virgin. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard that I cried at some of the jokes. This movie is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly distorted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) raw, and the talk about sex is as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What is surprising, however, is that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is fantastic, but (like The Office) the supporting cast really does make the movie work. All characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and sympathy. Everyone is gaining weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm sure you'll be there at Office Space for replays and quotable lines.
