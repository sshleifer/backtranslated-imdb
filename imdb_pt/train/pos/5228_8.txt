I found this movie hilarious. The spoofs in other popular movies of the time were some of the funniest I've ever seen in this kind of movie. Give it a chance. If you've seen the movies that this movie is faking, and you get the mood, you should like the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie. (this is not a spoiler because I will not tell you what actually happens) it was a scene with the "flashy thingy" of the MIB. When they first discover the device and do not know what it does ... and then again in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie is that I could never find it on DVD to buy a copy.
