Since I first saw the theater, it has been my favorite. Since then, I have seen it countless times and I never tire of it. The setting has a lot to do with it (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the plot is original and I liked how he used the people of the small mountain town like the heroes. There was not a movie that I can compare that too. John Lithgow plays a clever villain, but I love how he's completely out of his element - he has to follow Tucker around and that's what keeps him interesting. This is an action movie at its best. I do not think I'll see another one that is so much fun. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 dismissed shots to qualify as an action movie. You just have to keep it captivated, not in shock.
