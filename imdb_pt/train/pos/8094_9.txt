Firstly, no adaptation is as good as the book, especially when you are dealing with a master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION beautifully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with psychedelia from the 1970s, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes - animation and background painting are sometimes a bit "rough" in their technical execution, but it is beautiful, however, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. In addition to absolute exclusivity in images, there is absolutely extraordinary voice performance - a performance that is SUPERIOR to acting in the new live action movies. And while cellular animation may not be the most "technically proficient" animation, it captures superbly the expressive body and facial gestures of acting, while at the same time not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings range from traditional "fantasy" motifs to direct abstraction, but the transition to abstract scenarios is always motivated by narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you are a person who has to have an extensive computer rendering in a movie so that everything is viewed for you then I can see how you may not like this movie but if you like top acting, transcendental images and JRR Tolkien , this movie must be seen.
