If you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen.i movie think it's up there with pranks / love book / high school USA / scream / calender girl / crybaby / all great movies set in the lat 50s & early 60s and has a wonderful soundtrack.Not like many songs like in some of these types of movies but still great.it's all very funny at times and has a great love interest.all the young cast are great. I want there were the most kind of these wonderful films. My favorite movie of all time is back to the future, when Marty McFly returns to 1955 well in those wonderful films that sits in the 50's (early 60's) there are some movies better than this, but not many.
