There have been very few mainstream movies in postcolonial Africa, and those that have a mixed bag. The latter, with its altruistic pretensions of exposing slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values ​​in Africa, which prove to be not very different from the values ​​of humanity as a whole. It also has deficiencies, given the undue influence of the Western preconceptions of Africans and especially of the Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, the beautiful African-American wife of the English physician David Linderby, is captured by Arab slave traders, along with a Sanufu teenager and a boy. The main slave trader, Suleiman, is the Arabian stage, with its flowery and sometimes funny rhetoric, and gestures to match - which would not be out of place in "Carry On Follow That Camel," but it's not the standard movie deserves . Peter Ustinov, of course, had more than enough skills to deal with some of the shortcomings of the script, and he rescued what might have been a pitiful one-dimensional character. Continuing the stereotyped theme, all three Suleiman's Arab officials are unintelligent and have pedophile tendencies toward the boy, who fortunately are not portrayed onscreen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first ports of call is the local police officer, a pompous and incompetent stereotype of Africa. bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotyped white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on crossbred relationships, who initially refuses to help unless David makes the payment in advance. Conquered by David's love for Anansa and conscious of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take David in his helicopter to help search for Anansa. They find Suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them in neighboring territory - as a result of Sandell's hesitation and David's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down, but David survives. <br /> <br /> Then we see David being introduced to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who lost his family to Suleiman and is now moved only by revenge. They find the girl Sanufu with a group of Tuareg and know that they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most moving scenes they kill a group of slave traders only to discover that it was not Suleiman's group, and has no choice but to send their prisoners to the Tuaregs they knew the most early. Later we discovered that the boy who had been raped is a sorcerer and, in an excellent scene with supernatural tones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's henchmen. Anansa on his part - and despite the boy's skepticism - manages to plan the death of Suleiman's two other employees. <br /> <br /> By this time, Suleiman and his slaves are only a few days away from the slave market. Suleiman, now no doubt that Anansa is a "problem", tries to sell her to an obscenely rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. Upon discovering that Anansa is an American who works for the UN, the prince decides, recklessly, to continue the bargain without regard to the consequences. The scene where the two men bargain is one of the best in the movie. In the slave market, the boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and we find out if The boy will still be considered "wunderbar" when his owner is receiving his wizarding skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bittersweet end from Malik's point of view. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, David and Anansa are reunited, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself for having seen the task that he has completed. <br /> <br /> The overall plot of the movie is excellent, but it loses marks for its stereotyped portrait of almost all the main characters. The credit should go to all the major players to address many of the shortcomings of the script.
