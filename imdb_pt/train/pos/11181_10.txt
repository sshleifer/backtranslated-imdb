This is one of the most creepy, scary, and most moving horror films of all time! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family moving into new home with his wife (Rachel), Daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). It all seems normal until Dr. Creed misses a patient who had a terrible head injury, Then he is haunted by the ghost known as Victor takes him to the Sematarty Pet and show him where the dead come to life. <br /> Louis did not know if this was all dream and it is talking to Ellie who cared about her cat that could be killed by truck and later Rachel told Louis that it was really difficult to talk about death because of his sister Zelda that he was really sick (as we see in a flashback he really was and this is one of the scariest scenes ever!) <br /> <br /> The next day, Louis gets a phone call from Jed saying there was a cat killed by truck and Jed take him to where Victor, the ghost said he did not go! And burying the cat, his wife and children will see his grandparents and Louise is alone at home shocked to see the cat is back and now is so bad in his eyes, then he will see Jed, then Jed say that he too buried his dog there too (As we saw another flashback). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie The Family picnicking, Gage is playing with the kite and Gage says I drop it, "the wind blows the stick near the road where a truck is coming fast, Gage is sitting approaching the road, Louis is rushing to catch him, Most of the scene in any horror movie will come out with his jaw on the ground or shivers will go down his back when you hear Louis scream Soon he misses him so much that Louis buries Gage in the same place where the cat is buried.The most scary thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible and the performance of everyone was great 10 out 10
