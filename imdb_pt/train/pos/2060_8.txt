This movie is not your typical horror movie. There are some exaggerated humor and death scenes that can be comic. I personally enjoyed the movie because of its off-beat humor. It's definitely not a super scary movie, which is fine if you do not want to be scared and paranoid later. I liked the performance of the hick and Lester ... very believable. I think I'm going to paint my hair red like that Scarecrow girl - pretty cool! Either way, it's worth renting for the extravagant humor and non-typical horror experience.
