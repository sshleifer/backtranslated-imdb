I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this movie hit Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969. After seeing this, however, I'm no longer surprised. He was way ahead of his time in terms of his style, cinematography, and flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short movie. I think Voight captured the naivety and the evil when provoked. The two scenes that really got me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man asks for it. I think when he looks in the mirror, he's trying to see if it's really him who's done or is about to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision for Hoffman to take on that role. . Otherwise, it may have been typecast after the graduate. Anyway, this is considered a great one for a reason.
