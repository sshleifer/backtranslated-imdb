The Jox robot does not suffer from bad stories or effects. I mean, that was 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used stop animation, as most movies did in the 1980s. If you watched your biggest blockbusters during this time, most of them did their best with the special effects shots that were available at the time. It was not until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was accomplished, and pensioners in history began to use this motive. But you will have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing and even Power Rangers if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very menacing. This makes you not want to face the man without a good support plan. And there are some great moments within this movie. A traitor / spy is working within his means. Whoever you think is on your side, supporting you all the way, may be the person you did not expect him to be. And this is very problematic to think so, do not you agree?
