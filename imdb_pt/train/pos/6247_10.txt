Trailers from this movie may show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are only rare fragments, chosen to attract audiences. They are, of course, showing the main message of the film: People who constantly kick their heads into their jobs and lives, using power, they may have elsewhere, to notoriously oppress others. And at the lower end of the chain of oppression, especially women. <br /> <br /> A movie that shows it as brutally as Hundstage is certainly difficult to face, but having to endure those lives is even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very much like Short Cuts, but consisting of documentary-style episodes, featuring people as their neighbors, playing just the way they are. Without any brilliance, and more disturbingly, without any hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because you realize, these people are out there, and there are many of them, even though our society focuses on the beautiful outside looks. Somewhere that the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere undeclared domestic violence has to happen, somewhere the hopes have to shatter. I certainly know these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie without funny scenes (some may think that the poor woman repeating the ten supermarkets is funny, but this is actually happening) and without melodrama, go watch this movie. However, it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles that I fear, as subtitles can not carry the accent.
