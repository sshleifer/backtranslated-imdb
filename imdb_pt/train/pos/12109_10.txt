Yaitate !! Japan is a very fun show and I really like it! It was shown in our country recently on Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It is about Azuma Kazuma who is trying to realize his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He is working on the branch of Pantasia in the south of Toyo and is also helping his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to defeat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They struggle with other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn how to make different kinds of bread but also learn how to cook other foods. It's a very funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must see for people of different ages.
