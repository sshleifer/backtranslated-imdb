Where ends the sidewalk (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototype of film noir and as such, quite flawless, both style and content . View. The settings of photography and the night are first-rate (director of photography Joseph LaShelle lets drama drain from scene to scene), and close-ups on the face express pure expressionism. I can watch this kind of movie just for the visual, even when the actors fight and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But acting is first-rate here, and the plot shows what I consider to be the core of most noir films, the alienated male leader (representing the many men coming home after the war and feeling lost). In fact, Dana Andrews is not only really convincing as the solitary and disturbed detective, but also has a small but important counterpart in the film, the woman's first husband, a former soldier decorated in tough times and alcohol. The fact that one man kill the other can be of monumental significance in general - the normal guy struggling with his inner problems for success, while the soldier wearing medals slips to an accidental death with a silver plaque on his head. The woman moves from one to the other - we assume that they marry and have children, as previously suggested in the film. Even if this is pushing an interpretation for him after the fact, we can still see the path of a man with some psychological baggage creeping through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order - turning into a small crime right on the spot he really got along with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more restrained and touching type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story, made only a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You can easily see the two films side by side for a comparison session and textbook contrast. The fact that Andrews, as Detective Dixon, is morally struggling with all this, and Douglas, as Detective McLeod is not, can explain why one man gets his girlfriend and the other does not. Gene Tierney takes an extremely nice, unfriendly, and ultimately conventional, "handsome" type of woman - not just a desirable cardboard, but someone you want Dixon to marry for real. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is actually secondary to the main drama, but it is quite effective in its play with types and clich√©s. The small parts are kept in a hurry, the small details (like the portable data table) are good touches, away from the character actors or the glamor of the game in Casablanca. But Curtiz's great film is iconic even in the details - it makes no effort to be subtle, real and penetrating, but on the contrary, it's swept, memorable and inspiring. They come at opposite ends of the war and represent opposing possibilities for their leaders. Bogart is beginning his active duty, Dixon and the man Dixon killed are everywhere. Through, completely, but not washed. <br /> <br /> It is not by chance that many, possibly most, noirs have what you would call "happy" endings. Man overcomes his opponents and transforms his inner self, and the viewer, then and now, understands how beautiful this must be.
