I really liked this, and although the ending made me angry, I still gave him 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are heading to Florida, in the way they know 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really do not add anything to the plot, but they are at least somewhat enjoyable. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for fun, but they have trouble with the car and they never get it. One of the girls decides to go to a gas station nearby to ask for help, the other three are next to the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, be in the middle of nowhere she has. No choice but to go in the bushes. Soon she witnesses how a man (March) strangles a woman, terrified the girl runs away from the area, she does not get very far, but she gets lost. <br /> <br /> Her car friends will look for her, they also enter the forest and run to the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls' heads, the other girl runs away , manages to return to the car where she is also dead. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the two remaining girls meet and, due to entering the gas station, are arrested. That's when I started getting angry, these poor girls fear for their lives and the hulking cops do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are mistreated and one of them is left alone for the crazy to kill her in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without entering dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This film has nudity, good actresses, a bath scene imitating psychosis, graphic violence against women and a solid history. Some women will probably find that offensive and sensitive individuals will NOT like the ending, but most of all, this is a great unknown film.
