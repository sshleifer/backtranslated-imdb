Very good martial arts movie and Jet Li is the best since the very master Bruce Lee. Li is excellent as the low key / police librarian who saves everything time and time again. He has a presence and a look that is fascinating and believable as the king of kung fu that you do not play with. Fran√ßoise Yip is simply beautiful in this original mixed race mode that is unique because of her mixed heritage, she has an innocence and a fascination at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with sunglasses and long hair was also very good, but I can not find his name on the credits, can anyone help me with this? Thank you ! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask in any language your good entertainment!
