Yes, some tangles are a bit difficult to follow, and The Bill has a tendency to get violent, but in fact it's a captivating spectacle, which I try not to lose. The vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and fairly tense, and the acting is pretty good, though I miss Roberta Taylor like Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I admit, I prefer the older episodes for the more recent episodes, and it's a bit of a shame the show is now past the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8:00. Still, because I like The Bill it's because it's not only engaging, but the cliffhangers in the end make the next episode a must-see. It is true, however, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
