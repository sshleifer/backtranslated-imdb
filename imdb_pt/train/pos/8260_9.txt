Those Frenchmen and Germans certainly have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that the Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in the translation occurs in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler besieged Germany and began his plans to conquer the world, with France being a victim of his ambitions. But these are times of serenity compared to the future. A group of miners on the border tries to cross to France to get work. They are rejected back and then into a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then there is a disaster in the mines of the French and a well worked and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story, is not it? Pabst was a silent movie poet and I'm not sure if this is his first sound film or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He is not picky, but brings a robust realism to the ordeal. Ther is still a flashback to a WWII event waving the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the film makes the events with pride and objectivity. Sometimes, this is how a movie needs to be.
