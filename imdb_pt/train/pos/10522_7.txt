This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is inventive, crossing borders with artifice, but it certainly avoids the trap of making it look like a boring TV soap, since the whole story is directed by dialogues. <br /> <br /> The acting is competent. Ms Paltrow is indifferent, as her character demands, but the required distance of the other characters is accompanied by a far less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care about the results of her gaming efforts. Some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - much in style that is enjoyed on stage but out of place in movies. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - not his fault, except for leaving an impression as a gay streetcar in "The High Life" that it is now difficult to accept him doing any serious role. . Performance honors go to Toni Collette, who can radiate heat, and Jeremy Northam, who throws his character at the right level.
