What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to keep stuck to at the beginning is our desire to know if Martinaud did the dirty action. Without ruining it so much, of course there is a red herring and a twist. But then we find that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and her difficulty in dealing with it. When there is revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because, as history progresses, we are led to think that he is the sick and perverted pedophile we are predisposed to have in mind. One of these things he has to face is the distant distance he and his wife have, though they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, are delivered to the shocking final outcome of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie demands your patience and certainly tempted the restless teenagers sitting in the rear. They were obviously cursing because they are not partial to "central location" movies. Although there is a little trip, when we get to the woods and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as smart as we are made to think he is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
