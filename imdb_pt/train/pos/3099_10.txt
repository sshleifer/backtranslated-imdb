Along with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my new favorite dramas of the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> Great cast all but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the back photog) and Hope Davis (the recent widow of a journalist killed in Iraq). Besides the performance, the writing was recent and the performance superb. The show was also filmed in New York City, the real city, not the Warner Bros., or the backlot of some other studio, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and another rubbish of reality. Too bad it did not last.
