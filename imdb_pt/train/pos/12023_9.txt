A change in vision is necessary to appreciate modern British films, which somehow allow them to be seen by themselves and by their own qualities, not by the criteria that American films are judged. Britfilm has to strive to be tough and find it difficult to do so, but with enthusiasm British films can dominate its overwhelming competitor. <br /> <br /> This film does not fail in its content, but only in sticking to itself. to the predecessor, thus allowing everything to be easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their moorings. It's a couple of decades later, teaching Gregory and this time with two girls in his mind. He teaches at his school protesting against human rights abuses. When students are laid off, they find abuse in their midst, it must face if it is just a conversation. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive movie in which there is not the usual mundane character of any American movie you expect to make. it does, but a naive boy who can still put everything in line for the basics. Perhaps. Certainly it is no protest by numbers, being very hot. Where American film may seem realistic because it is urban and bold, this and other British films of recent years - those who do not try to match America with visceral emotions - are real because British humor reveals truths.
