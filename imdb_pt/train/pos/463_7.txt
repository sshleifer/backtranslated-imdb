Of course the plot, the script and especially the cast are strong in the film. So many good things to see. One aspect that I especially liked is the idea of ​​the antagonist - Luzhini's former mentor (Turturro) - working his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent - a three-piece Italian dandy and reed - turns out to be a real gentleman and an excellent chess player. To his credit, the "adversary" nobly follows the plan at the end to complete the final game of the championship posthumously (Lujin drew a pamphlet from a window - sad, but so liberating to him) through unstable genius. In his death, then, because of the bravery of an honest master of chess, Lujin's defense (which he developed in a late moment of lucidity) can be played. The Italian gent praises the piece and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "ultimate game"!
