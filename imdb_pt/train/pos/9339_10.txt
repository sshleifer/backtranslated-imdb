For those of you who do not make that reference, clubberin was 4 fists hitting a body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, for review. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments happened on this stage. I remember watching Steve Steve, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his work days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I'd be here as long as listing all The point is that WCW had an incredible list in the pre-Hogan days and they were producing a fun television. Dusty Rhodes commenting in his later years gave me a new reason to watch when I started smoking marijuana as a teenager ... I really wish Vince would put him on the microphone for a show or two, maybe on the next Great American Bash. ? They CLUBBERIN! Here comes THE PLUNDA! He was great. -DirrTy
