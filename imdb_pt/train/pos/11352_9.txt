This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the first serial killer known to the Soviet Union. I had tuned in, just waiting for a decent TV movie, but I was drawn to the convincing way the story was told. As others have said, there is much to admire here that unfortunately is lacking in many screen launches. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit goes to Chris Gerolmo, whose clever script and direction draws the viewer until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. The acting of the whole cast is also superb, especially the two protagonists, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. His compelling portraits give his characters' bows great credibility, and the scene in which they have their first committee meeting after Perestroika is actually playing. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your police films with a little more depth and a little less, I strongly recommend that you look for the "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
