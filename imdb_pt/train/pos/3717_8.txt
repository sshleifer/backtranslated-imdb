It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just a beautiful feeling and yet never lowering yourself to be sentimental. There is fantastic cinematography and the protagonist is brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of time. You have a real heart for it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I, at least, am looking at his next project. Tracking is always the hardest thing. It's like the second blues album for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope your next movie is not something lame like a shark movie. Congratulations to all. Enjoy your movie.
