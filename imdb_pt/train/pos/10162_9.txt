Oh, I loved this movie. I think it had everything. It made me laugh out loud more than a dozen times. Yeah, I'm a girl, so I'm writing this from a girl's perspective. I think it's a shame that only scored 5.2 in the standings. Many guys voting? It was way above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman I do not like all the fancy movies, on the contrary I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they should be. But like I said, this movie had everything, almost in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, good acting. Although the character of Eva Longoria Parker reminded much of Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives, but so what? It was amazing. I'm going to keep this movie for rainy days, days when I feel low and need some laughs.
