I loved that this movie recognizes the spectator's intelligence by allowing the layers to detach themselves from the characters through their mutual interactions about the unsaid loss that so affected each of them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is beautiful, and it is a reflection inspired by the vision of someone I believe to be an extremely talented filmmaker with the maturity and artistic vision to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to realize. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who had the ability to focus on a goal and stick to it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
