This is just another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and starred in this terrible mystery. No one could have done better. The suspense was palpable everywhere. I'd like Mr. Wilder to thank us for another one of those. I appreciated everything I've seen in Mr. Wilder, but I had no idea how talented he was until I saw "Murder in a Small Town," and the next. He really has a firm grasp on what the audience wants and how to deliver it in his writing and of course in his brilliant acting. His subtle wit comes in swords. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and / or Gene Wilder's work. Your star gets brighter and brighter.
