I just got back from the premiere of Montreal on Zero Day ... and I'm surprised how the hell I find a negative comment about the movie. Basically, it's Coccio's fault to make an easy and overblown social message ... well, Mr.-I-am-reviewer, it's an easy and over-the-top critic of movies with a social burden. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a school similar to the one these guys go to. Discard and ignorance in the menu. The thing is ... I understand how young children can be brought to make such horror. High schools have become battlefields of compliance. It's a very ugly sight. You need to fight to be like the others. It's hard to explain, but many people do not realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in a comfortable suburb is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real reason for the movie is not about what's driving them. It's about that peaceful suburb like death and everyone closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect city. Cal expressed well. It's an alert. The drama is everywhere and can take all forms. In that case, little dramas (like Andre being called a fagot for wearing a J.C Penny shirt) are becoming the worst nightmare of a whole city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme path to express their pain. The discomfort of disagreement at a time when you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of Andre & Cal as if with the pain they communicated, Cal and Andre communicated their blind anger to their community, their refusal to think about the causes of some acts. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating. What Andre & Cal is living is a reality ... and scary, it can reach out to other kids. <br /> <br /> Disturbing film ... Making home and feeling strong has made Ben Coccio make a very disturbing film.
