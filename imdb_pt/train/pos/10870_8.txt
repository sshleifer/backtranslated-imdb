Personally, I think the film is a good watch. He describes the actual situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how the triads are organized. <br /> <br /> In addition, it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police will not just go out and end the triads. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is quite violent due to the methods of murders and torture. However, the film remains true to the real world, so the violence on the screen is just a reflection of what really happens. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any fan of Triad / Mafia movies. Another good watch would be the Dragon Squad. This movie has more guns than this, since in this movie there are more knives than weapons (in fact, I do not remember seeing a single weapon).
