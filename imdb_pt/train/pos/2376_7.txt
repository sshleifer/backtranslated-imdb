Everyone who reviewed this movie, and probably many professional movie reviewers, just does not understand. This film was made with sequences of mats and art techniques, as well as the works of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you take any of Zeman's films, such as The Fabulous World by Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time or No Comet. If you can not find a movie, read the comments on the AMG. They will explain the processes used. If anyone looked at Zeman's work and tried to compare it to any other science fiction film of the time, the viewers probably would not have understood it either. It is unfair to compare the styles of these filmmakers with the standard technologies of the day, because both Zemen and Hines "do not compute." They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged only by their creativity. If you look at this movie from a perspective where you know that it has intentionally tried to create a collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that it did a masterful job. It is not easy to make a lot of computer cutouts flow. I thought the creatures were very good, too, considering how they were made. Hines made a big bet, and I think his movie will not be judged in the next few years. Someone promoting the film should have alerted the public to what he would be seeing instead of letting him blindly enter the theater, waiting for the CG's usual work. As for the actors, I think Hines also got a page from Zemen's book, where many of Zemen's actors were a little blank at first, but they became much more attractive with the film and the action. It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I'll watch in the next few years, all three of his big hours.
