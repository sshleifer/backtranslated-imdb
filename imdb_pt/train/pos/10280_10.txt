House of the Games is a spell. It's so good to see occasional movies that are perfect. There are few movies I've seen that can grab you so quickly. From the opening scene, this movie just catches you. <br /> <br /> I'm trying hard not to give much to those who have not yet seen, but there will be FEW SPOILERS, SO DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> I would say that House of Games is not just an excellent movie, but it's the best movie about crooks I've ever seen - none of them. From the moment the movie ends, it asks to be replayed. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse, like Margaret Ford, is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice, she immediately enters the role. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this film is of almost impromptu quality, and these two people communicate as much as with their voices. I also loved the way the film was filmed, that way grainy and surreal, it fit perfectly and helped make the movie what it was. <br /> <br /> There were some movies that I saw and loved. which reminded me of including The Grifters and The Usual Suspects, but really, House of games is completely different in its way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've ever seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that's strong and palpable from the moment they meet but the buildup that starts from the moment they put the eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something will happen, but you have no idea what. And when you think you've guessed what the "thing" is, you realize you have not even scratched the surface ... House of Games is one of those films that can be grouped together. in a certain kind of film type, but it is essentially a film about human nature. The character's study is not just about the swindler's mind but also about the victim. As the movie progresses and we learn more about the main characters, we learn about them not only by what they say but how they say it. It's a great character study and it's flawless in the way it speeds up your conclusion. <br /> <br /> To close, I'd rate this 10 out of 10, call it (although it's not my absolute favorite movie, very high on the list), definitely more remarkable and would go so far as to say that it ranks as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" I've seen too. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to films from the human psyche, it really does not get much better than that. Watch this movie.
