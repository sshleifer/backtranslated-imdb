Firstly, this movie was a wild ride all the way. The story of the training of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors and, in the end, grouping together. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end. This is a war drama that is worth seeing, if you are in constant concern (sometimes beyond reason) and the horrors of that boot camp are. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite surprising at times and sometimes humorous. As Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the plot, from camp to Tigerland, and even in the end helping him. <br /> <br /> Innovative freehand footage has added some flavor or flavor to the film. Constant movement, constant action and only constant confusion. Sometimes it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it has become increasingly realistic. Some points in the movie (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be just a little realistic, although they added an effect to the movie that would not be there without them. was a very bold film, from one side to the other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrell's best movies (if not his best performance). The acting of all the characters was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
