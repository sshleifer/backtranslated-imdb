A jewel of comedy. Much laughter at high moments, the shop and pub scenes left me belly laughing uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue well observed - I know people like that! The humor is surprisingly gentle and the movie (this may sound weird) reminds me of an Ealing comedy. It's a little movie with lots of details. Certainly, it takes a number of visions. I watched it a few times (I showed all my friends!) And noticed something new every time - a bit of dialogue, something visual that I had not noticed before. I could be very picky and find some flaws in the movie, but I will not because, overall, it's a really fun movie, it really pays to be watched and that anyone with a sense of humor should like it. It's a movie that will meet your friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there. Oh .... and it has a great soundtrack.
