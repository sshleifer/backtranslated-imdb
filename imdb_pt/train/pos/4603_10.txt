There is one detail, which is not very common in Jackie Chan movies, but that is present here. It has a very hard and serious atmosphere about it, while the funny elements are present as well. Jackie is menacing and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back (in a usual laid back pattern), but he is the only one who can go and start the turmoil. Your way of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is incredible. Every time it goes "crack!" I also especially appreciate the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and amazes the villains who had led her girlfriend. It is one of the best blitzkriegs placed on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is filmed with the background of some action character painted on the wall (also looks like a "rabochiy" poster from our Soviet era) and a few lines in Russian left (I noticed very accidentally). That sounds great (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also like when the windows are being broken in the movies. There are many of these things here. It's amazing to see the characters falling / jumping / running / driving through all sorts of panels. <br /> <br /> All three films are great. I was getting ready to see the quality down-slide, but I've seen a perfect trilogy with incredible acrobatics and sensations (not just the character of Jackie Chan appearing in all three movies - this is also great and keeps up the continuity). <BR> I would like to describe each movie in a nutshell: No.1 - great (in every respect - it's an exciting story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - furious (Jackie is really * beep * off here) and painful (Jackie is tortured); No.3 - Unbelievable (the woman who fights alongside Jackie is incredible) and bombastic (should I mention many guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest - much has been mentioned by others. <br /> <br /> It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again (at least for me). His place is in the top 10 among action / comedy jewelry. Finally, it was released in Russia on DVD (the second movie has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
