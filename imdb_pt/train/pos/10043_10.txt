This film rewrote the history of cinema in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Each flaw in the film is easily surmounted by the many incredible things the film has for it. It's an extremely beautiful film, and I doubt many of us will see something like that again. I've seen it more often than I care to tell, and I still get paralyzed every time, with a feeling that is hard to describe. One for the ages.
