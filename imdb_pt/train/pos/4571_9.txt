The most important thing about this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christine Brown, a guinea artist and fighter who, despite his physical condition, has outgrown all odds. As a person who worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was incredibly convincing. The enormous support Christy got from his low-income, Dublin-class family encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture described this support brilliantly did not read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture the arrogant personality and spirited by Christy Brown. . I recommend this movie for everyone, especially for lovers of classic films.
