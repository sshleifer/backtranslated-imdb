Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor of the early eighteenth century. He is a true actor. He captivates audiences with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Maria is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her the eternal love. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; One way or another, while watching the movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. The scenery of Scotland is beautiful. The environment and the conditions of the times are described very well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you have to listen carefully if you're not accustomed to a Scottish accent. An important point that makes this movie so good is that no actor or actress is glamourized; they get dirty and really look unattractive in several scenes. It is your ability as actors that attracts you, they do not rely on signage names, popularity or appeal of sex symbol. This is something special.
