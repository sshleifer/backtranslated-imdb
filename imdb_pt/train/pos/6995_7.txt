Pretty nasty piece that features Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes, an assistant of Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (looks like a Greenaway movie actually lol). Lugosi gives his wife injections of death brides (why they? know?) so that his wife can remain beautiful.He receives the brides after doing a very clever trick with some orchids that causes the brides to fall on the altar.After another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter JUST HAPPENS by being around to the spoon, and decides to snoop on a story. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. Soon, she's off to Belle's lair , when she encounters a kind of strange-looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil, it all accumulates in a totally unlikely plan to have a fake marriage to catch the mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has vis the x-ray while it frustrates their plans, Oh no! What will happen? I really enjoyed this movie as a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here, his followers are all very strange, the story is really very unpleasant in some places, which makes everything more watchable. A fun little insight.
