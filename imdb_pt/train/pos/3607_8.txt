So I turned on the digital subscriber channels one night a few years ago and thought about spending half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to begin. With a title like that, I imagined it was a 'B' exploration of urban gangs. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was not about that. Instead, it's a well written and well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally walks into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his training and getting interested while watching his attacks. As he does not really want to be a boxer (just following his father's wishes), she persuades her coach to take her instead. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in a clever and believable way as it goes through various trials in its quest. For starters, her brother's coach does not want to face a boxer. After you do it grudgingly, there is the problem of lining up the games for her. Then the confrontation with his father when he finds out what is happening. Yes, a love interest develops, but serves to improve the plot, going through a more interesting inter-human reaction, with its own consequences related to the fight. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a great movie that sleeps little. few seem to have heard. Some time later, when I saw the much-heralded and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby," I thought, "Wait a minute, this sounds familiar." Needless to say, I did not watch "Hart's War" that night.
