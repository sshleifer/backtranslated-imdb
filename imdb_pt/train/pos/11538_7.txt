Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dismissed by his wife because he is one of the most annoying and neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his exit, but he just can not make it work, so he goes to his friends' house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also recently divorced and lives in the single sky. Smoking, gambling, beating girls, eating out and never clean is heaven for him. Well, with the suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix in. At first, it's a game made in heaven, Felix cooks and clean and helps Oscar to pay his pension on time, but soon Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to follow in front. They invite a couple of British birds and they find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are crying and talking about their family life, leaving Oscar denied. That's it, he explodes and throws away, but Felix is ​​not as impotent as he looks, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote "You give me small notes on my pillow. I told you 158 times that I can not stand small notes on the pillow." We're all out of corn flakes. F.U. "It took three hours to find out that F.U was Felix Ungar!" Based on a play by Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), this has a certain theatrical climate. Define and replica and seems to feel quite like playing (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and appeared in the Old Men and Out to Sea movies, rewriting the same pampered / sloppy roles but with different names (to avoid royalty issues, I'm sure). <br /> This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. Chocolate is soft, sweet and rich, the strawberry is sour, juicy and bright red (unless you have those nasty greenish ones). They are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts stand out and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
