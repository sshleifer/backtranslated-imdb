This film is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter stuck in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the always illusory question of "who am I" and "what am I?" It is a courageous and thought-provoking enterprise. There is a pile of beautiful images, inspired by the dream, like Escher's paradoxes that resemble the hand itself, or rather, fading. More and more we follow the writer in his agony about what to say and what to film, we see him phoning his wife who left for Peru, leaving him to take care of his baby, a task that he accomplishes with less and less attention until He is so engrossed in his dilemma that he barely looks at the child. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him to surpass the last treshold until he goes out. Interspersed with pleasant and eye-destroying images, the story is mostly philosophical. It is about the veils of Maya, the world of illusion. The paradox of the film, however, is that it needs to talk and think hard to prove that thinking should stop. During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and quick philosophizing, the film made me long for silence or a shorter film. If that was the goal of the creator, he did very well.
