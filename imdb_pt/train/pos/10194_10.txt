That would have worked much better had it been made like "Mitchell in Malta". At least then we would have been spared from the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise Mediterranean setting in that ridiculous cowboy outfit-not to mention acting like a gunslinger in the Wild West. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film would not have suffered with the lack of free police brutality as well. Oh well. At least Mike's comic comments and the Bots made this nice show an episode of the MST. I can not imagine watching on my own, though.
