I saw it on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky." I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for this, which, as usual, was of very good quality. I just searched "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirm what I suspected ... the floating island of this tale is drawn from Jonathan Swift's classic novel "Gulliver's Travels," which was published early in the 1700's. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a Japanese fairy tale, which features an English speaking voice cast. It is suitable for small children, I think, but it works in just over two hours so it may be too long for some but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island that has a castle on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, army and spies looking for the island too, and seek to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, dubbed by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help them to find <br /> <br /> The graphics are magnificent ... kind of photo-realistic at times, especially the scenes of torch-lit rocks, or the beautiful scenes of bright and sunny days with white clouds, or mist . <br /> <br /> Recommended.
