I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea in this movie is that most people understand that Sharon Stone is about 50 and gets naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the Golden Girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussed their first orgasm, but seeing someone post-menopause getting digitally satisfied while driving, I think it's too much for some to handle. Let's face it, she seems to be good, she's light years warmer than my mother who is the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic as the first, but since the turn of the century all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It is the character of Catherine Trammell who helped give way to this sequence. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that icy queen of ice. The cinematographic and art direction was exuberant and extravagant and made me want to go to Britian for sure. The score is incredible too. <br /> <br /> Of course there are some exaggerations of some characters, but there is a brilliant work of David Morrissey that is practically unknown. <br /> <br /> There is a setback in that the script is pretty much the same as the first movie just connecting a psychiatrist to the cop's place. As well as the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to be cut even further, it takes away the sense of guilt and pleasure by which the story is known. <br /> <br /> At the very least, it's fun and fun. fun to watch, and are the only intentions of the movie. So if you have something with Mizz Stone, maybe you should SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before vomiting your projectile vomit?
