Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most beautiful Jane of all, and there will never be a prettier one. She is visually stunning. Besides, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. Not only has Tarzan's classic aura, but also the sense of continuation of the saga. We get involved with the two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other a rogue catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best scrutinized in film history. And these characterizations are what do this. excellent action movie stands out as a classic. There is the uncomfortable racism that is described. However, Africans are portrayed as individuals and, in the end, two even become more heroic than white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, what is not mentioned probably evokes more public sympathy than any other character. The ending, too, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great attack of the lions has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied in the reactions of the characters, more than a modern gore film would do with a graphic representation. If I left something out, it is because I do not want to dirty the image to those who have not yet seen it. But it's all you could want in a movie.
