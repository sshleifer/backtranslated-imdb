Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of cinema noir. This is certainly your best. <br /> <br /> There are some of the standard features of what we now call film noir. Although manufactured in the United States, it is entirely in England. There are no gangsters. You do not have a femme fatale. There is no lack of crime. <br /> <br /> The title character responds to an ad. She is very happy that she will make some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a scary plot. Only a very strong person could survive a terribly disturbing ordeal. And Nina Foch gives the feel of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from the cast versus the type: Mrs. Foch has an elegant way. She is not a frightened victim. She is actually a bit cold and patriotic, though no money. This makes your character's situation even more convincing. <br /> <br /> Certainly the most fascinating element is the cast of Dame May Witty. She was (and is) probably most famous for the charming title character of "The Lady Vanishes". She has a sweet way and a harmless and slightly hesitant way. But here she is far from being a hero. <br /> <br /> George Macready is excellent as his extremely disturbed son. The whole cast, in fact, is superb. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant film was made almost by chance. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a low budget. This is the excitement and charm of film noir, the real movie noir: it's small, convincingly low and, in this case, unforgettable.
