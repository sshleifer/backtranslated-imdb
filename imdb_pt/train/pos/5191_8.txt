Scott is right. The best sword duel of 2 people ever placed in the film is in the middle of this movie. Sword fights with various fighters are not the best, although they are very good. However, the struggle in between is the best, even compared to Japanese samurai movies. The scenes of Chinese fencing in my opinion never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a guy must fight a bunch of enemies, Japanese movies are great, like Lone Wolf and Cub. Although duels in Japanese movies last only a few seconds or a minute, the intensity of these moments makes them better. But this is one example where Chinese fencing overtakes the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this movie was a five-minute fight with the most incredible choreography of all time. The other fights in this movie are also good, but even if they suck this movie, they would be 7 for that scene. If you have not seen it yet, you must. John Woo is the man.
