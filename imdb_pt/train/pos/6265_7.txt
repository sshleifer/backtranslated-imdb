Nick and Kelly are ready to marry, but Travis (Kelly's dog) takes Nick to a strange blue wall that will change Kelly's honeymoon. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick likes to drink, smoke and play billiards with the guys to have fun, but Nick abstains from this kind of fun. Sex is the only thing he loves because he wants a child. We have discovered that an alien race is dying and needs to mingle with women on Earth to save their population. It becomes a survival battle between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved. A good movie.
