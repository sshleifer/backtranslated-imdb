For those who do not know what an actor's movie was like, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really does not make sense. It is full of situations clich√©s, banal lines, melodrama, comedy ... his name! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can make anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception. Everyone turns into a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Rehman Waheeda, Ranjit, Prakash Om, Smita Patil ... But it's the Megastar that overshadows everyone with his imposing presence. Without it, this movie would have been unusual ... The story is about separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good against evil - all, really! Amitabh is a brilliant performance in every way, in an otherwise silly movie! And did I mention that it's ridiculously funny?
