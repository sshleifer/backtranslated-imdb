Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great phenomena of pop culture of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena we see today (in the 70s - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). This made Novak a star, put a good article on Jack Lemon's resume, shed new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both continued to play witches and other curious "old bats" ). "in film and television. Along with the 1940s film I Married a Witch (which helped make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great film and the fascination of TV with all things that began with Bewitched and continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter.What I rarely see noticed is that the film is also a rather interesting alternative Christmas film. Christmas holidays and, in spite of the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a lot of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I always watch this film (I've seen it several times since the first time I watched it in the early 90s), especially if it's shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style, substance, a great cast and excellent production values. And like the Adam's Rib, casually expresses ideas that are have been radical enough for their time, are radical even now (in both films, the female character is innocent and powerful), and so it always seems ahead of time.
