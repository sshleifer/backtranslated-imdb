I participate in a filmmaker's Symposium, and this movie was shown after we had already seen a not-so-good movie and participated in a 40-minute discussion. Even though it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really liked it. <br /> <br /> Personally I found the movie hilarious in all the right places, and I loved the quirky cast of characters. They really grow up in you in the movie.
