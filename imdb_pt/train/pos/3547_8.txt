Fun musical where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to get up in a floating shit game, so he seduces Sky Masterson to try to get the Salvation Army girl, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later Simmons would again be on the missionary in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry." There she was, Sister Sharon, and here she is, Sister Sarah. The same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is that fiendish Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she dislikes his gambling habit. <br /> <br /> In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando, who actually made his own singing here! <Br /> <br /> The film is saved by superlative choreography. These dancing and singing routines are fabulous. They are especially perceived by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good production.
