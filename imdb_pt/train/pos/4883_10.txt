We, as a family, were so delighted with 'The Last of the Blonde Bombshells' that we bought a copy for our home video library. <br /> <br /> The acting is A1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script is well written. The songs / songs are timeless and take us back to our days of youth, when we sing the songs at the top of our voices. Sketching the story here would spoil the 'plot', since it's great to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Complete marks for this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we strongly recommend that anyone looking for a laugh and lots of music.
