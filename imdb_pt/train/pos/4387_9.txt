This is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is pure and direct. In fact, it is the standard story of a simple and honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the most learned and wealthy men of the period. Poor vs. Rich, Honest vs. dishonorable, a classic but well told story without much of the hollywood gleam smelling the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)
