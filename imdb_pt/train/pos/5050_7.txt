We really like Gray Owl: a simple tale well told in classic Attenborough fashion: a bit romanticized with archetypes, humor, and a stress of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and told in a beautiful rhythm this is the true story of Archie, an Englishman turned native Indian, and went to live and imprison in Canada. <br /> <br /> Solid presentations from everyone who makes this movie with an easy-to-view message. <br /> <br /> Two of the movie's stars are arguably the cutest we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecoleanings. It must have been great to know or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a fitting tribute to the movies.
