Footlight Parade is among the best musical comedy extravaganza of the 1930s. A grumpy script and a cast of stars, including Jimmy Cagney, the lovely Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, make this film a little above of the rest. Directed and choreographed by creative genius Busby Berkeley, this movie will make you smile back and forth from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Busby, of course, is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street" to his credit (as a dance director). Footlight Parade is graced by hundreds of half-naked showgirls, a trademark of Berkeley. The elaborate dance numbers were filmed with just one camera and Busby was the first director to shoot close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and "rear-view" shots is amply demonstrated here. The overall effect is highly erotic and hypnotizing. <br /> <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of prologues or small musical stage productions that were shown in theaters to entertain audiences before the talkies were shown. showing. He's surrounded by dishonest partners, a corporate spy, and a gold-digging girlfriend. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, this was the first film in which he showed off his dance talents. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's passionate secretary. And Ruby Keeler is lovely, as always. The film climaxes with three excellent production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each a masterpiece and be duplicated in today's Hollywood, where so-called "special effects" replaced creative filmmaking. Claudia Line: Intelligent and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever placed on the celluloid. A joke was very nice Depression.
