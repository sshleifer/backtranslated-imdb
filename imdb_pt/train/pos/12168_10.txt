"A Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it sure is a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the morning after his stateless bachelor party and Becky (Julia Stiles) lying naked on his bed. Before he can find out what happened, he takes Becky out of his apartment because his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that, as you can imagine, the chaos begins. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" brings laughter. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what could happen if he told Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that it's underutilized. Although, she is funnier than the character of Stiles, which is not really that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> Like I said, "A Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's nothing, 7/10.
