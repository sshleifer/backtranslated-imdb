Wow!! I loved this movie and I LOVE Judy Mars !! This girl is not just a pretty face, she is funny and very talented !! She made me laugh many times just for being too rude to Victor who was desperately pounding her! We'll be seeing it a lot in the next few years ... and probably also by director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, good, funny, well filmed, has it all: good story, good actors, good film direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow-paced, real life, urban movies, like maybe Kevin Smith's Girl's Jersey, you'll love Victor Vargas! Is better!
