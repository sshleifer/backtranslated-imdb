I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers outside of Romania. That certainly says something about the value, or perhaps about the film's lack of universality, but it also says something about how the story and even the lives of ordinary people were different in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the communist regime shortly after the book was published. He tells the story of an intellectual, philosophy professor whose life is crushed after he is arrested on false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to reclaim his life after being released. His release is in fact only apparent, Romania of the 60s asks him for different types of commitments and crimes, but his struggle for survival is as strong morally as prison. <br /> <br /> The film is splendidly represented by some. of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who has the main role, would be another time and another place, a mega-star, we can get a good glimpse here of his fabulous acting art. Although he suffers from a hesitant story told and sometimes falls into nonessential details or character comics, the film is still an important landmark of Romanian cinema as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
