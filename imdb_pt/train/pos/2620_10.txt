What a pleasant surprise: A sequel to Disney DTV (Direct to Video) which is really GOOD. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy case involving meerkat and everyone's favorite boar, Timon and Pumba. It starts with them watching the original movie and making comments, until Timon complains that "we're not here yet." After fighting for the remote control, Timon and Pumba decide to tell the public "their story". They start the new movie, and the laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope at Disney. Most of his direct passage to the video has been aggressively awful, with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story of a new point of view. Okay, add a few things, like where Timon came from and how he and Pumba met, but that's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first film. There are also some parodies of cool movies (including a scene that simultaneously plays "Good, Bad and Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke"), and the script is filled with funny and memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added to the cast are Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as the mother of Timon's concern, and Jerry Stiller as Timon's Uncle Max. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone does well, especially Robert Guillame (this is how you spell it?) As Rafiki, who emanates more and more speaks Yoda in this film (Timon comments this several times). <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1 1/2' is a perfect alternative choice for those who are tired of the animation animation. 10/10
