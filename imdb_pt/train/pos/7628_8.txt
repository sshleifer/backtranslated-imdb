This movie is one of those "WOW!" movies. Not because it's the best movie ever, but because it surprised me. It was not just a TV movie, but it was in Elvis. I can safely say as many imitators as there is only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel came very close to being the real thing. It was one of the biggest imitations I've ever seen. He made me believe it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis life watching this movie. And it did not take the television part to let you get lost - it's really a really fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twin :)
