This movie is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious lessons in history, so simply accept it as it is. Bing, in his inimitable style ever, has a very good performance as the blacksmith Hank Martin, who by accident is transported to another era, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking like Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hank's affection, although she is engaged to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I simply love this episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) wear ragged clothes and head for the road with their backpacks to try out the kingdom firsthand. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we're not alone," while giving a good scratch to his dirty clothes, is one of those hilarious moments in the movie. The portrait of William Bendix is ​​supremely ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at singular "Ye Olde English." <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but it is well made in my opinion and I like it more every time I see it. It is also great entertainment for the family. <br /> <br />
