"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed with that. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never explores or develops it. It's well done and fun, but not as interesting as it should have been. The script for this one is really weak and brings the whole movie down. None of the central characters is really convincing or believable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well done, so it makes up for the poor script. The direction of Elia Kazan keeps the movie full of suspense and moves in a lightning pace. There are a few prominent sequences, particularly the memorable climax of the chase. When his direction was combined with better scripts several years later, the man could not go wrong. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been an assistive leadership man and does what he can with a subscribed character. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming too much but also does a decent job. The highlights of the cast are the two villains. Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comedic roles, is effectively slimy as one of the most incredible characters in the cinema. Jack Palance is, without surprise, a creepy villain. "Panic in the Streets" is disappointing, but still worth watching. (7/10)
