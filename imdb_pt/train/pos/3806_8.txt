This movie took my breath away in a few moments, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the dialogues and plotting of the characters could have been made a little better, but, hey, this is just a simple (short) story of some guys trying to kill a dragon, there's nothing more for him! <br /> <br /> The overall design, atmosphere, the beautiful scenery ... is all just magical! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love in this movie. Character designs were great and funny. A little Tim Burton-ish if you like. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design, displayed in a simple but lovely little story.
