Here is a rare gem for those of you who have not seen or probably have not even heard of it. During the 1980s, Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early '90s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all unfortunately bombed. Two of those movies that I really enjoyed, and let me elaborate on one of them. "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who they are ... fire starters: yes, they have the power of pyrokinetics. Wilder decided to no longer use his power (for anything that was not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother exploded an abandoned house that killed a man who was inside unsuspecting for them. Nowadays Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the wacky Life (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest for, guess what, criminal fire (see the movie to understand better). Wilder also did not speak to Wallace in 5 years because Wallace set fire to his hair during his bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his pyrotechnic power and uses it for fun. He also runs a carnival and is the main clown. When the Carnival arrives in the city of Wilder, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see Vida, for whom Wallace is in love! The house arrest of Vida comes to an end, but Wilder is worried. Then Wallace walks in and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fighting fire with fire! <br /> <br /> A great ball of fire casting this movie ... devouring your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The movie also has some strange but funny elements, such as Wilder's fire unit. sings acapella songs during shootings and then in wards. Jim Varney (worldwide known as "Ernest") appears as Wallace's friendless carnival friend. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliantly filmed ... and cleverly placed ... very off the wall and the vanguard guard. <br /> <br /> Give this one a look ...
