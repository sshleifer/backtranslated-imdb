Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark's A Chinese Ghost Story, in addition to being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that must belong to the collection of all movie lovers. The painfully lost Hong Kong star Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple. While staying in the temple, he encounters a colorful cast of characters including the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Tree Devil, and the handsome ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the lovely Joey Wong. To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Devil, he must reincarnate his body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> Enough of good things that can not be said about this movie. The rhythm is perfect with an excellent combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverishly rhythmic ending should leave you with little chance of breathing. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended very early) really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. Actually, acting in general is so vivacious and full of life, I would say this is one of the funniest viewing experiences I have ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his interpretation of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His over-the-top persona of a disillusioned swordsman who strives to defeat evil, leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful soundtrack, a lush cinematography with bright colors and frantic action pieces, courtesy of Ching Siu Tung, complete this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10
