This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen - I have not seen Alias ​​- and I was curious to see if the guy can act. He sure can and is nice in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is, of course, beautiful, but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and lovely in this "sweet" role other than a teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the movie is full of cliches and the story does not sound true. Also, while all the characters in the movie comment on how good they are together, I do not think there's screen chemistry there. However, I liked this movie. The locals are good, the characters are friendly and cute and the supporting actors are very good. If you're hoping to see a great novel, that's not it. But if you want to see a nice innocent movie goodlooking with friendly characters is very good.
