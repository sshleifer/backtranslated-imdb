I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality for this review. Also, this review will be much more meaningful to you once you have seen the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is tragically sad to say, this movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so impressive that it is truly scary. The rest of you will never know how accurately the film describes how people who have been in such situations act and react in their later lives. <br /> <br /> This could not have been a work of fiction; had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testament to how good the film was is shown by the fact that although it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a painful experience that I will never be able to see him again. <br /> <br /> But I endorse you cordially to all others as a chance to peer into the soul of another human being to the extent that you have probably never experienced it before or never again. I know that, because that's my soul you'll be watching.
