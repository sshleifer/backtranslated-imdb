This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or movies like this to keep the culture of South Asia alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have acted very well in this, also their couple attracts many people to the movies. This is a must-see movie, it's a family movie and romantic. This film is also from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is your best now ... the setting of the movie was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie needs to be seen ... recommended to everyone !!
