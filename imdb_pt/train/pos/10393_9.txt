Let's cut a long story short. Loved every minute. A luxurious fantasy in true Arabian-style nights. There is an evil wizard, a beautiful princess, a djinn and everyone lives happily ever after. The modern Hollywoond has one or two things to learn from this classic. Just dodge: the special effects are pretty old-fashioned (loved Sabu with the djinn's foot, though!)
