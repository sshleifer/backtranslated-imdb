"Stories of the Century" was a half-hour series and appeared in the first edition of the 1954 television season. It was also the first Western TV series to win an Emmy. Starring veteran western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, the series put Clark and his fellow rail detectives (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" during the second half) against the historic West outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch and quite realistic due mainly to the laid-back charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He looked like a real Western character. Another note. When Matt Clark arrived in town after a long drive, he seemed to be on a long ride because it would be covered in dust. A good western adult.
