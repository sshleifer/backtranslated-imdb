I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight when I was connected. I still remember the first episode that was called "The New House". That scared me! I can almost still hear this statue, laughing madly. And the end, oh my God! The hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: Yikes! This was the classic TV and was one of a kind series. I found a collection of DVDs for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any reader: Has anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD of the episode "The New House", and a few other episodes that are a bit better, however, if anyone knows if they are much clearer, it would be worth buying and sharing with my friends. children. A great series, clever, scary and boldly supernatural. Thanks in advance to all fans who have the bass down on any of this, in fact, I would love to discuss this. Chris Walker
