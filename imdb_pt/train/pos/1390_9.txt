If you love the cult 70 Sci-fi the way I do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" than you'll love this. It's a stream of consciousness from the spectacular 1970s science fiction, including a junkyard of the 22nd century and the Earth a million years from now. This movie is pure from the 70's. Put Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "Side of the Moon" and you're good to go!
