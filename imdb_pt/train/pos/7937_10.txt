I thought the movie "I Do not Do It" was fantastic. In the past I've seen Rob Estes in "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett in "Melrose Place" and I loved seeing them together again in "I Do not Do It". They have a great chemistry together (I think being married in real life helps in that!) - in the movie, both are children's widows and careers and they fall in love and try to mix their families already occupied and chaotic without dropping the ball. Of course they stumble, but they stay together, and that's where they work and raise a family. So many people have been talking about this movie - all the best! - and the movie left us wanting more. That would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so good to see a real life, with your feet on the ground, family shows that portray the reality of many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "Reality TV", that all seasons are overloading us with these days. Someone tell ABC Family staff that they have the start of a new series here!
