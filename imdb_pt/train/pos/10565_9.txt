In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced through three Warner Brother musicals, which offered the Depression Age audience a momentary distraction from their troubles. The Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the Broadway theater, basically with the same program theme. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured Busby Berkeley's kaleidisc√≥pica choreography, showing songs that stopped and many of the same supporting players. <br /> <br /> All are undoubtedly classics of their genre, but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to the energy of the rhythm and leads James Cagney. Warren William at Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter at 42nd Street perform admirably as showmaking bosses - particularly Baxter as the burnt-out Julian Marsh in pursuit of a latest box office hit. Both do not have the infectious energy of Cagney, however, which perfectly complements the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute maelstrom as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold-digging girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Clear Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The screenplay resonates with some double-handed performances by a superlative supporting cast with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell, who cuts everyone to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risky and made exactly the moment prior to the arrival of the Hollywood Code at 34. Unfortunately, the 1930s and some time beyond would never see a musical so richly produced with verve and insolence by Footlight. again. Gentleness and morality ensured this.
