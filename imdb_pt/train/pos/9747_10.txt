I remember seeing this movie when it was first released in 1982 and I loved it then. About 4 years later, I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca), so seeing the end of this movie reminds me a lot of that great night. What's not to like about this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The story is really funny in parts and the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful and so was the song he sang "If We Were In Love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And listening to the beautiful Santa Lucia duet. Get real people, this was a movie about an opera singer named Georgio Fini, who was eventually played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to still have this almost worn out VHS tape from this movie, but I would love for it to be released on DVD, especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes Nessun's best performance Dorma sung by him still in the movies today!
