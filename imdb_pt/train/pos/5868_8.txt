I love this movie. It's rare to get a glimpse of postpartum Vietnam, and this movie - no battle scenes, exciting bombs and shots - did it. I had no idea that I would be so affected by it. What an incredible look as veterinary aliens feel. It was hard to watch, frankly. We all understand the struggle and drama type Apocalypse Now, but this is so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can not. This made me very aware of a large group of men who are lost in the United States. He is not able to relate, he can not sleep, he can not have love affairs, he can not deal with "normal society". They feel totally separate. This is a huge tragedy, and one that is not addressed enough. Yes, we changed our attitude about Vietnam Vets, we like them now, but so what? It does not seem to make any difference to them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticisms.
