the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. This movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. the museum scene is like a good music video. the apres sex scene is a very familiar scene in all our adult lives. but the film would not interest me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting came from studying your eyes mostly. he had the most convincing face. your character has the qualities that I see in a face, sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is handsome. BTW, I'd like him to shave his beard now, while his lips, Adam's chin and apple were the cutest one next to his eyes.
