Any film that deals with fanaticism in a positive way is a film that still has to be seen by the current public, since the message and the moral of the story will always be relevant, as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the movie is really an old fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl ... boy gets girl back .... <br /> <br /> The weaker role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lieutenant General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is a close second) ... my question would be how he came to be a 3-star general ... the character is a coward in the presence of his wife and subordinate military, it is a wonder they show him some respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit overdone, and some scenes have some holes, but overall I like the movie every time I see Red Buttons is great ... I always love watching comedians in roles dramatic ... as in the case of Button, often a comedian can better portray a person's tragedy than a more traditional d. ramatico actor
