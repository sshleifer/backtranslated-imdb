Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's. It's a breathtaking film through incredible acting and a very interesting directional touch. In Jacknife, lovers of European and American cinema can find things to relate to. The script is very attractive and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the biggest performances to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in every line, in every movement. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also the most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife is never boring because it shows its clear heroes of any typical Hollywood character. After the war, no one is a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. Nobody can fix their pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply gorgeous movie.
