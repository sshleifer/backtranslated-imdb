Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to have flaws - Rear Window seems a little at times, Chris Elliot's character on Groundhog Day does not work, the soundtrack in Best Years of Our Lives is very corny, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a bit too slow - but this movie runs perfectly from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, the acting is great everywhere (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), direction and photography are inspired, and the soundtrack is playing without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are very manipulative). Every sad moment is truly moving, every moment of light makes me smile. This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen and I wish there were more movies like this. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon has come to stardom after this movie, but I regret to see that his recent films are far more escapist and foolish than this serious film about real people, real feelings, and real problems. Bright! Unmissable.
