This fun and noisy copy of "Desire for Death" stars as the supreme and delightful brunette Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a top martial arts fighter and a woman who destroys the crew and opens a giant ten-gallon drum. from ferocious chopsocky whup-a ** into blabbering assailants, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-aged criminals attack their beloved grandparents. The incredibly voluptuous Mrs. Mani sinks her teeth into her vigorous hardcore chick with a victorious and lively way, beating up contagious subjects with her contagious joy and showing off her luscious body smoking in some totally gratuitous but highly prized nudity scenes. Unfortunately, Mani has a harsh, harsh voice that annoys the marbles and irritates the ears (my favorite moment in Mani's dubious delivery in his dialogue occurs when she plays "Do not play with girls in the park; that's no good!" Later Karen's only subsequent role in the film was in "Avenging Angel," in which she does a totally chilling frontal nudity scene, but has no lines.) The only sensationally more vulgar sequence occurs when Mani is imprisoned for a brief period of contempt for legal charges and shows her considerably substantial material in a group prison shower scene. Of course, Mani's lascivious and lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her just to have her unwanted advances rejected with a severe beating! Strangely, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best friend while she is behind the bars. Given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously sturdy arm of Edward Victor's direction, a funky, captivating rock track for a game (if lame), a fast-paced, steady pace, several pull-out-all exciting fighting scenes, and the bold photograph of Howard Anderson III, this immensely nice down'n'dirty scanning swill is the essential vision for fans of low-grade grindhouse low-grade grindhouse cinema hardcore hardcore fans.
