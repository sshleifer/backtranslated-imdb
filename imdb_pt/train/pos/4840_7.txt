I saw the recent Region 2 DVD of this movie shown in the "horror" section at an Oxford Street store and also advertised as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades. Perhaps his incessantly cheerful, exuberant, and essentially humorous humor comes as a cultural shock to many accustomed to the sour, cynical taste of much British comedy of the last twenty-five years. However, there are still those who appreciate their cheerful and joyful personality and total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed the "self-choking" gag that Arthur tries to entertain stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a rare and surprising appearance at least appreciated Linden. Travers, who makes an impact as the mysterious Julie.
