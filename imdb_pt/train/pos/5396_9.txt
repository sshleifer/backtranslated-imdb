Simple, meaningful and provides an emotional impact. I usually follow through short films and it's always nice to find something that has a simple and enlightened message, no pretensions or self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> A kid at school has to attend a class when his friend throws away and receives the most important lesson of his life, only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around, he has to share with the school bully. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the short films with children or actors that these children have and are believable. The soundtrack nicely complements the thrill of the play and the movie joke works well.
