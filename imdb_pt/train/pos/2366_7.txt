This movie (with the alternate title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are great! There are many of them too, by the way. The recruitment struggle in the Peacekeepers' HQ is especially good. There's just something about a single guy beating the crap out of a lot of people that's a lot of fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this fit her (but others do not). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and a male character, and was a good rival to Wincott in this movie.
