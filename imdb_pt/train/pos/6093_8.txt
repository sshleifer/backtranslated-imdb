I've only seen this movie in a preview and all I can say is ... "What did I just watch ????" And I mean it in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is the dedicated worker, while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that extinguishes poop. The idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black wins and the fact that he still tries to be Stiller's best friend makes Stiller go crazy with envy. <br /> <br /> Like I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is strange. The steering is strange, with a strange rotating aperture for out-of-nothing accelerated sequences. The dialouge and the acting are very strange; Strange in a disjointed way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie, from the weird "Envy" song that keeps popping up on the scene where you think you're going to hear classical music from the '80s, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> So the real question is this ... is it weird funny? This depends only on the individual. I was cracking up with the unshakable strangeness of the movie. After the performance, I heard the people call it horribly bland and glad they were free. Strangely, I understood their point. There are no jokes, so if you're not addicted to the uniqueness of it all, you're going to hate this movie. Absolutely hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie is bound to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a cult classic of DVD. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you watch it. If you do not, run away from this movie. This will only drive you crazy.
