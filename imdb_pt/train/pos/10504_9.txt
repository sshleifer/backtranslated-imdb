Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser is up to his usual periz√©cias (yes, it's a stupid word, but the only one I can think of) and Mario must stop it again. This game is a lot of fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about this are the graphics, which are terrible by today's standards, but everything else is very good (especially the little minigames that you can unlock). It's the second best N64 game (the first best is Conker's Bad Fur Day) which I recommend for any Mario fan, or any fan of platform games. Beat the mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
