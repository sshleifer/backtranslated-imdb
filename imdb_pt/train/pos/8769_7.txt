Gentleman Jim is another case of imprinting the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxing fighter as a brash but charismatic social climber in a fun entertainment that barely stops breathing. It is as meaningless to look for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's Charge of the Light Brigade - this is pure mere with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by the vivid direction of Raoul Walsh. Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you never imagined he suffered a mild heart attack during production) with Alexis Smith, a handsome romantic partner and perpetual companion Alan Hale together for a good measure, this time as the father of Flynn (Jack Carson assumes secondary functions this time). In fact, even the pirate galleon of Flynn's earlier films makes a small out-of-place appearance in a fight on the dock! The 103 minutes just pass.
