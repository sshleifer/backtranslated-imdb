Like the characters in this show, I was also a teenager during the 1970s. Producers really preached the entire zeitgeist, from being a suburban teenager in the 1970s. The 1970s fashion, cars, decorations, food and fads are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show has a fairly talented cast, which fits in well with the camera. I really like the unique sequences of psychedelic-style movies. No other show does camera tricks like this. These cutting-edge movie sequences really help convey the exaggerated hip-hop that characterized the 1970s era. Overall, this is a very funny comedy. The only thing that bothers me about this show, is excessive reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs. In this way, I think this show tries to be a lot like Married With Children. While Married with Children is a great sitcom by itself, it's corny that the creators of "That 70s" program, try to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend the show of the 70's mainly because of its nostalgia factor. It could be an even better spectacle if the writers relied more on witty dialogues, instead of jokes and obscene and tasteless jokes.
