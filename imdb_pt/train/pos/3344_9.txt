I went to see Febre with my mother and I can say that we both loved it. It was not the typical romantic comedy where one is yearning for the other, and blah blah blah ... You were not expecting the first kiss of the weather or they finally joined. It was more real because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie being about them getting together. People could actually relate to the movie because it did not seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was very funny, and I think it was the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
