If you've ever wondered why they do not do porn with a plot, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give the credit to Armstrong both for striving to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it. On the other hand, it also becomes apparent quickly because most pornographies never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue connecting sex scenes. These people simply can not act (and the story is, unfortunately, ridiculous to a ridiculous degree). <br /> <br /> Still, I gave it a 7th note because it was a good try and there did not seem to be much of an effort to cut corners. Also, I would like to see more attempts like this. Maybe one day I'll see the perfect combination of pornography and plot.
