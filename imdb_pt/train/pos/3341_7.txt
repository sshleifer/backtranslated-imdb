I saw this movie on Thursday nights after having a very boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were pretty negative. Being that the only movie I've ever seen on Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously .. this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet a cute nerd like that? :) Movies like that are great. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursdays. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we do not have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment.) Haha
