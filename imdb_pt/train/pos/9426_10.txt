This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed to my sides to separate and roll on the floor. If only someone would liberate America. Region 0 or 1 - No PAL, please. <br /> <br /> I know it's being released in the UK, but it's Region 2 and PAL! Let's give this series its just shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved the quirky and playful role of Tracie Bennett in that. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Advertise this show in America! or show it again on PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please satisfy us, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
