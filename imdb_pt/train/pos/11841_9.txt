This was a great movie with a good story. My kids (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this movie, including me. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses do not speak, but the story is told by the Spirit. And to hear a story told by a horse's point if the sight was amusing. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit." This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I would have to say that my 4 year old boy and the 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie, and even if they got involved in it, they laughed so much, and twisted by the spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and have your spirit excited about this comforting story. Your kids will love it. I think you do too.
