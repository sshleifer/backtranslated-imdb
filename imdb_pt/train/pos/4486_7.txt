SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon with a perfect idea, and almost all short are a jewel. Although I must say that this is definitely an inferior shorts compared to other Tom and Jerry classics, there is no way you hate this cartoon. Of course, it's understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than others. Well, that would fit into the "others." <br /> <br /> Here is Fraidy Cat's plot. Tom is listening to an old, scary radio broadcast and is easily startled. Jerry notices how scared he is, and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates scary dilemmas for Tom, and Tom is afraid of his intelligence and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet on a vacuum cleaner and controls it, making it look like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom discovers that Jerry has done all this and pursues him. Tom then accidentally bites the maid. However, in the end, Jerry ends up getting scared after he sees his reflection in a cup of flour. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is far from the best short Tom and Jerry out there, but this is still a fun and fun piece of time. It makes me wish there were more cartoons like that. The slapstick and the jokes that make famous Tom and Jerry are as good as ever in this short, but it seemed like something was missing in it. It seemed slower than most of Tom and Jerry's shorts. Anyway, this is a good summary that does not match some other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> 7/10
