Excellent lot within a land within a plot. It's a shame that two of my movie heroes get a good kiss. It must be my creation :) Very well represented by all. You never know who will outdo who. The last little twist at the end allows everyone to get their mere deserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. A harmless and playful one who, if he has a flaw, is probably Michael Caine's overuse of the word "bloody," but that's his signature, is not it? <br /> <br /> 9/10
