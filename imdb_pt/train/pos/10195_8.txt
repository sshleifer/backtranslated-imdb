Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors that is often better than his material and is almost always being appreciated. He's in a ton of movies, whether heavy or heroic, and has the kind of strong, solid presence Wallace Beery made half a century before. Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about it. He really seems to mean what he's saying, no matter how clich√©d, obvious or foolish, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial success in the theaters and videos of the 1980s, and has aged far better than many of the perhaps best-known action films of the era. By moving action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not detract from the onscreen action. To be honest, I've always liked the films of Greydon Clark, who is a sensible director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost jewels of the late 80's, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true courage and violence. I suppose if they redo it with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.
