I just saw this movie opening night tonight. It was great!! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and that was one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ... and she should buy you a drink once ... well ... she kind of endured ... but she did not mean !: C) [not that anyone will believe it ...]) ANYWAY, it's a great movie. Everyone who likes a good sports film, should go out and see! : W)
