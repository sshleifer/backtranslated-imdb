This video rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does he have class, he does some of the funniest remarks about history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the most original and clever comic I've seen in a long time. Tell all the other stand-ups to leave the stage and leave this "executive" reign!
