Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, the reckless rebel cop who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he makes (38 and counting), he never stops chasing the bad guys. When a top-of-the-line American tank called "Thunderblast" is driven across the border into Mexico, it is arrested by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva) , who lined up with Russian villains. The Army personnel involved are held as prisoners, the main ones being Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have the physical presence to say, someone like Schwarzenegger, which would have been another appropriate clue to such a film, but he is an explosion like a self-confident guy who is quick with the jokes. Fluegel is a great female protagonist; she not only looks incredibly sexy but also makes a great bikini. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and the always welcome William Smith (as Russian major) are repulsive slag in the classic tradition of the action movie. The supporting cast is quite full of actors of familiar and reliable character: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Watson Mills, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and BJ Goldman provide the script, based on a story by Lankford and the director of veteran B, Fred Olen Ray. It's the kind of script in which you know writers have their tongues on their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and tacky, and just have fun throwing credibility out the window. Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps him on the move and offers a respectable amount of widespread gunfire, explosions and chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is good fun for the action fan who does not mind shutting down his brain from time to time and just enjoying a generous range of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
