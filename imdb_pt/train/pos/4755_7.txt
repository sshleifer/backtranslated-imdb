A bus full of passengers is trapped during a snowstorm. Police have closed the bridge - saying it is unsafe and they are stuck in a small cafe until the road has been cleared. However, after a while, your boredom is turned to concern as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and might just be an alien! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also quite funny, in a low-brow way. <br /> <br /> This is another fun episode in The Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical twists and turns, it does not present a lasting message. However, it is also very watchable, so who cares? Exactly what happens, you just need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this one stars John Hoyt - a face that most of you will recognize from countless TV shows and old movies. In almost every case he made a real grunt (like Charles Lane at the same time), but I loved to see him - as he perfected the grumpy personality and was kind of funny at the same time.
