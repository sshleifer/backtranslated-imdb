The indicated surprise of the best proof of Animation this year at the Oscars. It is an Irish color film but was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with animators working in the three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The character design is somewhat reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis a few years ago, with very simple characters with thick, black outlines. This movie is not in black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is the use of color, simply a bit of the most outrageous and amazing use of the colors I've ever seen. The overall design of the images is also much more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangles or ovals. Much of the film can be spent playing finding the circle - an important aspect of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All of these geometric designs have a purpose - the story is about a boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the Book of Kells is a true illuminated Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings contained therein). ). The story of the film is not especially deep, but it is a very good fantasy story. Brendan is a boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to prevent the Vikings from entering. A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to illustrate. He also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest, within which a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score, almost as good as he did for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
