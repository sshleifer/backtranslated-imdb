I've seen this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure of the name of her character. I went to BYU with her and lost contact with her - her maiden name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. It is not listed in the credits. This production was excellent, a tear-jerker on all accounts, excellent performance of all. I think I do not even want to put it in the general category of 'acting', more like 'portraying with the incredible events that led to the opening of the skies to this final dispensation' ..... something like that. If someone worked with Kim or has a website or something, please let me know !!! She was fantastic in her role, by the way .... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
