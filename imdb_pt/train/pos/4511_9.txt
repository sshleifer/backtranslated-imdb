I just received the DVD release of this film during the holidays in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and has a powerful performance. The young man who plays 'Frits', the protagonist, has an incredibly open face that painfully mirrors the tragic events unfolding around him. <br /> <br /> Early in the movie we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is raised when the brutal director denies having assaulted the boy and suggests that he was his own father. <br /> <br /> The climatic scene in which Frits refuses to show any respect to the director; just standing up and repeating "Liar" while he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you probably will not forget. <br /> <br /> The only weak point in the movie is the rather clich√©d "Power of Flowers". teacher who uses all the "friend teacher" tricks in the book. Other than that I'm sure this is a movie that you really will enjoy.
