At first I did not like it that much, though I did. They did not include the third generation Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some actors were very different from what I imagined. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that if the film had been more faithful to the book, it would have been five hours and would be a little boring. Now I like it a lot, because my favorite characters are there when I portrayed them. Clara really does look like an Angel live, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined her like that, except that I did not mourn the whole thing. Esteban is finding enough. I never really liked his character, and although I was interested in him, I hated him a lot, especially when he beat Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting, and also has real story. <br /> <br /> The film is very good, especially considering it was a gringo movie based on a Latin American. book. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, do not you think?
