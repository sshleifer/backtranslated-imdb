Old horror movies are interesting, lots of screams, lots of screaming and lots of humor to accompany you. "The Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who tries to be a hero in his city. Going out on a date with your girl is pretty typical for all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same falling object in the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve helps him the best he can. When it comes to teen power, this movie really provides that. I know that most teens had their difficulties when they act, when the danger happens, they need to learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save mankind. When the city's adults learn the hard way about "The Blob," they need to learn to trust their teens and not let their behavior get the better of them. The oozing juggernaut was pretty beautiful during the day and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! As everyone prepares to end the threat, the city is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. I still like Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! 5 STAR RATING
