A stunned pre-coded with Stanwyck playing a noisy prostitute who sleeps to the top. These pre-coded movies really leave everything to nothing for the imagination. Stanwyck is excellent as Lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner / father who sold more than drink to his patrons (johns). After the old dies (good!) Barb heads to the big city for better things. She uses her feminine attributes to sleep to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that the actors improve with age and an acting coach. I loved the joke and the strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie fans and to watch Stanwyck who is big and beautiful as Lilly.
