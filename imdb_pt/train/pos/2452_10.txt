It's a good show, and I find it funny. Finally the bad Latin stereo types are gone! Thank you, Mr. Lopez! I love this show, and I started watching it three months ago. The whole concept of a Latino family TV show really surprised me. I'm surprised that Latinos finally have a good chance of being on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, it's funny, exciting, touchy and enjoyable.
