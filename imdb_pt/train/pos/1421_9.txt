This documentary makes you travel all over the world. It contains rare and impressive desert sequences. It shows you how diverse and how fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it. After all, his shadowy future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. This documentary, however, is a simplistic approach to such a serious environmental issue. It can, however, be easily seen by young children as it remains essentially descriptive. Scientists may be disappointed not to be a remake of Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," but frankly ... what a description !!! A question may then arise: is not it worth preserving the beauty of our world? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such beauty still exists despite the different pollution. Living in towns and cities, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of this nature. All things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called "EARTH".
