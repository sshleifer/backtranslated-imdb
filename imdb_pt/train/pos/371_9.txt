I remember when this movie went to the Oscars and did not win in any category. For the life of me, I can not remember what happened, but one thing I can say: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not convince me at all. <br /> <br /> Essentially, these are the trials and tribulations of a black woman when she is growing from a girl to a woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are necessary to see how much this woman endured. Along the way, we see other women who have had to endure their difficulties and walk with them for redemption. Whoopi Goldberg presents his best performance in this film. Danny Glover should also have been nominated at least for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanly, not like some side programs like the latest "Loved One" did. I encourage anyone of any race to watch this movie. 9/10
