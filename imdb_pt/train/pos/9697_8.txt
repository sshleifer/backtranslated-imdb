This is a really moving family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that) too (just think about the dog in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was clear bad training). The story of Paulie is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are very elaborate too. No more to say except that this is a GREAT MOVIE! <br /> <br /> My ratings: history 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND MUCH BETTER NOTICE!
