This is possibly the best crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is superb, especially Amanda Burton, character who goes from scary to sweet, from disruptive to sad and then some ... She does an incredible job balancing Rachels / Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who has lost a son, is so believable that it looks more like a real-life story than a drama. The other actors are also great, as they are in British TV / Cinema. The end, which I will not give, is fantastic, mainly because you can not get one ... (you'll understand what I mean after seeing it) It pays to buy and see more and again and if you are not touched by You're a cold-hearted person.
