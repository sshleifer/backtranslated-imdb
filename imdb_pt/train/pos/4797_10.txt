I've always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch has proven to critics that he has talent, style and artistic integrity to make films out of the surreal aura through which he has become known in the last decade. As much as the film is rated G, it is pure Lynch in style, rhythm and tone. The film moves in a masterfully hypnotic rhythm and is filled with scenes of genuine power and emotion. Cinematography is great, as you would expect from a Lynch film, and the transition assembly sequences are breathtaking. It's also refreshing to watch a movie where the characters are all friends, good-hearted people and not demotivated characters who are clearly labeled "good" or "bad." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful movie. performance as the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in a captivating performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small, but infinitely crucial role. With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving film, as he did in the '80s with "Blue Velvet" and "The Elephant Man." Critics seemed to lose faith in the last decade after he produced surreal films like 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway', but with this film he showed that there was method for FWWM and LH, and it seems that The Critics finally got their recent movie 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> 'Hetero Story' is for me one of the most moving movies I've seen. It's a love story about family, friendship, and kindness from strangers. I highly recommend it.
