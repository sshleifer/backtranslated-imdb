Do not mind the soundtrack, which is played so far. <br /> <br /> Still, Debra Winger is always interesting and although this was a previous role for her, she is very good as Cissy, girl from wrong. side of the tracks, lived in trailer with Bud, (Travolta), only to be replaced by a time by the slicker of the city Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous review on Scott Glenn, it is only used for plotting, released in the mix to create suspense; The story is predictable and invented. <br /> <br /> In addition, although I am from the East, many of us DO NOT like "Saturday Night Fever," although it has its moments, perpetual stereotypes are beyond criticism. At this point. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for Debra Winger; she's still so kind, and she's never had that Hollywood persona to which we are subjected by many actresses today. 7/10
