A Damsel in Danger is a delight because of the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine and an excellent supporting cast led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. A typically silly plot for an Astaire movie makes him as an American dance star in England, with Burns as his publicist and Allen his secretary. They concoct a story about it being a love bug with women left and right victims. He meets Fontaine, who is being held captive in his castle by a domineering aunt and a docile father. Silly lot. <br /> <br /> Great songs include A foggy day, Things are looking up, Good job if you can, and I can not be bothered now. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a brief (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in some dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including an inventive and fun play through an amusement park. Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Love Montagu, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the lead singer of madrigal. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of the delirious trio who sings Nice Work if you can. Your facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a scene thief in the W.C. Field Comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. Much abuse was accumulated in this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been horribly mischievous. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes Two more supposed disasters. Fontaine is good as Alyce and the dynamics allows the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with ample comic relief from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!
