Few movies can be seen nearly 60 years later, but remain as catchy as this. Technological advances do not date this classic love story. Special effects used are notable for a 1946 film. The acting is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a great job. The use of black and white / color enhances the creative nature of the film. He has not been seen on television for 20 years and few people know of his existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and waiting for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, by itself, "The Matter of Life and Death."
