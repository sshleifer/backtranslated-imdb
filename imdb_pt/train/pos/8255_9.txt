Fido is a cute comedy that deserves more recognition, especially considering the crap of the audience that should entertain us these days. As has already been pointed out, this is not a real zombie movie, but a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers. Although there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no blood and the way this movie is presented (feel good style in the 50s), I can not imagine anyone being really scared or turned off by Fido and his fellow sufferers. <BR> While the cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. The humor is not in your face, but rather subdued; There is a lot of attention to detail and I caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the film. This certainly is not a movie masterpiece, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie manages to present a black comedy that warms the heart.
