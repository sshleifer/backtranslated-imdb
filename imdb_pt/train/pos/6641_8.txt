On December 28, 1895, at the Grand Café in Paris, the history of cinema was written by itself, while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all singular, for a paying audience. 'La Sortie des Usines Lumière' was the first film to be played and I would like to be there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience. <br /> <br /> We started with closed doors from the Lumière factory. Apparently, as the image looks like a photograph, people thought they were just going to watch a slide show, not something they expected. But then the doors open and people are running home. First many women, then some men and a man on a bicycle with a big dog. When they are all out of doors close again. <br /> <br /> Whether this is the first movie or not (some say 'L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat' was the first recorded film Lumière), it is an impressive piece of old cinema. Being bored with this is almost impossible for several reasons. One simple reason: it's only fifty seconds long. But also for people who normally only like special effects movies, there must be something interesting here; you can not see historical things like that every day.
