Franco proves, once again, that he is the prince of surreal and erotic cinema. It is true that much of his work can be seen as a fun sleaze, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of letting his distorted creativity spread and gives us a movie that is both hypnotic and enigmatic while still retaining the delirious intrinsic eroticism in his work. The splendid score of Jerry Van Rooyen pulsates as the spectator is thrown from one bizarre scene to another as we follow the experiments of a stripper (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as a mysterious character say) be a demon reach an agreement with the world that it inhabits. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anyone with a passing interest in alternative cinema.
