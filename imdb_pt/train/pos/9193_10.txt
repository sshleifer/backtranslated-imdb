He is very loyal to the original manga of the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in the US), but it can still be enjoyed even if you have not read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong, independent woman that hurts like everyone else. However, because of her outside strength, she is afraid to show her inner feelings, and thus those around her hurt her with her blunt comments. The only one who really discovers her and who she can be at ease with is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something different than normal boring things with some wonderful actors / faces from J-Dorama (Japanese Drama) then this is definitely the series to watch ... and read!
