All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you're even remotely "PC" or do not have a seriously confused sense of humor then you probably will not get it. As sick and disgusting as this movie is, it's really a comedy and not a "horror" movie. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the boundaries of good taste and political correction to the most extreme limits imaginable, to the point where it becomes so out of control that it is comical, then you must see this to believe. This movie is so out of control that a big movie studio could not touch it with a 10-foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, the best and most extreme pieces of art come from underground. If you do not stick to the same old formula that people are accustomed to seeing, then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I've seen heaps of horrible, boring and z-grade Indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R. I also saw stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET movie like these two from Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out and explodes all the other "shock" movies completely out of the water, you really need to take a second look at the entire scene of the Indy movie. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy filmmaker can have when working on their own. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that even the other people who saw this movie and "hated" admit the fact that they laughed all the way through it. I do not think it's possible for anyone to get bored watching either of these two. So if you do not take everything that you see in conventional media seriously, and be able to laugh at a misanthropic psychopath wielding puppets that finally popped, you have to see this. You can just see it for the stand alone, cult classic that is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of over 1000 dvds.
