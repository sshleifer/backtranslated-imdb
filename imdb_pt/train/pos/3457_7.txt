This is Columbus who was directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career. It's nothing sensational, but a small hint of great things for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The film is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg's 70s movies and TV shows. So that means some characters tend to show some quirks and no, I'm not just talking about the character Columbus alone. The character's quirkiness that may be best seen in Spielberg's 1975 film, "Jaws." But aside from a few small hints of Spielberg's typical elements, you can not call this film an excellent example of a rising star. Not that it's bad, of course it's not, but as I said before, it's also not sensational at all. <br /> <br /> This film began very well and very promising, but after its good opening, in which as always occurred the murder, the film became slower and monotonous to watch. Mole because it's mostly a Columbus movie by the book that has no memorable moments, not boring because it's a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a criminal story writer who murdered his writing partner showed a great and interesting potential. History, however, has not explored all its possibilities. At least that's the feeling that this movie left me. The movie was still good to watch, however, thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he is smarter than Columbo because of his mystery / crime. writing experience and trying to give you all kinds of possible suggestions, moving away from yourself. But of course Columbo knows best and he is his number one suspect from the first moment, but as always plays the game. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and uses a good camera position and editing. It's funny to see that most of this was consistent with Spielberg's later work, especially some of the camera angles. <br /> <br /> A good and perfectly watchable Columbus movie, but do not let the name of Spielberg attached. to raise your expectations for this very highly. <br /> <br /> 7/10
