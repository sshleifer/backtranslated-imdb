My college professor says Othello might be Shakespeare's best drama. I do not know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the movie. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not direct, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can interpret Shakespeare as well as British actors can do. Not that there was a British vs. about this. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves. In addition to other tragedies of Shakespeare, it is the question of race. Something that exists since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and shown the complexity of their union. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak with jealousy and fears losing it to a non-Moorish man like Cassius. It's a great scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the ending. It's just worth watching. I think they've edited many of the lines for 2 hours, but they always edit Shakespeare.
