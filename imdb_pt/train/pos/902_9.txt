I thought this movie was really great because, in theaters in India nowadays, all you see is skin, music and bad acting ... in this movie, you can see some tradition, ethnicity and at least some decency .. Although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? that's what Indian cinema is all about! after watching this movie, at least you do not get headache because of overrated music or any violence, it's just the truth, teaches about love and of course, the care of the person you love during life ... I think it was an incredible movie ... Children can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be the profound certainty of India ... until all these rap hits, miniskirts and appearances have become part of this.
