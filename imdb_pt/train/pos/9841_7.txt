I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with 'real' actors and scenarios can not - although the effects of the computer are changing more and more. They can push the limits of satire ('The Simpsons'), taste ('South Park'), show ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in the Ice Age, as when we see a heterogeneous herd of now extinct mammals migrating across the field, talking like old friends. These scenes are a pleasure to watch, since we have the feeling of the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While the Ice Age is not as good as the best animated films of all time, it's a really fun movie. Sit down, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the beautiful backgrounds and the laughter. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred, the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to their tribe - for very different reasons. Along the way, of course, they have many problems. Also on the journey is Scrat, the most unlucky rodent in history, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: on glaciers, on dead trees, in ice caves. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable ending and a medium that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments, but some of the scenes, such as changing diapers or dodos, are hilarious, the animals are nice and look good. There is a very touching moment as well, when mammoth cave paintings come to life before Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> No need to see, but it's good for a fun hour or more. <br /> 7/10
