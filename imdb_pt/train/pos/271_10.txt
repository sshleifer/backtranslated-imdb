It's all about Mitzi. I loved her. And she did not look fantastic? I love these life Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. This is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to the commercial in the most annoying moments. Richard's character was completely creepy. I dated guys like that. Well, not quite so lol. I wish Zack had not been killed. He was cute and very easy on the eyes. I love these stalker-type stories. It always makes me stand up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband generally does not like these types of movies, but actually sat with the whole thing with me and really liked it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi does next!
