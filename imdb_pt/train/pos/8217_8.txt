With this film being the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only stars but produces and directs too, you know it has to be good. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best of the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, in addition to the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with some good action sequences, it does not have the gritty and gritty impact that the other three films do. This film captures all the excitement that makes a good Clint Eastwood movie, and has the quotes that make a good Harry Dirty movie. In Diry Harry is ".. Well, you, punk?"; in Magnum Force "A man knew his limitations"; and this is "Go ahead. Make my day". Also in this movie is good to see a change of scenery, as you get tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco in the other films of the series. With great acting from Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good direction from Clint, this is, in my opinion, the best Dirty Harry sequel of all time.
