I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never stops. The whole movie was done very well. The end is very good. Ontop of being full of action, they even have a surprise put there for you. When I saw what the movie was about the internet I was kind of not sure if I wanted to see this movie, but I feel like I'm a big fan of Luke Perry, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I took a chance, because this was a very fine movie though. It was very original. Whoever invented this film is applauded standing up for me. The performance was great. Luke Perry did a great job one more time. I give this movie the best rating.
