Vow to Cherish is a wonderful film. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, though different from the movie. It really made you wonder how you would respond if you were in the characters' shoes. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, EVERYONE! While production is not exactly the quality of Hollywood - without great special effects - yet, the values ​​and ideals portrayed more than make up for it. And the cast did a wonderful job at capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one becomes ill. <br /> <br /> You do not want to miss it!
