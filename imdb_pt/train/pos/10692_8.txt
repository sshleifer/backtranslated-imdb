Good, funny, direct story, great Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies she's in). This was a good "vehicle" for someone adept at comedy and drama, since there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, large closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another good unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). Perhaps they are very implausible. Ebert did not even publish a review for that. The big screwball comedies were obviously totally implausible ("Bringing Baby", etc.). If you've ever seen an implausible comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready for the 1930s. Bizarre. Birthday Girl is a movie that I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman may be the "killer app" for home videos.
