"An album of songs so old that everyone thinks it's new." This film has the elusive combination of rhythm and humor that sets some films apart from opening moments. And why not? Dame's imposing talent Judith Dench as a saxophone-playing widow with a street musician to help him tune the tunes, to Olympia Dukakis as the lively widow who lives in a Scottish castle at her many wedding weddings, Ian Holm as drummer who loved all members of a World War II swing band, all the girls (sort of). But wait, there's more. Add Leslie Caron on bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine on the lead vocals, finally, and the Blonde Bombshells are England's hottest band since The Beatles. Well, not true, but this movie is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the entire movie trying to gather the Blond Bombs to play at her granddaughter's prom. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how hard and brave it would be for a bunch of sex-genie women to step onto the stage in front of the Britney Spears generation after an act called "Open Wound." <br /> <br /> When the actresses end when they are 30, the second album of most bands is a compilation of great hits, and music with more than a month almost has no chance of being played, it is great to see a real talent, real music and really good movie comes, where else, the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I know I'm going to watch it many times, and enjoy it more each time.
