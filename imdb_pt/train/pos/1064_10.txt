I was just puzzled because damn FOX canceled the season3, although season 2 was not as good as season 1, which is really great !!! I like her so much that I even thought about buying DVDs on Amazon. (I failed !: I (I am a Chinese) student and it is inconvenient for me to get an international credit card and $) I just hope that FOX can bring back to DA someday somehow!
