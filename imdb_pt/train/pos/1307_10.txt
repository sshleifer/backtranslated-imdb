I really enjoyed watching this very well-played movie, especially by actress Helen Hunt and actors Steven Weber and Jeff Fahey. It was a very interesting film, full of drama and suspense, from beginning to end. I recommend that everyone take the time to watch this made for the television movie, it is great and has great acting!
