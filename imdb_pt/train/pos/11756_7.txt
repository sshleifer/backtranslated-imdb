The movie did not go well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a preview. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie to which the former players have moved. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with his film. paper. The best line of the movie at the beginning, by the character of Robin Jack: "I was this SOB!" Clean here not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> He was happy when he came to the DVD a few years ago in the wide screen / letter box format. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football player. fan or a real sports fan. But you do not have to be one to like this movie.
