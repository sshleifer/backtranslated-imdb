This is undoubtedly the best performance of John Thaw where he manages to eliminate any trace of his character from the Morse Inspector and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the TV screen. This is a well-made production that maintains its familiar vibration of vision, despite some very mature themes such as the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> However, it is the relationship between Tom and Willie Young who is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the evacuated boy from London and the grumpy old man with whom he develops-a true connection between grandfather and grandson. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this story did not happen. is not done with a larger budget, with a more established director, since he belongs to the big screen, not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Given the correct orientation, John Thaw would be celebrated around the world and bestowed many awards for his brilliant performance in this film. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was back then.
