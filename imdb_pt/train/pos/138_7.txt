I do not understand why the other reviews focus on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is writing and wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual pair in comics, they are definitely not stock types. Although it can not be said that their characters are well developed, it does not make them less funny. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was in HDNET and had subtitles for dialogue in Spanish, so this was certainly no problem. The use of Spanish gives more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated film, judging by the remarkably low score the IMDb members gave him. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of plain movies with higher scores and making lots of money at the box office are a lot less interesting.
