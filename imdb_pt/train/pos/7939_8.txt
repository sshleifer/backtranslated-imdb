It's good to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in Las Vegas on a whim and not only have to break the news to their children but also try to merge their respective families (each has two children). boys and two girls) in a cohesive family unit. What happens when the group, which includes four teenagers, two pre-teens and two young children, does a wonder at first, if there can be real happiness for Carrie and Jim. The fights between the children (and a little love affair between two of them) make us wonder if everyone can get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, which is a totally enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
