I was in a bad mood when I first saw this movie. For some reason, you clicked on all my levels, tensions in a family, loneliness and the lack of someone to share your life. It did not hurt that the person to share her life with was a girl as beautiful as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the soundtrack of this movie (very difficult to get). I loved it and hopefully one day it will come out in DV
