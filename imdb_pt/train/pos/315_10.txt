I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. Will highly recommend :) :) I only love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. I'm very sad that the soap is gone, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen, please, see. I loved the characters, the plot and how things ended up in the end for the villains. The only thing I would have changed is the end of Xica and her love of long life. I can not wait to see it again and recommend it. Xica was by far the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope everyone likes it too.
