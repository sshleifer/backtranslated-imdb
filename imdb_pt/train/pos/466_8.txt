This was a terrific historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Lujin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affections as his strange dance. Emily Watson is well in her supporting role as the sensitive lover Natalia. The relationship between chess and near madness is well explored by Gorris and by Nabokov's family concerns as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita"). are evident in this film. I think I'm going to read the novel now. It was a moving and tragic ending and it was difficult to keep a dry eye. Bright movie!
