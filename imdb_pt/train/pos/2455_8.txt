It's a very good film, but also Americanized in its predictability. Switch Kung Fu to football and the Turkish Family to a Pakistani, and you can watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost like a scene to the scene. A good feature that serves as the backbone of the film is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the road, starting with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a victory against himself as the master of Kung Fu emphasized several times. On a different level, Danish life reveals itself quite different from the image it has of outsiders: the non-indigenous immigrants who make up a large (indeed, the majority) of Danish citizens, the graffiti on the suburbs of Copenhagen, the insults of the immigrant girl at the beginning of the movie. All portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word Denmark.
