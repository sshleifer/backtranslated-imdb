I watched the last night after not having seen him for several years. It's actually a fun little movie with a lot of faces that you did not know were in it. Arkin shines as usual. Check out; you will not be disappointed. By the way, it was released on DVD and unlike its packaging, it is widescreen. The transfer is pretty weak, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)
