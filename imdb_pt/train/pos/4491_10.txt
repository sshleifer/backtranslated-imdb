I love this movie 'Spring and Port Wine'. I was born in Leigh, a town about 11 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. My workplace was daily via Little Lever via Farnworth, sometimes by bicycle, but by car when I could afford it. The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always out of money but who would always help if they could . Fred Dibnah was on the corner of Bromwich St. where my bed lay. If you have not seen the movie when it was first released then you might be forgiven for comparing it to a soap like Coronation St, well, I agree it's a soap, but then it was called ' Kitchen!' Watch this movie for the talented cast who shortly thereafter became household names of frequent roles on TV, I mostly watch the shots of the locality and the good factor of feeling people being poor but happy!
