I really did not expect much from this movie, but it was not bad; Actually, it was very good. This movie contained some of the funniest texts I've ever seen in a movie. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed a lot in parts. "The police considered my father's suicide a suicide. They said he fell into an elevator shaft. Now this movie is not for everyone, its idiot humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you hated these movies, I would probably recommend you avoid them. Overall it was a nice movie, about a group of aspiring superheroes, who ended up becoming real heroes in the end. It's an overrated comedy that many people probably have not seen yet because, like me before I saw it, I expected it to be rubbish. After watching this movie, I finally understood why this movie was able to put together such a famous cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even that Good Burger boy. It's because the Mysterious Man is full of great comic period 7 out of 10. A big surprise.
