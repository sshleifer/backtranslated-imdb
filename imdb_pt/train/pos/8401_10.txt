Love Trap is a "must see" independent film. When I sat down to watch the film, I arrived with low expectations, but I left with a blessing. The story is poetic, substantive and creative. The writer pulls you deeper and deeper into each scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters with which each one can identify. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider to be love. The film shows what love really is, action and not emotion. I was also impressed by the quality of the film and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two thumbs up and recommend it to all of all ages and all backgrounds.
