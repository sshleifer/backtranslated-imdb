Perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fit into any of the pitfalls commonly associated with the Bollywood film (ie, tack, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of Western movie themes / genres). Pakeezah is indigenous to the Subcontinent and authentic, almost Madame Butterfly-plot. Characters are well developed, direction, although sometimes not refined by today's perceptive and convincing standards. The means of speaking Urdu in the time of Pakeezah were masters of euphemism and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the time! The acting (particularly the "glances" and the dynamics between the characters) is a delight to behold, although the nuances may be lost among contemporary spectators or those unfamiliar with the customs and customs of Muslim India. <br /> <br /> With a captivating script is a beautiful soundtrack, enhanced by the protagonist exhibiting the eminent command of classical Indian dance (kathak). As is the case with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not leave the public without the spectator feeling at a memorable movie party. Pakeezah is certainly the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be parallel.
