I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty scary movie, though not as good as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it's different from what I remember because on the DVD I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak French and / or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also in the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are written differently than in IMDb. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is different in that the character of Elsie takes off his clothes and offers a naked one filmed in a scene and in another scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to kiss her in the bed and kiss her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. Would you like to know if there are any extra recordings that can be incorporated into an ultra-remastered edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been mended and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused images? <br /> <br /> In addition to the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the film is very good. There are not many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia hits them is good). Barbara Steele's chilling atmosphere and strange, exotic and seductive look make the film a lot better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele were not in this movie, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!
