Skip McCoy is a three times losing pocket of choice, unable to contain his instincts back on the street, he grabs Candy's purse on a subway train. What he does not realize is that Candy is carrying secret microfilms, microfilms that are of great interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller created an exceptional drama in the underworld of New York. City. Communist spies and shady government agents mingle to make Pickup On South Street a fascinating sight from the first minute to the last. Based around a story of Dwight Taylor called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy political agenda, something many at the time felt to have run out of, but focusing solely on their anti-communist tendencies is doing a great disservice. Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as Fuller directed, the main protagonist of one of them is the hero of the play, a thug and a shallow human being, his heroes are not born of love for their country, they are born of their stubborn line. It's a great achievement that Fuller created one of the best anti-heroes of the 1950s, and I'm sure he was very grateful to Richard Widmark's performance as McCoy, every cold and icy heart, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and is the heart of the movies. However, it is Oscar nominee Thelma Ritter, who takes the acting honors, her Moe is strong and as decadent as the characters around, but there is a tired heat for her that Ritter broadcasts majestically. <br /> <br /> It's a B movie in texture but a running movie, Pickup On South Street is a real and fun movie that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10
