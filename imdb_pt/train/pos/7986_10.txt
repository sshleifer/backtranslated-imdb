This is a great heart-breaking movie. It is by far the best I have ever seen portraying the current reality in Latin America ... kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy cops and heartless disorder toward innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most moving performance of his career in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an incredible young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken lights the screen for me like no other actor. I'd love to see more of both. The authentic sites are remarkable. The work of the camera is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, which makes it even more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I recommend this movie.
