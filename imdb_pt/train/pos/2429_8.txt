If you loved Deep Cover, you may like this movie as well. Many of the poetic interludes that Fishburne recites in Deep Cover are from the lyrical screenplay of "Once In the Life," a cinematic adaptation of a play Fishburne wrote. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie that's all Larry, all hot and all in the flesh. Of course there are firearms and illicit substance use, after all, it's a kind of gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story is touching, even a bit on the side of the girl movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you sneak into the night or hang out in a club, you will have the proper impact of tight sets (echoing meteborically be stuck in life). Full of hopes and complex relationships, this movie is very strict ... all the feeling mirrored in the set-dressing and the camera photos. GOOD JOB!
