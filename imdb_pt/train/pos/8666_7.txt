Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking mafioso who surrenders to the police or plays illegally (for reasons that seem to me obscure). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who frequents a billiard room and spends his free time envying Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where they form a bond that may not be well-befriended, but will be for now. This movie came to me under the title "Frank and Tony," which is disappointing because I see an alternative name like "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would have helped sell the movie most effectively. I presume it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" but what do I know? I watched right after another Italian criminal film, "Violent Professionals", and I must say the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> The Italians have always lagged behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this film. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie, which unfairly lowers it to a b movie (or worse). With a cleaner sound and picture, this could have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) better than the average and unlike "Violent Pros" the plot is pretty clear - not many minor characters. <br /> <br /> If you like Mafia movies or crime movies you should try. A film about the Mafia that is actually from Italy (the more authentic you want it?) Is the maximum you can ask for. Of course, it's not "The Godfather," but it should not be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, heavy action movie ... like "Hard to Kill with a Vengeance" from the bandits' point of view. Well, all right, not really. <br /> <br /> At least this movie made me want to check out other films by the director and the main cast. Films besides "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual cult movies. What's more fun than discovering a lost classic?
