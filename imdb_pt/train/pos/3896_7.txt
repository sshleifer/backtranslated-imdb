Some people loved The Aristocrats and others hated it, often walking in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard are probably not going to be that extreme - if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and have a vocabulary that makes, say, enough use of the word "f" your program would be a long beep displayed on the television network. Many of Izzard's fans are so dedicated that they see no flaws in their performances. On the other hand, I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest, but also, for the most part, funny and, in some ways, quite hilarious. It has a way of connecting routine references at the beginning of the program to its later routines. He is not a storyteller. He's not a joke. He's not a frantic fantasist like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work and some of them - a routine with the San Francisco and Alcatraz cable car, for example - are completely bland. He has a way, however, to pass gracefully through the routines on the flop and extend the ones that connect. I gave this performance a 7 and could be persuaded to increase to 8. But a 10? No way.
