My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I always loved horror movies) and even then I liked it. The atmosphere is amazing and the story is original and entertaining. I particularly love the scenes in which the trailer is under attack in the desert. The rocks are really compelling for a low budget movie. The acting is above average for these types of films and the music is weird. This is definitely a uder-rated gem. I recommend to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies, early eighties, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Massacre Hospital", and "Return of the Aliens, the Deadly Spawn ". Definitely a classic !!
