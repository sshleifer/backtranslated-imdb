I may be getting ahead of myself here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I watched it piece by piece at TCM last night, the question comes to the fore: why did they do it? putting their lives in danger, many of them died on the journey, why would they embark on such a dangerous journey to life, only to find food for their animals when they came to the land of milk and honey? they stay there Would you jeopardize your life and that of your entire community, only to find food for a herd of cattle? As dangerous as it is, doing it just for that purpose shows the innate simplicity of these types of people. Risk death for a cow? Better them than me!
