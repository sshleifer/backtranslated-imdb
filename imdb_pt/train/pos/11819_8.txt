I just took this on DVD and watched it again. I love the bright colors against dark images. Not a big fan of Beatty, but this is a great popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and well, this movie marked the period when Madonna was her sexiest absolute. I wish she had stayed with the "Breathless" look for a while longer. The first great role of Charlie Korsmo, plus "What about bob?". The makeup effects were cutting edge and still hold most of it. Beautiful scenery and humor carry you directly into a comic book environment. The cars, the wardrobe, the buildings and even the street lights and a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with a lot of red look a little annoying, since they tend to blur a bit. I just wish Beatty had the chance to make a sequel. All in all, a few hours of fun.
