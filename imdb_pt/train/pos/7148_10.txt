This movie is one that I strongly recommend. It is about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who is unjustly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a boys detention center. There he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. While there, he meets the other camp boys (Zero, Magnet, Axilla, Lula, X-Ray and ZigZag). They are all digging, not to "build charactor" but to discover the treasure of Kate Barlow. Throughout the film (and book) Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself and more about digging holes. I give this movie a 9.5, because, I'm very picky when it comes to books for movies, (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY). But still, it went very well.
