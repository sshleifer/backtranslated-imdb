I have to totally disagree with the other commentary on this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the film and do not detract from the plot, in addition, I loved how this movement was different from Crouching Tiger, because this time the action of the sword had no moorings and most of the time you can see the action closely . <br /> <br /> I think the Western public will be very confused with two scenes, one involving a monk trying to burn alive and the other about the villagers singing that is the end of the world. The scenes mentioned are derived from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a whim on the Japanese calendar ... people at that time really thought the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has the action, story and visuals to hypnotize any onlooker. I firmly believe that, with a skillful edition, it can be sold in the US. My only complaint is the last fight scene (I can not give anything - sorry).
