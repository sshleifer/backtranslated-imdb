When you see the DVD cover, you're convinced it's a cheap Class B cheap, a $ 1,000 movie in someone's backyard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is quality material and very good. It's a comedy and intelligent. It's also very touching on some points, with a good point of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (this looks great), the actors are known, the direction of the film and the sets are great. It's incredible. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against the guy, is great, like "Helen Robinson," the wife resembling June Cleaver; Billy Connolly is great as the good-hearted zombie scream "Fido"; Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a joke that is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy", and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as parents (check) are excellent, also K'Sun Ray as a young man "Timmy Robinson , "should not be overlooked, either. In fact, it probably has more lines in the movie than either. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story, it will seem so stupid that few of you will watch. You just have to take the word of the people you liked and found a very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor; an appreciation of the absurd.
