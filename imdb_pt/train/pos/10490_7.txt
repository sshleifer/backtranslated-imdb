Yet another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story told and acted well. Brenda Blethyn gives a layered and heated performance as the recently widowed and financially limited Grace, skillfully aided by a solid supporting cast. The letter of the "peculiar little town" is played to the fullest, similar to many TV series and movies that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). Like the aforementioned, this film makes use of an incredibly beautiful rural setting, in this case the coast of moist and wild Cornwall. <br /> <br /> Some viewers may find that wholesale acceptance of cannabis use is a little challenging, others may find it ending up a little cute and safe. But it's nice fun for sure.
