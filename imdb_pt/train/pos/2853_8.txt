I finally saw this movie today after renting it on Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is totally original. Yes, maybe the characters have not been fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. Instead, we are treated in the eyes of the director, his vision of what history is. And that does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want to. I believe that Sabu had to influence the director of 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I loved the way the three leaders COME the pretty woman on the street to distract them momentarily. I really need to see this other director's work because this movie really intrigued me. If you want a view, culture, sturm und drang, go elsewhere. If you want a laugh, camera move and criminal hilarity, look here.
