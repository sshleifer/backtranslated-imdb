It's good to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as convincing as a simple but nice daughter to Robert Farnsworth, who finally, in his last role, manages to show what an excellent actor he was. It's hard to believe this is a David Lynch movie. It is slow and uniform, sweet and moving. One of the best, unless you enjoy car chases, sex scenes and violence.
