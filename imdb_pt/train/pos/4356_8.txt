"The Thing About My Folks" came as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, and based on a screen of one of its stars, Paul Reiser, proved to be a pleasant moment in the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what the outcome will be, this is a journey of discovery where Ben meets his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, not the mythical figure he keep in mind. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a vehicle for its star, Peter Falk, and he runs off with the film, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most affectionate actors who has worked in films at this time and in recent years, is an actor of such stature, it must be taken into account. As Sam Kleinman, Ben's estranged father, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not only by Ben, but it seems like the whole family and his wife are forty-seven. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, the matriarch of the Kleinman clan, runs away, everyone panics because this woman, who is the strong family figure, is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she went, Sam appears at Ben's house confused when suddenly feels abandoned by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to look for a home he wants to buy so he can take his own family from Manhattan to the country. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to relate to his father in a way he never knew, because the old man always designed an indifferent figure for his youngest son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how man was misunderstood by his children. Sam's love for Muriel encompasses the many years in which they meet; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is magnificent in the movie. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes that his life is about to change for the worse. Mr. Falk shines like the older man and there is never a false move in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of Paul Reiser, we must confess that, like Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his father find out how much they both have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is seen only at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the mother runs away. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style. The film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham and the excellent musical track of Steven Clay. Ultimately, the film shows a major team effort between its director, DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it to the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film is clearly aimed at an older audience, it should appeal to anyone.
