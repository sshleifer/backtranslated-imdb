It's a colorful horror movie. That's about it. <br /> <br /> It has the mysterious element that SCREAM has become so popular in horror movies, but I never care about these things. Finding out who the villain is is not so interesting considering that the clues are all misleading. <br /> <br /> The death scenes were inventive and deafening, bringing back memories of horror films from the '80s like Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this movie is that it is difficult to identify the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like horror movies will not like this movie. As simple as that. I really liked it and I plan to watch it again while I look forward to more of it. <br /> <br /> --MB
