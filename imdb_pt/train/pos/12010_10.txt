Warning: soft spoilers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith's story stands out as an astounding-and moving-episode in the history and history of world religion. This film portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revered as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. I have so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public viewing. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is first shown to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped show the Smith family cohesion and the bond between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayers that led to what Mormons call the First Vision were portrayed in an interesting way. . The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable marks of nails in His hands. Rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is tempered at least a little by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This film does not clearly map events in the history of the Mormon Church, but simply jumps from scene to scene. This is not a criticism - simply a note about style. <br /> <br /> The practice of tar and plumage is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph gives a sermon on the Savior's love with a scar on his face. of being recently attacked. <br /> <br /> The film masterfully portrays the joy and growth of Mormonism as a childish church, while at the same time the deepening opposition that spreads to the heights of local governments. The film shows many scenes of Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments portraying his relationship with Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his ferocious love for his wife, his infinite love for children, his intelligence, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and his compassion. While Joseph and Hyrum go to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters throughout the film, whose lives were touched by Joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce which was already seen, but create the final scene to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and the spectators are left to reflect on the events they have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I assumed it was done by the Church to present Joseph Smith to nonmembers. I do not think that's the case anymore, though I expect the film to do just that. As a person inside, I think the film is a celebration of Joseph and reinforces the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how strangers are going to see the movie - whether they will simply see it as propaganda, an epic story of an American religious man, or whatever. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully filmed, familiar, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in the light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - that moderns take for granted.
