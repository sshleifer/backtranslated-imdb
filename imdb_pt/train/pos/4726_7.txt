The origins of this movie are a mystery to me, as I only know as much as the IMDB did before I leased it. I presume that before "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the countless pilots who never reached networks, cables or others. The new title of "Kill Shot" is released comically in the opening sequence, the first of many fast tracks that this has never been a movie. The quick cuts, the melodic "Melrose Place" music and the short 2 seconds of spontaneous photos from the lead actors let you know what you're going on. <br /> <br /> And I do not care at all. I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie beyond the farce of SciFi Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that's another review). After looking at IMDB, my roommate and I assumed that the pilot was dragged after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards' own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They did a sex scene involving a smaller character to achieve the coveted status of censor - coveted in the video rental sections of the suspense. Either way, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the softcore porn / suspense section. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's fun. I hate spoiling the fun of saying you're a TV pilot, though. That was the biggest draw while watching it - when you expect a movie and make a TV show, the differences between them become clearer than normal. <br /> <br /> Would I rent this again? No. Do I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And his meager attempts to reach all demographic data would have done well in the mid-1990s. Token black guy (who is gay to avoid the taboo of interracial dating), Asian token (Japanese, I assume by the name Koji) more adept at science and computers than at talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina pre-medical student who has everything for her except her family's bank account - this show probably would have done just fine. <br /> <br /> But like a movie, it just rocks me. <br /> <br /> I gave 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask for for rent.
