I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion and seemed so real that I could empathize with the characters. Every time I watch, the end makes me cry. I really can identify with the character of Busy Phillip, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all schools should show this movie, maybe it will stop people from wanting to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those who were affected by any school shootings. <br /> <br /> It's one of the biggest movies of all time.
