Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker come together to play all of their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream." Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked like: all the thin, long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and were, for the most part, good things. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now in their early 60s and can still sing and play at a high level. as this wonderful disc of DVD shows shows us. I've always been extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, none of whom I had not seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so thin he looked like a quick freak near death. Now he looks healthy, fit and his drumming was solid. Bruce looked a little downcast, but his voice is great, as good as ever, and a pleasure to hear in those old songs. This is just great stuff and featuring guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this program for being discreet. I do not agree with this. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, "Spoonful", was excellent, the highlight of the show for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
