This movie is great. if you have the chance to see it, you should rush to see it. although the film has almost nothing to do with its original 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has that way about him where he can say anything anyway and make it look great. If you thought Pulp Fiction was good with swearing (if you saw it), then you should also see Scarface to see another angle of how an actor can tell them. (it's really cool) <br /> <br /> Even though the movie has a lot of action and the storyline moves very fast in time, not keeping the aspect ratio in real time correct, it's still easy to keep up with, but you should keep eyes open at all times to not miss anything. Personally, I found that watching this movie three hours ago feels like a breeze, it's actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the films that is so well represented and directed that you not only forget that this movie was made in the 80's, but it really makes you cheer for the bad guy ... "So say good night for the bad guy "
