This is a movie that was very well done. I had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and was waiting for its release! Congratulations to the director and all the actors. The support cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take it to the top. As everyone else says, the last part of the movie is fascinating. Katie Cassidy did an incredible job with her character, and she had not done much work when this movie was made. She has quite a career ahead of her. I was amazed at his performance. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, questioned my values ​​in life and priorities, and I am a better person for it! A great message is in the movie. Release it for all to enjoy!
