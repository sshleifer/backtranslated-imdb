Okay, frankly, I saw the previews for this movie and I thought to myself, what are the producers thinking? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, they both had the kind of chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's mood matched Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he interpreted the psychopath very well, contrasting with the calm delivery of threatening situations to David's life. Overall, I was very impressed with the development of writing and the character. I gave it 8 stars.
