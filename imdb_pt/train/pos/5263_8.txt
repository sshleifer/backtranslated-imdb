Netflix should mention this little feature about Silk Stockings information. Superior in every way so the fluff is overproduced. This had much better Cole Porter songs and a lot more energy. Silk socks turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred was getting too old for this sort of thing, though the dances and Cyd are lovely. I'll be watching the Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre sick while making silk socks - does he appear to be very passive in the most active and least-threaded numbers? Very happy that I ran through Paree - Paree by pure accident. It made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "singer and dancer" is pure joy.
