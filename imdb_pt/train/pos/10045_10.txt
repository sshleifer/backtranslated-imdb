I think it's so incredible that even after all these years, we're still talking about this movie! Obviously, this movie was not so bad or people did not even talk about it. I personally enjoyed this movie immensely, and I still do! I think this movie is not for everyone, but it certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this movie is "overrated" or "exaggerated" ... well, we only have the audience that goes to the movies thank you for it! lol * You see, there are CRITICAL writers / articles that make a "HUGE" movie or a "HIT" with the general public going to the movies. People make the film a huge success. With the Titanic, everyone was amazed. Let's face it, a movie like this had never been done before. At least not with the kind of special effects needed to actually capture the essence of the sinking ship. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron marked the actual sinking of the ship in the movie with REAL sank on that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for God's sake combined! <br /> <br /> Give this movie time to yourselves! Critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie really came out and people started listening to WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertising you think) that this was a good / decent movie / worthy to be seen, then everyone started going to theaters to see this movie ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times more! So, I really would not say that this movie was "overdone" ... at least not like the MATRIX recharged buildup, or the HULK is being "overdone". there is! Critics did not even think the Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that was needed to make this gigantic movie. However, the money from the movies took care of this 200 million budget and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this movie may not be for everyone. Do not say that this movie sucks just because of romance! This is the sexist thing I've ever heard! Not liking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it ... the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate ... it was the GIGANTIC ship! I think all the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet have done a good job. It's not your best job (I've seen much better work of both), but it was not the worst I've seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
