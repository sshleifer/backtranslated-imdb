This show has come so far. At first, everyone in Eric's cast for Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, new faces, and just looking at what they were doing. They got the show and it was a success. It's one of the best shows of all time and it's probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see this done, but if they finish this show, I hope that the end of the series comes out with one of the biggest explosions that any season finale ever had. I do not care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Come down swinging, take one last punch. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they are, let everyone know it will end, as in Friends, and let the ending be huge. I tell Donna and Eric to get married, I tell Hyde and Kelso to fight and become friends again, I say something interesting happened between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it will not work out for him . JUST CLOSE OFF THE BIG SERIES MEN! <br /> <br /> This Show of the 70's will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I would like to have you as friends. You are the best! 10/10 ...
