You have to be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought this was very well done. Direction and cinematography were engaged without becoming a distraction. The angles, settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmare world in which the main character was captured. Many amazing and memorable images of the film stay in your mind long after the end (always a sign of a good director).
