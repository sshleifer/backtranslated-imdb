I saw this movie. This movie is the best according to the current need. Marriage dowry is the biggest problem nowadays. In stating this problem, this movie is the best. In this film, the Indian values ​​are very well presented. The youth of today must understand this problem. There is less population of girls. And because of this dowry problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there is no girl, is not far away. So bear in mind this statement, the youth of today must understand that we can not take dowry in weddings.We have to learn from this movie that the dowry does not should be taken. And if we understand this problem, then we can see the new trend in society. This is the great change in society.
