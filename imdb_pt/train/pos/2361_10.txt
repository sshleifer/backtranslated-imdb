I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an intensive care medical clinic. Over the years, I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have participated in numerous conferences on bloodborne pathogens, and have seen several patients become seriously ill due to pathogens induced by transfused blood. I also heard several Witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field I have never really seen it happen, leaving the question, "is it really irrational to refuse blood transfusions or is the community benefiting greatly from the battle on this issue? "The question for Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thanks for this movie and allowing comments on it.
