How many of us want to be able to throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Let's Dance? It's not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognizing what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a pretty girl leaning against a window of a dance academy. He is fascinated by it and eventually signs up for dance lessons. He is ashamed to dance and is afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dance lessons from his classmates and family. <br /> <br /> There is a hilarious scene in the men's bathroom in the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a fellow worker who also dances, are interrupted by practicing a few dance steps. There are many other funny and warm scenes. <br /> <br /> The ending is not a fairy tale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good. <br /> <br /> This film helped me understand Japanese. the people a little better. It's a hot movie and very interesting to see.
