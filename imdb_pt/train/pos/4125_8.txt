I loved to watch Sea Hunt back in the day, I was in grammar school and was going home to do my homework and at 4:30 I would be ready to watch Sea Hunt and Mike Nelson in their adventures. underwater. I loved ! He took you to a place not very accessible at that time, under the great blue sea. Pre '' Thunderball '' or even before Cousteau became commonplace, there was Mike Nelson awakening the children's imagination. I would be willing to bet that more than a few kids have developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences for watching this show. Underwater photography has also progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated through watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
