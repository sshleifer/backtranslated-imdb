This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family liked it. The animation is great and easily demonstrates that there are many producers who create movies that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> One difference from Disney is that this Dreamworks movie does not feature a wise side kick for comedy relief. And there are no sudden moments when the characters begin to sing. I'm sure a scene at the beginning of the movie would not appear on a Disney picture: the birth of the Spirit. But this is done with taste and is not offensive at all. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not misunderstand me. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of great fare. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to watch again. I had the same feeling. I thoroughly recommend it.
