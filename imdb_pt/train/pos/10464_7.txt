For all of you who do not speak Swedish: the Swedish title [original] of this film; "Rånarna" translates to something in the line of "The Robbers". This fact is the main problem I have with the film because it is not really about the thieves. It's about a young woman working for the Swedish police who's investigating thefts. An ordinary secretary that one would think, but this girl is on the field, taking things into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting at one of the thieves ... Exactly: We've seen this before. The fact that there is a pretty interesting twist in the middle of the path does not help much, since the ending is as cliché as the first two-thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> What saves him from being just another mainstream movie is the fact that he is masterfully executed in every way, that the actors are as good as they are and do not overdo it and that the director really can keep it as exciting as most of the story. <br /> <br /> One thing I really loved about this movie is the fact that music sets the right mood when it's needed, but it's missing for the rest of the time, which gives a good sense of reality to shootings and car chases spread throughout the film. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who are usually labeled sadly hurts the film, since you know he will not just play the heroine's boyfriend and be a supporting character in the background, but that's something you have to neglect. <br /> <br /> All in all it's a fun movie that steals more money in your plot than the time of you. 7/10
