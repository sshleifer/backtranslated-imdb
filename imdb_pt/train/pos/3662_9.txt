This is a very strange movie - and that's NOT a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realist movie about the homeless and a fairy tale. I'm sure some might find this movie a little too weird, but I loved it. Again, this director gathers a wonderful cast of ordinary people (not actors) and gets a great overall performance. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point to make - this simply does it in a very absurd way. Ignore the extravagant special effects - after all, it was done in the early 50's and the special effects are not very important anyway (or at least should not be in movies). Instead, sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride. Unless you're a total grump, you'll have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I've reviewed this movie for the first time, I've seen another film directed by DeSica which is absolutely a must-see and it's THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US. Although not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, a great movie, however.
