The main reason to see this movie is Warren William, who is in his best shape as shyster campaign manager. He is electrical, constantly finding ways to deceive the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the greatest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he never got what he deserved. Bette Davis as her girlfriend also shines in an underwritten paper. Personally, I have not found Guy Kibbee as sure as the candidate William and the others are trying to foist on the public. He looked more like an empty screen than a person. I'd rather see a real character emerge instead of a non-character. The story itself is implausible, silly and cliche. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth watching.
