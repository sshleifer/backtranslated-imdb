I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! Why did I only get to see this great movie 3 years after the release? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmed my heart. Big moment. It's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway: <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent throughout the film - from the lead role to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogues are and the film is perfectly directed and edited. <br /> <br /> I think the films of the Farrelly brothers are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they are deeeeeep! They talk about what life is (I will not tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie has told me what relationships are: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: Free him, let him be - try to share the passion and always be faithful to each other. <br /> <br /> I'm not a sports hater, but I'm definitely an ignorant sportsman. But in this movie - the vibrations catch you. I could smell the atmosphere of baseball. Finally, this movie has explained to me what being a sports fan might mean to you and what cool fan families should be out there. Thank you, Pete & Bob! <br /> PS: If you have not seen it, check out the KINGPIN!
