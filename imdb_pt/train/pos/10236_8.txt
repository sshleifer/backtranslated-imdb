Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for those who like Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the films is definitely the bastard son of these two strange parents. As for the other characters, they are familiar transformations of similar stereotypes of action films. Where this movie is original is in the mix of Hong Kong's traditional movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately, this did not happen with the movies he did in Hollywood.
