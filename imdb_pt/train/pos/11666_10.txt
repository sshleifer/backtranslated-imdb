KELLS SECRET may be the most exquisite movie I've seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Though stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the incredible opening sequence of 2D) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background / layout and a wealth of colors that is a feast for the senses. KELLS is so luxurious - almost gothic in its layout (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in the overall general outlook, ornate in its lighted and celtic design, but the characters are so simplistic and attractive - and everything works just fine. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you know them. You are so attracted to every detail of history and to every brushstroke and pencil. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended teams) have managed with this VERY small budget / crew movie, is absolutely amazing. The wave of support among our animation community is phenomenal. This movie is breathtaking and the buzz among our colleagues in recommending this movie is spreading like fire. Congratulations to KELLS for their many accolades, their nomination for Annie and their current pre-qualification for the Oscars. They are all very well deserved nods, in fact ...
