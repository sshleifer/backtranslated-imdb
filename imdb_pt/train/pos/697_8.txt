This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a low budget, it was well done; Because I am insomniac, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleep problems have never been so intense or disturbing. Well-directed, well-represented, of a subject that I have not seen much in theaters, lighting and perfect fit for the movie scenario. There are few perceptible errors, but they can be intentional; you'll see after watching the movie. The movie is very personal and worth watching twice. No movie is perfect, but a Hollywood version could not improve the story. in all, 8/10.
