That 80's soundtrack neglected. I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs, but when watching the movie, that seemed to embody everything that was the cheese of the 80's. Clearly, movies that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was Texas's bad accent. Compare that with the Friday Night Lights. I suggest watching the Cocktail and Wiggling Foolish to start getting into the movie's duel. Also, as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an incredibly bad movie. I was so shocked to realize that I had never attended. Another strange movie of this genre would have to include the Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember that all these big stars played big roles in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
