This is a short film by fans who pretends to be a preview of a new movie that combines Batman and Superman! It's the kind of movie fans love and watch in places like ComicCon and it was made by the same person who did BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> With regard to this movie, I could easily choose separate. Of course the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, this was done on a tight budget and for a fan film this is amazing. I was particularly impressed with Superman - he was not a short guy! If only this were a preview of a real movie - they would have fans lined up from Omaha to see it. Good job.
