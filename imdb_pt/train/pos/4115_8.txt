This is one of the strangest movies I've seen recently. This is because it looks less like a movie and more like an experimental movie. Kurasawa's experiment was to catch a variety of people living in a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their usually hard stocks. Not every episode is depressing and tough, but overall this is definitely the tone. Let's see ... we have a case of incest / rape, attempted homicide, wife swapping, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating spoiled fish, a man with severe depression (he never talks during the movie and seems very a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car driver and spends all his waking hours driving his street car down a path among the piles of garbage, a man married to a (I think I liked her character more than the incestuous rapist!), etc., etc. In fact, it's depressing enough to look almost like a Ingmar Bergman movie in Japan when Bergman made MANY films that tended to deal with the mental illnesses and the hopelessness of life.It is surprising that after making this movie Kurasawa tried to kill himself?! So I liked it? No. It was not a fun experience.But it was a very good movie done that definitely kept my attention and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was like watching a train accident - you do not WANT to see all the carnage, but you can not help but watch! Of all the vignettes, I think the older man who tended to look at everyone and who did not really seem to fit (he was very well adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump) might represent Kurasawa himself. Perhaps. Do not know. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a variety of Kurasawa movies and have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this a watch. However, DO NOT make this your first experience watching your movies - it sure will scare many viewers!
