<br /> <br /> There's a canon of STAR TREK - a lot of it. From canon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> The ENTERPRISE pretty much disregards the ST canon. A pitiful fact for serious fans of long time. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the early episodes of TOS and retro from there - but no. <br /> <br /> Phase guns, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS. An old Starfleet laser gun, a slow effect of carrying gold spots - was what I expected to see. In addition, I did not expect to hear pure sound effects based on TNG-like beeps, but away from the sound effects of TOS. <br /> <br /> In the older vision of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect - a bit of the old Navy of Earth. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking contempt for classification. There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in ENTERPRISE. <br /> It is good that Captain Archer is not sure about the needs of the Universe (quite unlike Kirk, who has never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but within the company everyone looks the same. Not professional, insecure, more distant from the sense of formal military service than what is found in any ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> The casual music of opening country music announces the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of a major military vessel. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE seeks to show us a fun and warm exploration of human relationships instead of leading us to a historic, courageous exploration of space. <br /> <br /> I would have chosen Adrian Paul to play Captain and an older human to be the doctor. Still, I liked the actors most of the time. Linda Park, an excellent ballroom dancer at Boston College, is sure to perform well. The characters that make up the team seem to have been created with care. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE begins its career stronger than the last three series of the STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
