Spielberg's first dramatic film is not disappointing. It's a beautifully flawless film in the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all films that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be run by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic, despite the fact that it was based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. E, usually he is just himself during most of his films. But in that, it completely branches out and is another person for the first time. But the endurance performance of the entire movie comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She's great as Celie. You will never forget these characters after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I've heard that the musical version will also be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's as good as this, because this is a movie that should not be missed.
