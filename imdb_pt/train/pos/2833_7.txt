Just re-watched this movie after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and got this movie in South Beach at the old Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where it is! it was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this movie is now an old and tired re-hash of the war between the generations. However, he got a place in time that is just a souvenir. It's really interesting to see the fashions fashions, the old Vegas, a skinny Don Rickles, a network of smokers and an opening song. The acting was decent, the script a bit out of fashion, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be where it is for you, but for me it was still a pleasant and fun journey down the memory road.
