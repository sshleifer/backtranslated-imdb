This was a great movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There were so many things to connect, so many beautiful images and a lot of compassion on the things that were not said. I was completely entertained and I had a feeling of exuberant joy, just as I am when I end up with any story of Tom Robbins. Now I have not read this particular book by Robbin, so I do not know now how this fit, but I can not imagine that this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The film has left a lot to you if you set it, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, dreaming of the details. <br /> <br /> For all of you who have said that this was the worst movie ever, I pity the little left of the light that darkens in their hearts. Far from the worst of all, this movie was glorious. Long live the crane screaming.
