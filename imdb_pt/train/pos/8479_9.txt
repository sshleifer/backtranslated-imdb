Watching this several times as a child was a great experience 15 years ago, and now that I've met her again, she still has a cinematic experience like few others.

Although I still hold myself as an adult, I was lucky enough to have learned from it many times years ago. Trying to find him today is quite difficult. . . but believe me it's worth no matter the age. Anime fans, especially, will find this a great entry for Masami Hata's filmography. With stunning artwork and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a worthwhile experience. While some of the lyrics are not so hot when recorded in English, the musical score is captivating. But even the dubbing is much better than much publicized today. Unfortunately, it was depleted in the mid-1980s by RCA Columbia Home Video, and received no new format version that I know of, at least in the US. Look hard for this and you will be quite satisfied! It is an artistic landmark, intense, pleasant and important in Japanese animation.
