I have to see the whole movie last night and I found it very exciting. It was at least not like teen movies that crop up from time to time. The search for the killer and the 'partner' relationship between the hero and the so-called thugs were parts that I liked about the movie. Also, I remember being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie. It's exciting. Maybe some time later, I can watch the movie again. ..
