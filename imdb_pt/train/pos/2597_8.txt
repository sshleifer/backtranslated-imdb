Ulysses as a film should in no way be compared to the novel because they are two entirely different entities. However, having said that, the film still manages to keep many of the elements that made the book work, but as it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to pull the flow of consciousness. I think this is the best movie they could have done with the material ... and this is from someone who routinely talks about movies as not their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still fun.
