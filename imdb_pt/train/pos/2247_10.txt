I'm disappointed with the lack of posts on this amazing and effective little movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in "Blow" Writes, directors and stars of Ted Demme. <br /> <br /> I will not give any plot point like the movie (at least to me) It was very exciting not to know anything about it .. If you have a Netflix account, or have access to a store video that would take you ... I strongly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun and sometimes very thought-provoking creation. <br /> <br /> Mollà's direction is very impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with incredible images and a great leadership performance spoken in beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" (God is in the air) is an incredible movie that you can show your friends. <br /> <br /> SEE.
