At this point, it seems almost unnecessary to state that Jon Bon Jovi offers a strong, strong and uninterrupted performance like Derek Bliss. His acting ability was previously established by his acclaimed critique in other films (The Leading Man, without looking back). But if anyone is still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can act well and this is expected of him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who sings hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I usually did not watch a horror movie. I've come to expect them to focus on a sensational gang instead of dialogue and plot. What pleased me the most about this movie was that there really was a viable plot being carried forward. Blood is not so much as becoming the focus of the movie and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with budgets of higher technical effects. So gore fans may be disappointed, but fans of the story will not. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571, where the dialogue sits in the back seat, we get a chance to meet "the good guys" and really care about what happens to them . Some scenes are left unexplained (like Derek's hallucinations), but you have the feeling that certain aspects were as if they were the foundation of a continuation. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this movie, this sequel will never happen. These few examples are forgivable, knowing that vampires could have been a continuum. <br /> <br /> Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? No. Is it a good way to spend about two hours entertained? Yes. It will not let the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and will not let the horror movie lover completely disappointed as well. If you are somewhere between the horror genre and the horror genre lover, this movie is for you. It reaches a happy medium with the effects and the story balancing itself. <br /> <br />
