This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and I only met it recently on DVD when my partner's grandson received it. He watched and was thrilled to know it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me. Luckily I borrowed it from him and watched on his own and cried for all of this. Not only did he capture the emotions, the class distinction, the difficulties and the heat of the human relations of those years (as well as the cruelties (spoken and unspoken), but it was accurate! I am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) in the right color (white) and all the impediments to the management of bombing sites and the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigades. I could not blame any of this from my memories, and the sandbags Anderson's shelter and the WVS canteens have brought it all back. The difference between the relatively untouched life in the village and war-torn London was also neatly presented, I relived 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London with this production! , of course, and no one would expect it more than this meticulous detail, but it went far beyond the precise representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only judgments of value In fact, one of the great high points of John Thaw's acting career and Gold's direction deserves to be better known. It is a magnificent film and I have already ordered some copies to send to friends.
