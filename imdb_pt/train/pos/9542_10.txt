Do not be fooled by the silly title folks, this is a sweet ride! A true successor to Tetsuo, the Iron Man, and Ichi the Assassin, this gem begins with a bang and puts the blood in the thick one until the credits roll. It seems that the aliens are taking people's bodies and modifying them in war machines, which are used to fight each other in a game distorted by the fun of their species. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. This is mainly for plot, but who cares when the blood is so good? I have no idea how many slime buckets were used, but it's disgusting to see. There is an interesting and effective use of stop-motion when acquisitions are in progress, and loving care is dispensed to all creature and makeup effects. The CGI is a bit limited, but this does not actually decrease the overall quality, at least for me. This was actually a fun and twisting movie that deserves a lot of praise, and really earned its place in the Cult Classics stack. Find and watch, you will not be disappointed!
