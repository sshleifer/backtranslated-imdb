Something about "Paulie" touched my heart as few movies do. It's a witty, funny, and emotional movie. I'm late in becoming a fan of this movie. I did not see "Paulie" until May of 2004 and since then I ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effects of Paulie's talking show are superb. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases. Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in the company of Gena Rowlands (Ivy), followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as the good-hearted human. You cheer for him throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong in renting or buying this movie !!
