Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at this stand-up comedy show on HBO. I love your impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden from "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson as well. The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also funny. I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair. I still find it very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh so much, he's one of the best people to come out of "Saturday Night Live." "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best stand up performance alongside "Raw Eddie Murphy". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.
