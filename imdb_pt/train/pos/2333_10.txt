I recently started watching this show, and I have to say that it really made me laugh. You have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people said that this show should have more realistic reactions from the dead, among other things. If you will accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that other completely crazy pieces of the show. I could not help but smile after every episode I watched. I really think it's great that there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch. I absolutely love the narration, I think adds a little more admiration to the whole show. You can not always compare old shows from a writer to the new ones, you have to take everything as an entity of your own. Definitely take a chance and enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
