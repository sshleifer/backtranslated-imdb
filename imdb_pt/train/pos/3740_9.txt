Although it was filmed on a Florida National Guard website, "Tigerland" reminded me totally of Fort Polk, LA, shots, maneuvering areas, waist-high water and everything. The film was quite authentic and the characters were similar to the same ones in my AIT in 1974. The difference between Tigerland year 1971 and 1974 is that all the sergeants and instructors knew they were not coming back to Vietnam, so the training was very relaxed - not a challenge. That was the forerunner of all our problems in the 1970s and 1980s, which I know I stayed through 2004. I never heard anyone mention "Tigerland", but the Army had realistic training villages in Vietnam at different bases in the USA. Vietnam Veterinarians tell me that until 1972 Basic & AIT could be quite rude and robust because the trainers were there and were forced to train Vietnam-bound men with these skills to do it, although this was not always the case. Both a sergeant in Polk and one of my veteran veterans from Vietnam, when we became instructors for a training brigade in Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get someone ready and people just had to find out and find out for themselves themselves. This movie is loud.
