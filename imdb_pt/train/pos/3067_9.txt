What a surprise to find in the afternoon of television. If I had read only a brief summary of the plot on a television list before watching the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie about a man who sees a psychiatrist - wanting to quit - and fall in love ... seems banal. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man carries a weight on his shoulders, before even saying a word. The appearance of the film is perfect. Dark, but not offensive. <br /> <br /> In addition to the familiar aspect of a man who gives a touch of surrealism, Macy's character faces his marriage and the control of his father. Macy shows a repressed sadness, and her bedtime conversations with her son are astounding. The young man shows acting skills well beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. , and I can not believe I came across it accidentally on late night television.
