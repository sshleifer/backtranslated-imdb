I remember this movie from when I was 12, it was amazing .. I remember the day not like most of the things I watched at the time, I even tried to buy it, but it's like the rocking horse sh * t! Anyway, the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real B movie with a low budget and event the fight scenes were awesome to watch, I must have watched about 20 times. It was a very well done film and I loved the idea of ​​fighting giant man-controlled robots, sorry that they had to spoil it by doing a spin off of "Crash and Burn", do not watch this movie by the way it is full pants! If you are a fan of science fiction movies, watch this, if it was re-done today, it would be a winner. I would really love to see a remake or even release the DVD of it.
