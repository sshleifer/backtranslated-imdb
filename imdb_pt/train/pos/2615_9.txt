While on a plane, flipping through the wide variety of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally. Oh boy! choice. <br /> <br /> I vaguely remembered seeing the trailer for more than a year and completely forgot that I expected no more than another nonsense movie about an idiot reality show. Now I can easily say that this was a hell of a ride. I do not remember the last time I was so excited, terrified. I'm not sure if it was at high altitude playing with my senses but the suspense gradually grows through the film until it reaches a climax where you can not move away from the screen literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails You will first pass by a personal moral assessment of where you stand on the fairness of the show. You will move away from the thought "how can the human being be so vicious" to "why not after all?". Ask yourself if you would do this. Then learn about the competitors, their motives and start guessing. You will then watch the contestant pulling the trigger one by one and getting excited even knowing that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good direction, with a movie experience reminiscent of those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still wishing more. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Some things I would have changed: The cast of the contestants. I really was moved by the farmer and we should have had a little more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it seemed like you did not care about some of the competition. While this may have been done on purpose, I think the public should have been able to associate with most competitors. - rules of the game, a big flaw: <br /> <br /> what happens if the fifth competitor does not die when he pulls the trigger. you seriously think that the last guy standing up will pull the trigger and run !!! they should have given a chance for all competitors to live, that is: if the 5th is also a blank, then no one dies. <br /> <br /> Curiously I have not bothered too much about these bad points because I really had a good time. I just wish I had some popcorn with me!
