Personally, this is one of my all time favorites! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own an old and original VHS of what I bought at a video store. I've watched it countless times. <br /> <br /> While it's a fun movie for kids, it's an intriguing movie for adults. Once I saw this movie while I was .. not sober. my eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I saw morale being strongly encouraged, both openly and somewhat subliminally ... I wish I could remember all the things I noticed in particular, but it's been a long time since then. Be sure, there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the film. if you have the chance to see it .. not sober .. do this, you will not be disappointed .. in fact you will probably feel quite happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Unique and Wonderful!
