Picture Bride has an excellent view of Hawaii's past and the people who lived there at the time. Time, money earned, and the hours these people put into their lives to survive and live have a brand new meaning for blood, sweat, and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of dating / marriage is something like what we do today similar via the net. That's just more in the mail. Snail very slow. <br /> <br /> The singing of the songs of the plantation of the workers reminds me of the songs of the workers of the plantations of the south of their death and future goals. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the hardships as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of rain and then tranquility.
