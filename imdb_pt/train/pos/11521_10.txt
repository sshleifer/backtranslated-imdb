Magicians is a wonderful walk from beginning to end, thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any really good movie, it's a journey where the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming. I can not believe this movie is so hard to find - I would buy it on DVD in a heartbeat, but have not yet found a way out.
