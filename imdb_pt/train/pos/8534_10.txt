Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia, a successful young novelist who ends up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the newly disabled after breaking his neck in a walking accident. As he learns to cope and adjust to the gravity of his new limited physical condition, Joel befriends the elegant womanizer Raymond (an incredible Wesley Snipes) and the rude, grouchy motorcycle rider Bloss (a great William Forsythe) who feels threatened. by the diverse multiethnic arrangement of patients with whom he is forced to share a room. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving girlfriend, but married Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt). But he must still accept being handicapped on his own. <br /> <br /> The remarkable triumph of this film is its stubborn refusal to sanitize or sentimentalize the gravity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the insightful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg report the story with good taste, insight and cordiality, addressing specifically disarmingly frankly and how the irrevocably altering their lifestyle, including and especially their sex life (this point is most powerfully done in a stunning sequence when Joel and Anna try and can not make love in a motel room). In addition to the expected pungency, the film still offers a surprising surplus of raw and earthy humor that is highlighted by the noisy sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nightly expedition to a strip club. Uniformly superb performance qualifies as yet another significant advantage: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are exceptional, highlighting Grace Zabriskie as Bloss's loving mother, Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospice nurses. Despite the somber affair, the film turns out to be a moving, positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the surprising strength and durability of the human spirit. A simply wonderful little gem of a drama.
