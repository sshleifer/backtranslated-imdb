Having grown tired of the rat race and tight New York City living conditions, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find the simple life. But building a house proves to be anything but simple. As headaches and beads begin to accumulate, so does laughter. Will Mr. Blanding have the house of your dreams? <br /> <br /> - What makes this movie so special are the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Any one of the three is able to make a movie on their own, so when you combine your talents, almost all the scenes are special. Grant was always one of my favorites on that kind of paper. He's so good at playing the husband. Loy is always a joy to watch. The Thin Man movies she made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become one of my favorites in the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely a product of its time. I keep imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bathroom home with a $ 15,000 income per year. Add in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a maid and this becomes almost fanciful. <br /> <br /> However, for those who bought or built a house, many of the situations and impasses in which the Blanding meet are easily related to the present day. And that's where comedy comes in. How many people did some of the stupid things that the couple does in that movie just to end up costing more money than expected? "The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the subplot of every" wife in love with a best friend. " It is not really necessary for the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented.
