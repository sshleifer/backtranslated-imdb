One of the few best movies of all time. The change from black and white to color to the sky and the Earth sequences was board excellence. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely clever, the complete film leaves you impressed with all human emotions and although a war film does not discriminate. I must have seen this movie more often than any other, and I never tire of it. It's a movie that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs about what happens after our death.
