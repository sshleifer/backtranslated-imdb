Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as a real-life Navy diver, Carl Brashear, who challenged a man's Navy to become the first African American Navy Diver. Sometimes at his side and sometimes his opponent was a man Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in many ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His portrait here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through each scene we can see your passion, motivation and stubbornness to reach your dream. We can see the fight inside him as he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and brought a lot of tension in some of the major dive scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine during a rescue mission is exciting and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I could see would have to stay in the supporting cast. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are very intricate and exciting to watch. Which makes you a bit sad when they have to hit heads with such two-dimensional support characters. The evil lieutenant commander. Hanks, Sunday's wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric colonel of the dive school (Hal Holbrook), and Cuba's love interest are the characters I met to not have much depth. What could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was that colonel always in his tower? How was the Sunday woman so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another curious question has to be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, if this movie is chronicling this man's life, would not your marriage be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor, however, is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit involves. This movie will inspire and make you feel for this man's fight. What I believe was the reason this powerful story was told. My hat goes to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
