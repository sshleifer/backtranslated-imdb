When "Girlfight" left, the reviews praised, but I did not get to see it. I finally saw when it was released on video, and I understood the brilliant reviews. <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We are quickly introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a grumpy expression on her face, and any idea about Diana we can derive from that expression will soon be confirmed when she gets into a fight. When Diana finds herself in trouble for this, we find her father, an aggressive type by itself; Of course we can not totally blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But the film really catches on, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this gloomy existence. His older brother has already entered boxing, but his father probably will not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. Only in the first few minutes alone did I identify that I was in a very non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly stated that. Even before you hit any boxing scene, you feel like you're being beaten in the face to see the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally get to the main storyline of the movie, there's no turning back. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I admit that using boxing as a means of showing someone trying to make something of themselves has been a kind of movie clich√© for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think they did a great job with this here. In fact, this may have taken the genre to the apex. Very good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez was lost in Hollywood movies after this one.
