Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas. I can not say much about this movie without revealing the story. I can tell that bit was how it looks like you're watching the photo. Everyone has their own agenda. Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by all.
