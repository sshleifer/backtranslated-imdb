I like Peter Sellers most of the time. I had never seen him portray a high-class British until this movie. He does it very well, although you see pieces of Inspector Clouseau in the mix. It's not interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected young Hawn to perform so solidly. His timing was great and his expressions were invaluable. The way she alternately shoots lascivious character con man and seduces him is lovely to behold. Verbal brawl as I rarely saw in a movie of that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie are spoken. Worth disappointing just to see the first sixties. Hawn is naked for a few glorious seconds at first. Enjoy...
