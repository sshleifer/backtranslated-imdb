When "Good Times" debuted in 1974, it was one of the first black family serials. He focused on the poor Evans family in Chicago and their struggles to survive. Most early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to support the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were wonderful actors and had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. was the adolescent son who pursued the skirt, but well-intentioned, that compensated his lack of subtlety with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive and brilliant girl who constantly exchanged insults with J.J. Michael was an almost prodigal child who was well educated in social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a big mistake by firing John Amos, literally killing his character. This really changed the focus, not the good I could add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior that angered black viewers as well as the star of the Esther Rolle series, which came out after next season. Instead of a program focused on the main African American issues that existed in the society at the time, spectators were given spectacles that were overloaded with chase after skits and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> As soon as Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although still watchable, it was no longer the groundbreaking show of yesteryear. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Rolle went back to the 1978 season, it became obvious that the show was on its last steps. . All loose ends were tied during that season and the show silently disappeared from the air. <br /> <br /> First three seasons: A. Last three seasons: C +.
