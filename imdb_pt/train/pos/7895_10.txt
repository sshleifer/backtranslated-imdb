In the opening scenes of this movie, a man shot arrows through his hotel room in another man's bathroom and turned off all the lights. That must have been pretty good for 1936, but how to get out and have nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not show up as much as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The August Whales," 87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy in her sweaters and the so-called swimsuit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase," 46. Daisey even proposed Johnny's wedding on a Ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one of them supposedly very rich and the other a very poor reporter. Off stage, Davis and Brent were having a real love affair, which is good because there were sparks when the two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
