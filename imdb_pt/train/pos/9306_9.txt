The world is a terrible place. But this movie is a scam and it's fun. And if you do not like it ... you do not understand ... and if you can not ... it does not matter. It's up to you if you want to play together. Every actor in this movie had fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is invaluable. Byrne and Paul Anka making my way is as "Vic" puts it, "... the best ever version". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned against seeing him, but I'm sure I was happy ...
