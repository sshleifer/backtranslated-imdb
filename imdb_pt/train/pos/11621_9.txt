I was bored one night and the Red Eye was on and I thought why not. <br /> <br /> The Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just got in the movie made it just so brilliant. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two major tracks in the film with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian. Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The acting is simply brilliant and you feel the feeling of the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is simply excellent, it gives shivers and it can also make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I just love how the movie was so well done and never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like Red Eye so much that I can watch it several times. <br /> <If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
