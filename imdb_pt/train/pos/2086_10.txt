Faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years have passed in China as children of missionary parents who have given her insights into Chinese culture and philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly accomplished in both art and art. Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the essentials of life: to survive from his land and to be newly married to Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family in the village area. Despite Wang Lung and Olan's best efforts to cultivate the land, raise children, and build economy and wealth, hunger threatens to do away with everything they worked for. Choosing not to sell their land, a traditional Asian belief, they travel to a large city to expect hunger. While in town, they are reduced to begging and are just one of hundreds of other unfortunate families. Although not a spoiler, Olan is caught in a loot at a rich man's house. She is summarily snatched for execution by the army, but is saved at the last minute. Her good fortune, however, is that she found valuable jewelry at the service site that allows her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over. The newly discovered wealth transforms Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, egocentric and takes credit for the find. He becomes a very wealthy farmer, but this only makes things worse as he becomes increasingly indifferent, arrogant and difficult to reason. He loses contact with the basic things in life that money can not buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, justice, and honesty. As punishment, nature once again turns the table to Wang Lung, sending a plague of locusts to destroy everything he has. On his knees, Wang Lung enlists the help of all his friends, ex-friends, workers, and family. With all this help, he manages to save the farm. From this experience, he once again returns to humility and appreciation for the basics of life.
