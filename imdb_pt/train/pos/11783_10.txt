Rock Star: INXS was the best TV music series I've ever watched! He had some of the greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written, performed by 15 very talented singers / performers. He also had (in my opinion) the most amazing finals on all reality shows. In fact, it made me shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! During the 13 weeks of this televised competition, the audience heard and became familiar with all competitors. After 30 episodes, the remaining competitors seemed more like friends than just a few strangers competing against each other on a reality show. And the fact that INXS was, and still is, one of the biggest rock n 'roll bands, only added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality show. If you do not have the series recorded, the DVD is a great alternative.
