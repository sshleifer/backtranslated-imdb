This Oliver production is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly brilliant Invisible Character who crosses this darkness by leading an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative. Yes, though Oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he does not fear evil. A stick and a team are there to comfort you. In the end, it is saved from the waste of mankind. In the background is Fagin, the most perverse of the lot. Fagin contemplates the repentance of his ways not once but twice but diminishes because he is not willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes because he creates small pickpockets that become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. Her innocence is immaculate, but not tested, either. The best is Nancy. Lack of judgment, she ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikes's deep need for love. However, unlike Fagin, at the probable cost of her own life, she repents of her sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability. I would give this movie a "10", but the soundtrack and ambience of the 70s made for its own TV distracted it. Overall, a good parable and a story completely appropriate for all audiences.
