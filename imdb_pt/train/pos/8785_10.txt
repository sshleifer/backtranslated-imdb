Some say "The play is the most important thing," or something, is attributed to that old bard of Avon, William Shakewspeare. if it was not for old Will, it may well have been our own super-veteran film director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. None is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). The film also brings another award, being chosen as Errol Flynn's favorite of his own star-studded cars. He clearly gives on-screen evidence that would easily take viewers sitting in the dark theater, or watching them on their TV or DVD, to complete the same. <br /> <br /> To be sure, the story is a serious semid movie. Biopic, which takes a lot of factual material and mixes it with a liberal dose of the old imaginary to bring us a very satisfying, if somewhat fictional, occurrence (what Biopic is not?). is excellent as it makes good use of the natural athletic ability of our leader, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although not a Swashbuckler, a western or war movie, this GENTLEMAN JIM is perhaps the protagonist who was the best fit for the robust Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic boxing team in 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in "sweet science" are clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the "Great Fight" for the Championship World Heavyweight Boxing with the great John L. Sullivan, Himself. by Ward Bond) The cast looks like a roster of Warner Brothers resident support players. He has Alan Hale as the father of Jim Corbet, a Livery Wagon * operator. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two "blue-collar" men of the family, with their occupations being declared "Longshormen." <br /> <br /> The great Jack Carson does his usual masterful serious-comic performance in support as a friend of Jim Corbett's and colleague's bank teller. The others we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn, to name but a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh also used a number of Pro Wrestlers in roles of various Boxers. Hence we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and an unknown Grappler * are presented as the 2 seaside pugs in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (have you heard of him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful yet unpolished look on them that the old fighters of Pier 9 would have owned. <br /> <br /> We do not forget the Lady Leader, Alexis Smith. She is powerful in her characterization of an "independent" woman, but maintains quite a true ability as a comic in many of the scenes. She shows a good fan on her part as a poor and rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all of these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to blend the elements into appropriate proportions to give the "right". 'mixture. Well, director Walsh does this with a reckless abandon. Because he's looking for, above all, a great movie. His treatment shows all the skills he had perfected for a fine-tuning beginning with his days as a player with DW Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period, the 1890s. *** The direction of Mr. Walsh passes the script at a relatively fast pace, breaking the exposure scenes with a humorous joke, "the Corbetts are into it again!" So he is able to keep a light touch, even humorous, on a story that can become very monotonous and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh gives us an authentic look of a Francis of the 1890s. And as another example of his liking for this period, he creates ample, dynamics of the historic Prize Fights. There is a vibrant and cheerful atmosphere conveyed in these boxing scenes. As a crowning glory for this great film, perhaps underestimated, director Walsh took a look at the image as if it were an illustration of The Police Gazette, which covered such events in those "Old Days." <br /> <br /> But there's only one thing to remember before you see. If it is for the first time, or if you are seeing it again: "THE CORBETES ARE IN THE NEW" <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion as a historian of both Cinema and Pro Wrestling, it seems that Tor Johnson, who years later was the favorite of director Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> ** Livery is a rather archaic term for a rental car for local rentals. transportation of the city. <br /> <br /> It's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a veteran Griffith player. He was the actor to play John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915). Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and the Sullivan-Corbett Championship Bout and what it meant for Sporting Life in America those days.
