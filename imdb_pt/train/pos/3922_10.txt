Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say which is the best performance: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are excellent. They dance their souls. It is a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth; myth pervades everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people, at the same time, live their own lives and become another person, represent the parts of lovers of antiquity. The magic continues.
