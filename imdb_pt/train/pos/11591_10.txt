I've also been looking for this movie for some time, and how great it would be to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was about 6 in Holland. And I was very impressed by that. It was shown before the JUNGLE BOOK of Walt Disney! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was an eagle's friend. That impressed me a lot. For some reason he was expelled from his village (he did not understand why). When other boys threw rocks at him, he climbed a rock and jumped out. At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. Like an eagle, he was still wearing his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
