One of the great science fiction works of all time, as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but he is overcome by Pitt's incredibly frenetic turn, which is unlike anything he has done before or since. Even Stowe is not out of his league here, though. The story is very layered and offers a lot to think about. The weather scene is magnificently beautiful and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes at the psychiatric hospital are scary and yet funny in their own way. Very black humor on display here. Fantastic production design and cinematography suitably bizarre. In my top ten.
