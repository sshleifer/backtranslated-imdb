I actually did not start to watch the show until it came on FX. I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the reruns of the show were debuting so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it first aired on t.v. I loved the show a lot! Finally a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step, and they were good shows, but they were not funny enough. They'd make stupid jokes and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not that 70's show. That 70's show was hilarious, clever and so real. I think it was the best show of all time and I'm sorry it was over. Although I love this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season, when Eric and Kelso left. Last season was not right, Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character left. I still love this show and I hope the TV starts to do more shows like this.
