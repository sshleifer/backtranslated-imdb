OK, here's my personal list of the top Nicktoons shows like today: 1. All grown up / SpongeBob Square Pants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenage robot /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Notice a word only with capital letters? That means this is Nick's program that I'm going to talk about. "Catscratch" is basically a simple but great animation comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who get in strange and REALLY surreal situations, from the attempt to join to the Kimberely Pajama Party Human for root beer to save a planet from the evil ship's slugs. This is a Nick show you'll simply have your funny bone tickling sooner or later! The theme song is captivating and memorable. Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the "Seinfield" franchise - bring the characters to a new life with very peculiar personalities. The stories are pleasant (the episodes of the fans would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And the humor is all done in some Jim Earthworm style. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which becomes very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less .
