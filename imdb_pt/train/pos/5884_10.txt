Really enjoyed it. The premise was good, the story fit where both series stopped, and here's my favorite part. Maria and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or make possible meetings (A good example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie was saying she'd be happy to make another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I'd be looking for another one ... but if that does not work, then they can re-run this.
