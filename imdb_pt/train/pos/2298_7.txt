I love occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, who made one of his greatest films with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), proved to be more than capable in this field of Horror. This tenth occultist episode of Hammer's short TV series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss", is indeed a frightening entry into the series. Director Don Sharp, who had already enriched Hammer's work with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and also directed two "Fu Machu" films starring Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the best-known names among HHH's directors, and he also delivers here. Antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles on a mysterious old glass. The seer glass is the object of the desire for a devil-worshiping cult who wants to use it for his satanic rituals. When he hosts a beautiful girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who is to be sacrificed for worship, Michael gets into deeper issues with the cult and its sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not one of my absolute episodes favorite of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best is clearly the brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), is very creepy and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists and remains full of suspense and supernatural throughout the film. Ray Lonnen makes a good lead, young Rosalyin Landor is compelling as innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly scary as the leader of the Satanists. Overall, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and scary HHH tale, and my fellow Hammer fans should not miss it.
