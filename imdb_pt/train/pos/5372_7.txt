Of the first five episodes of Hammer's short series "Hammer House of Horror", this fifth episode, with the wonderful title "The House that bled to death," is possibly the most chilling. As a big fan of the Gothic Horror movies of Hammer Studios for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series recently. So far, I've only seen the first five episodes, and I have the strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series continues as fun as the first five episodes, I'll be satisfied. Considering that the second and third episodes were great for watching your morbidly and ingeniously dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely the only one of the top five that offers the most genuine Horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move home with their daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Soon after the move, however, the family has to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which is seemingly haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his previous mediocre entry, "Growing Pains "(Episode 4), and the very unknown actors perform well. The film is also well done in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "The House That Bleed to Death" is a solid episode that features the elements that my fellow Hammer fans would love to see in a Short Terror tale. The film offers a scary atmosphere, genuine scary moments and clever twists, and is full of suspense and lots of fun from the beginning to the end. Overall, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
