Back in '74, Eric Monte made the classic TV series Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching the Reruns in T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous of the popularity of Jimmie Walker, earning millions of fans to sit and watch Good Times. The show would be dead if JJ was not there to save him with his attitude always Kool Aid. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when he left and 8 when it was over. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have been longer than in the 1980s, when I was just growing up.
