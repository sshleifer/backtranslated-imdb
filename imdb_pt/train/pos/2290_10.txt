While Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" enters theaters with little fanfare and a lot of mockery, it makes me think of 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" came out. Now, while all of Kurt Vonnegut's talk is "non-flammable", it is surprising that he has achieved two excellent cinematic treatments (the other is "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is certainly one of the most underrated films of the decade and I can not understand why. It's brilliant! It remains almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being blistered or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. How many cinematic adaptations of any author's work can claim this? Vonnegut even makes an appearance at the end of the movie, and you can ask for a better endorsement than that? It's not just a beautiful movie, it's a beautifully rendered, written and directed film and it's among my choices for the five American films of the 1990s. It's a sad, inspired and surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I sincerely encourage anyone to see "Mother's Night" - you do not even have to be familiar with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as sometimes happens with "Slaughter-house Five"). It's a powerful and moving piece of cinema.
