10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British doctor from India, currently in India. the word that Beckham put me off because I'm a fan of Liverpool, and personally I think Owen is pretty cool. As Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was sure I would not see the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought, "what the hell, let's wait the time watching this movie" because it was a show late at night. <br /> <br /> What an idiot I was. I should have seen this movie the day it was released. I think using Beckham's name was to attract the audience's appeal (which was dismissed in my case !!!), but I really can not think of a better title for the film. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, do not like Manchester United (or England), then this is DEFINATELY the movie for you. In fact, I'm only 29 years old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a child at heart. This movie toppled "Star Wars" from my # 1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not many comments about this movie by Indians like me. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
