Great fun. I've been with 8 friends for a preview of this movie. We came to see a different one, but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got in this time the jokes became funny and were funny all through the movie. In the first part, you just wonder about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' (there are many other examples of this language) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. In search of this malinski, all the main characters are introduced, the first one even more crazy than the other. Until halfway through the movie, we did not even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to that view, but we sure had a lot of fun. The house was crowded (about 250 people) and I think half of them did not like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange comedy movies with great dialogue, you'll love it. Beyond Clooney This movie deserves far better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more people have seen it, I'm sure it will rise. 7.0 is reasonable I think, I'd give it 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
