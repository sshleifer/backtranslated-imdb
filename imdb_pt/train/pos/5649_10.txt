I'm watching the series again now that it's on DVD (yay!) It's calling me again, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired. <br /> <br /> The central performances are exciting, the scripts I'm steeped. <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my neck out and put it up there with The Prisoner as a show that will be gaining new fans and will still be watched in 2035. <br /> <br /> I went invited to write a few more lines (it seems that the IMDb is as hostile to the user and anally retained as ever!) Pithy and to the point is not clearly the path of the IMDb.) <br /> <br /> Well, unlike editors of submissions from IMDb, American Gothic, understand that simplicity is everything. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. In addition, it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way that challenges the viewer to wonder about what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the first program in the air, I was still suffering for Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap cheap. Personally, I'm starting to evaluate it better and I suspect it will stand up better over the years. I do not think it's more controversial than that!
