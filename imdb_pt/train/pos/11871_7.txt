Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, the SCARFACE paints an image that is not easily forgotten. Al Pacino has an impressive performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, who becomes a powerful player in the world of drugs while ruthlessly directing his crime kingdom in Florida. This gangster movie is tough, violent, loud, coarse, unpleasant and should contain the record of uttering the word "f - k" the most times. Almost three hours in length and yes it can be repulsive. A sturdy constitution keeps you in place by cheering for the disappearance of a cruel lord of crime. <br /> <br /> They are also playing interesting characters: Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He can bring reality to your character that leaves a strong impression. This is not going to be a movie for everyone, because you leave thinking you're away from a disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!
