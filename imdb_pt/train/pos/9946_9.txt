Dream Quest was an amazingly good movie. There have been some noticeable errors, but this can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. I did not feel like moving forward during the movie and found it a lot of fun. It's kind of silly sometimes, but overall I recommend it. They probably used all the brightness in the nearby shops, and some of the costumes were very good.
