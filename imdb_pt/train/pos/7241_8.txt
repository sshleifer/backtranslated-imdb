Paul Lukas portrayed a Russian intellectual earning his living as a waiter in "Grand Slam," directed by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satire of the emergence of celebrity. The waiter and girl in the Russian restaurant hat, played by Loretta Young, become US boyfriends as bridge partners who do not fight. With the help of publicity and ghostwriter 'Speed' McCann (the wonderfully blank Frank McHugh), they become itinerant advertisements for the 'Stanislavsky system', a 'system' of bidding on anything that feel <br /> <br /> (since the bids are not rational, there is no basis for recriminations about your stupidity). <br /> <br /> A duel with the displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (looks close to Goren, does not it? and I suspect that the choice of the character's name "Stanislavsky" was also a hit on another type of system) , an inflated charlatan played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations across America as a prize-winning fight by Roscoe Karns (Another Great Comedian Comedian Actor of the 1930s). <br /> <br /> Bridge players are even in an isolated square, although the audience is above them, unlike them. In boxing "rings". The wide variety of American types prefigures the comedies of Preston Sturges, although for the manufacture of celebrities, "Grand Slam" most draws attention to two best films of the same time (pre-Code), with Lee Tracy doing quick publicity: "The Half-Naked Truth" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has its moments <br /> <br /> especially for anyone who has ever played bridge with serious points <br /> <br /> counters. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clothes horse. (For me, her face seems a little long <br /> <br /> And horsey, too. <br /> <br /> Another notion of beauty era, I guess ...) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, except drops Glenda Farrell, who plays McHugh's forgotten girlfriend <br /> <br />
