The film is very thorough in what it is, keeping continually interested in the flashbacks of childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the serial murder tails, one just can not go wrong. The very plot itself, the very story and essence of the film, is fun. It's the kind of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much, and in this case, he really did a lot of it. From beginning to end you keep waiting more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film were exquisitely done from beginning to end, and one of those rare gemstones that seemed to be without any tedious lull - the action flowing clear, fast and steadily from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> Demonstrate how far people can go: to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such evil deeds, in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned, as in this case. He is also sometimes interesting in his twists and turns and assumes the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the type of film that is easily ignored, but I recommend that you do not do the same. and to check out this movie - it's worth it.
