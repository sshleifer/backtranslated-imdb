This movie was absolutely wonderful. The time and culture of the pre-partition were beautifully recreated. Urmila gave another brilliant performance. What I really admire about this movie is that it does not resort to the attack on Pakistan that is running loose on films like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a backdrop, the film does not deviate to political issues or focuses on violence or what is right or wrong. The film always revolves around the tragic story of Urmila's life. His fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai was described in an excellent way. The film really shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film.
