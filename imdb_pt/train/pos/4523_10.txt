When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was on the air in this movie, my expectations of watching the whole movie were low. The only reasons that gave me a chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be a kind of farce "Mrs. Doubtfire" turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy. Pasdar is totally credible and empathetic as the ambitious businessman who needs to liberate the feminine part of his being while dressing on a few occasions. It conveys these needs to the public in a completely believable way. Julie Walters is magnificent, it is as her habit, as the owner who teaches her unconditional love.
