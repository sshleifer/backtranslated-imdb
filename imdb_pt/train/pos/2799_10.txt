As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this movie, though secretly I hoped it was East is East II. The trailers looked fun, so I thought I'd give it a try. It took about ten minutes, but after that I was glued to the canvas, and that had nothing to do with the cramp around my neck. caused by sitting too close to the front due to a crowded auditorium. The acting was new and vibrant, the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny. The whole auditorium was laughing loudly every minute. Football fan or non-football fan, the sport has become irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, dare I say this ... better than the East is the East. <br /> <br /> This movie trots very well at a lovely pace, never lingering on anything more than necessary, leaving nothing unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally involved. Although not a characteristically torturous film, there are some nice surprises along the way and things do not always happen as you would expect. <br /> <br /> Saying this, there were elements of predictability, but these were satiricly exploited more than used as script filler. I suppose depending on your particular tendency towards happy endings, you might be delighted / disappointed with the ending. Personally, if there were any other result, I would have written a letter with strong words to the writers. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) did the best. . I never knew that people like this existed, but she, her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts, convinced me that they possibly do! The prize for the most unconvincing (of the main characters) unfortunately goes to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, until she offered a great performance, it's just that someone has to be the last of the best and sorry Kiera , this time you are it. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not quit before the credits. As soon as the lights came back on, I realized, to my horror, that maybe I should not have watched this movie after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted in a sugary blue juice. Oh, what I'm saying, it was absolutely wonderful and I can not recommend it highly enough. I'll definitely buy it when I leave and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I just speck if it's really worth it.
