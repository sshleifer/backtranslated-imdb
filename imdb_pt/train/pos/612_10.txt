This remarkable film can be summarized very easily. First, while comparisons with the "Promised Princess" are inevitable, it is almost pointless to do so. While both films combine wit and humor with a fairy tale scenario, "Stardust" is very different from any other fantasy / science fiction movie I've ever seen. It is a hybrid of these genres, but its plot and script are so unique that - along with performances, special effects, cinematography and score - the finished product simply is not so comparable to anything that has ever appeared. silver screen. Second, the score is very effective in pulling us simultaneously into the story and the fantasy world in which it occurs and propel the story, creating the right amount of reverence and excitement necessary to make magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film even remotely difficult to keep up or confused in any way. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main subframes actually made it even more interesting to watch. Wonderfully conjured and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with elements of science fiction) was the best I've seen since "The Return of the King" (not that I'm comparing the two). OK, so it's not that easy to summarize, but do not let any crude and / or heartless, cynical reviews or the pathetic RP of the movie keep you from participating in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!
