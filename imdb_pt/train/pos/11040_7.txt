I watched this French horror movie last night and I really enjoyed it. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a diary handwritten on a wall of a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. As they examine the diary, they discover that it plunges into the black arts and commands that may be outside the cell and freedom. What they discover is something completely different and horrifying to say the least. I like low-budget horror movies, which deliver the goods in a reasonably good way, and tell a good story. This movie does just that, although it takes a while to continue. The result and the horror they unleash are very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the ride. Not much gore, but that would not fit the story, although the blood it has is very good.
