Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in the somber tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent working on propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions want to unearth his past. As with much of Vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident as the youngest Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
