In response to the person who commented on how the movie trails and who believed there was no purpose for the role of Jess's brother here is my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in history. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have foreseen the problems associated with living life to the fullest, seeing how Jess's brother appeared. There are several cases where Brad Pitt and their lives run in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and later finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there, so the character of Craig Sheffer would have a greater emotional turmoil in the death of his brothers, knowing that he could have done more to avoid this and subsequently create a more attractive mood in the film.
