I do not usually like reality shows, particularly those who are profiting from the success of "American Idol." But the one with whom I can live. <br /> <br /> Comedians from all over the world perform a brief routine for celebrity hunters, and if they like them, these guys will be sent to perform a routine for a real audience. . Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live together in a house and participate in "Survivor" style competitions using comedic tactics. Then one will be determined as "Last Comic Standing". I like stand up comedy, so this is the only reality show that should interest my interests. Usually there are some quite funny comics selected. He began the career of talents such as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that many of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality. show drama. At first, they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they've done with it, thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of comedians that I felt, they were chosen not because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc. when other comics clearly should have beaten them. But overall, it's a reality show well done, which are two terms so far that I thought were an oxymoron.
