This is one of the funniest and best movies ever made! Although I have only seen forty minutes and I must say that this is a good movie. The plot is funny and because there is sex around practically every corner of this movie. It's very funny and I do not see how anyone could not like this movie. I really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has a slightly sick scene (trust me, it's not very nice), but other than that, it's a great movie. I rate this 7/8 movie for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. Please, if you are a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there is practically all the sex in it, buy this movie. He will please you. <br /> <br /> 10/10
