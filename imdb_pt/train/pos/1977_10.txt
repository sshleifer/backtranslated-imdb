I really love this movie. I remember once when I was in second grade, my teacher showed us on a roll of 16mm film. This film, however, can be a bit scary for sophomores such as the scene in which Bill assassins Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives is tired of watching this movie because she studied it in music class. If I were a teacher and could graduate the people who produced this wonderful film, I would give them an A +.
