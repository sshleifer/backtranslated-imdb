Most people know Paul Verhoeven as director of many good (and bad) science fiction films in Hollywood. But long before that he was producing generic films in his homeland. History is a basic premise of the femme fatale, nothing new or catchy. Verhoeven thinks he can improve by adding a series of dream sequences, which, instead of defining our main character and his situation, are used only as a way to boost the predictable plot. The script was solid, the dialogue helping to fill the effects of the bland story. What really made the movie at least good was a great performance. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the "tortured artist", and the supporters were also very good. In addition, Jan De Bont's cinematography adds at least a bit of life to the film, helping to make Verhoeven seem less capable as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
