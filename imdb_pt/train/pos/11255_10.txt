This is undoubtedly my favorite novel by Le Carre and is transformed into the silver screen with all the love and affection one could wish for. I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters disgusting, but I believe that misses the point. All the stories of Le Carre are essentially love stories and this is no exception. It is a precise reflection of the period in which it is defined. Betrayal is everyone's key for the good of no one. Pym's creation is so close to mine that I see her watching. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late Ray McAnally is unbelievably good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are on track. This cast is the dream of a theater entrepreneur. History should not be spoiled by an ill-informed description, but suffice it to say that it is a slow and inexorable destruction of the young man, and descendant in espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies are with Magnus Pym and his only (non-sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - as wonderful as ever, his only real friendship, but also by definition, another in the long line of betrayals. love.
