everything is very simple. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with the cheaters and the masters of chess. they pity their history of loss and failure, and misery in which he lives because of his belief in his mastery of little tricks and control of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom of their innermost fears, of what he believes to be himself. for this, they take him on a journey where he has to let go of all fear, all pride, all hope - reborn as true master of his will. <br /> <br /> It's a clever movie about the journey of enlightenment, about the endless gambling and games that we make with and within ourselves. 10/10, without a doubt.
