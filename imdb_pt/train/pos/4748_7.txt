The story would never win awards, but that's not what it's all about ... the script was just fun and full of suspense enough to make way for incredibly choreographed fighting scenes. Who needs a story to fight like that? It really is worth watching for just that reason. If you can handle the blood, of which there is much ... none of this done realistically enough to be difficult to look at. I gave a 7.
