I have to admit, this movie moved me to the point where I started to cry. However, I always think about things twice, and instead of writing a compliment that defines the film as flawless and flawless, I'd rather take the risk of a closer look. <br /> <br /> First what is first: the film has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it begins and continues as a slow-paced movie that does not try to surprise you with the actual scenes of September 11 . Thumbs up for this stroke of genius because, unlike Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER, this film fortunately does not focus on the attack itself, but on the precipitation that, similar to the consequences of a nuclear explosion, is hardly visible but dangerous and devastating. The psychological impact, the devastation that 9/11 has caused, and the destruction it has inflicted on the American people is almost palpable in this film. I think Binder got an astute observation of post-9/11 society, and Sandler, in my opinion, jumped from a regular comedy actor to a real-life talent that does an Oscar-winning performance. In the movie BLOOD DIAMOND, the character Di Caprio says and I quote: "Ah, these Americans, they always want to have their feelings." Now, I do not want to belittle your sufferings, but I'm sure you'd like to make a comparison. Since September 11, the whole world has been confronted with memories, memorials, and commemorations of September 11. The Hollywood industry and writers like Safran Foer more than alluded to 9/11 in their works. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with September 11, turns the death of 3,000 people into the greatest tragedy of this young century. The number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and I say this with all due respect, explode the importance of this outrageous crime to a certain extent disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Fact is: People die every day because of unfair actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people. We have a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma, and many other countries. Every day we forget the poverty that Africans suffer from and tend to empathize with them to a lesser extent than with the American victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives do not have much in common with our western lives. Africa has neither the money nor the potential to celebrate its national tragedies in a way the United States can. So what I am saying is this: The reason we feel more for the 3,000 victims of September 11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a movie or a book discussing 9-11. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I made up my mind about Charlie Fineman, but I was not sure I had the right to feel for him more than for a Hutu who lost his whole family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> Did you take my frugality?
