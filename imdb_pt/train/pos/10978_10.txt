Several years ago, when I first watched "Gray Gardens", I remember laughing and finding a hilarious camp. Years later, I still laugh aloud as I watch her, but after many exhibitions, I see the beauty of the strange and distorted relationship between the inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. Mother and daughter living together in their decadent East Hampton mansion with 28 rooms add new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic." With countless cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates, this aunt and niece of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles to enter their mansion to film them living their lives day by day. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and the rule of anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. And their lives an example of determination, determination and free will. This movie has more to recommend than I can put into words. It is a rare experience that you should see for yourself. <br /> <br />
