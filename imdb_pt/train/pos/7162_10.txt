This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and enjoyed it, but this movie expands everything the book has made famous. The acting is fantastic, especially Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This movie has a certain way of telling stories that keeps you stuck throughout the process until the end where everything is brought together for a great ending. I also love the way it is directed, blinking back and forth between the modern day and the histories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for the movies, and Andrew Davis does a great job of directing it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes good movies.
