My favorite movie of all time! I've seen a lot of movies, but this one beats them all! Excellent acting, wonderful story. You will, as a "normal" person, begin to love George. Although he is an actor, he is himself and a very kind person. And maby most important thing: you will learn to respect and look different for people with Down Syndrome.
