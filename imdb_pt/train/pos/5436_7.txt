For years, I found this service comedy to be a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the leaders. It certainly has the same crude humor that Ford uses in his movies. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I discovered that it was George Stevens who actually directed it. I still refuse to believe that this film was not offered to John Ford, but he was probably in Monument Valley doing Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen, along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., play three. sergeants in the Indian Army who have a good comrade / comrade comradeship going. But the old gang is breaking up because Fairbanks is engaged to Joan Fontaine. Not if your two friends can help you, aided and encouraged by the monster of Gunga Din regiment, played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem was the inspiration for this RKO movie about the life in barracks in the British Raj. . The comic play of the protagonists is so good that it overshadows the film's incredibly racist message. Not that the manufacturers were racist, but that was the British assumption back then, including our leadership, and Gunga Din shows it more effectively. The English took India in increments, making deals here and there with the local rulers under a weak Mongol emperor who was disposed of in the mid-nineteenth century. They ruled very little of India, that would be impossible. Your government depended on the native troops you see here. Note that soldiers can not rise above cable level and Gunga Din is considerably lower in status than that. <br /> <br /> Note here that the rebels are in fact Hindus, not Muslims. There are as many strains of this religion as there are Christian sects, and this strangulating cult was quite real. Of course for those who are being strangled they may not have the same view of them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the Congress Party emerged, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> But as you cut it off, strangling people is not a good thing to do. and the British also had their argument here. When I watch Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason the first guideline came out. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant had to play his real cockney self here instead of the urban Cary we're used to seeing. . Fairbanks and McLaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities. <br /> <br /> The role of best actor in the film, however, is Eduard Ciannelli as the guru, the head of the strangler cult. Watch the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone off the screen when he's on the scene. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli exhorting his troops in his temple on the mountain. Notice how Stevens progressively darkens the background around Ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a macabre Halloween mask. Haunting, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was shortly after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the British public began to question the underlying assumptions that justify the Raj. But this is the subject of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great movie, fun and entertaining. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can trace how the Indian independence movement evolved.
