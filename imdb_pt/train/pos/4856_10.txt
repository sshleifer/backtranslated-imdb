I saw this movie for the first time years ago and I have continued to see it several times a year when I get a chance. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. If someone tells you it's silly or outdated, ignore it ... this movie is for anyone who likes to laugh and listen to music. Dance is not as important in this film as in other Astaire films, so comedy and acting shine. Watch this movie if you can, it may be light but it is still completely entertaining. So I know a lot of people hate black and white movies, they think old movies can not be really funny, that movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without even being slightly amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without dancing. He may be a great performer and a capable singer, but it is not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy gets a bit clich√©d at times, but the performances of G Burns and G Allen are perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone who is looking for a few easy laughs. Give this movie a chance, even if you do not like old movies, this movie may appeal to ridicule on anyone.
