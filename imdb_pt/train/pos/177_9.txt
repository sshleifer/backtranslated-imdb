This is a feel-good movie and nothing more. And for that, it's a lot of fun to watch. Of course these are political issues. But so what? I'm sure she was not trying to make "good night and good luck" here. We will not try to do anything else, but what is ... light fare. <br /> <br /> And very nice at it! <br /> <br /> Remember how it was 1984? We have become very sophisticated according to the media as far as we are concerned or not. I tend to differ at this point. Goldie knew this was fun and she moved on and did. <br /> <br /> Just like your lighter fare: Protocol, To the Sea, Houses, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Looks Like Old Times, Gross Game, Death Becomes Your First Wives Club and the Out- of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she's doing ... she plays all the roles for the camp you can get! Goldie knows herself very well and knows what she can do very well. <br /> <br /> She always made me laugh joyfully and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and in all the things she's been to. She never tried to be anything other than who she is ... and this is that bubbly and laughing girl who is very beautiful and has a smile and a laugh that will always please me and remind me that life is very short and that you alone you need to cheer yourself up because before you realize ... you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable evils. If it's that late. <br /> <br /> I thank Goldie for what she is: a lovely comedic actress.
