I really did not know what to expect when I went out to watch the movie, in addition to the slightly surreal basic storyline that a lone man commands to a Russian bride over the internet. That and Nicole Kidman had it. I really loved the movie, and left thinking 'wow'. <br /> <br /> Refreshing to the earth, the film moves very well, with some surprises in every corner. The relationships in the film are believable, with Nicole and Chaplin working beautifully against each other. The humor is subtle, with some great 'office' scenes on the bench, and the thriller element adds tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is about real people in an unusual situation. It's less about heroism and more about delicate relationships. Brit-film at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
