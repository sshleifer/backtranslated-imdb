... than that ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together on a movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil ... when, at one point, the story moves directly into the twilight zone ... bringing nothing new, but nothing at all ... and nothing is much fun! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie gets really fun ... bouncy heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise of FantasyFilmFest this year ... <br /> <br /> Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this a minimalist design, strange but very special, which makes it difficult to locate the location of the story or its time ... somehow ...
