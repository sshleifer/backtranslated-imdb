The first von Trier movie I've ever seen was breaking the waves. Of course a good movie, but definitely stands in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany soon after World War II. He accepts a job that his uncle arranged for him as a steward on a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels through a Germany almost completely destroyed, is faced with the murder of traitors and searches for former members of the Nazi party. Society is suffering from corruption. His uncle tightened his conscience, focusing on the work he also has as a steward on the train. Coincidentally, the protagonist was involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called "werewolves", who pressured him to put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is taken from the scene by a man trying to put the viewer under hypnosis and then telling him to wake him up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen too much !!!!!!! Europe!!
