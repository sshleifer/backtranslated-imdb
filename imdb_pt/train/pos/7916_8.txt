Well, well .... Roeg got a little nerve there, did not he? He was a genius while cataloging the offspring of his various characters in psychosis for a few decades, but so he had the bad taste of suggesting that redemption (or even some good advice) could be found in the old, bad Catholic church. , the multitude of more funky alternative films becomes more cruel. Worse yet, the character of Theresa Russell - confronted with experiences that nothing in his overtly rationalist outlook has an explanation for, is unwillingly forced to deal with these experiences on another level - the spiritual. You know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, the kind of thing that movie buffs in art should be. Oh, the horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it can be an exclusively important commitment - asserted by what seems uncomfortably similar to divine intervention. People who find this offensive idea prima facie may wonder why they instinctively jump into attack mode by being challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably will not. Of course, this movie has some problems, notably Talia Shire's delirious work as the exhausted nun, the 1950s style outfit and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in his last scene is direct from the Glib School of Interpretations (although Hitchcock's film escaped similar charges because of the wisdom source having long-standing credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have suffered so much criticism for even asking the question as to the possible answers that this film presents.
