It's about an embezzlement, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, passing himself off as a computer expert and security expert. He secretly learns to hack into the computer, as he gathers the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of office rival Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> The details of the deal were a bit obscure for those non-business eyes, but they are quite convincing and I have the general idea. Ustinov, the sinner Peter, establishes fake business in Paris, Rome, and Stuttgart, and uses the Texa-Conn computer to send all kinds of money to these counterfeit establishments. Foreign companies, of course, consist of nothing more than himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are an abandoned artist's loft in Paris, a barber shop in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he has sent. <br /> <br /> I did not think I'd like the first few minutes because it seemed a bit slow. I was expecting something with a faster pace and more outrage, along the lines of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang". But this film insinuates itself in its good graces by appreciating the underestimated humor in the plot, the characterizations and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to give a lot of relatively subtle jokes, but here are some examples of the most noticeable. <br /> <br /> Ustinov to Secretary Smith: "Let me have the assets of these companies." Smith: "Assets? What are they?" Ustinov: "little female donkeys". Now, nothing is made of this little exchange. There is a quick cut and no delay for any laughter, which is appropriate because someone's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov looks for that miserable loft in Paris. It is covered with cobwebs. Bricks are scattered and some paintings of the former occupant were left behind. The owner does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov points to a childish painting of a naked woman and laughs: "Ah, a fam fye-tal, eh?" Landlord laughs too, replies: "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, then that's her name!" Landlord: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) Is horny for Maggie Smith and should take her home, but tells her that she is taking "the scenic route". There is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signals. "Caution." "Lay-By" "Give up." "Production." Ending with the imperative "STOP / CHILDREN". There is another set up when Ustinov's scheme is about to be discovered by the board - foggy roofs, police cars, a hug from Maggie's farewell, ending with a sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I still can not get over Malden as the boss, stating decisively, "I never regret the decisions," then swallowing a handful of pills and washing them with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> The acting is unquestionably well. It's Bob Newhart's best role, for example. Not that he had so many, not that his range was not limited, but he is perfect in that part. The musical score of Laurie Johnson obviously had a lot of effort put into it. She seems to have written a brief concert for flute. Ustinov's passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by fake names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The false president of Stuttgart is someone called Schmidt, and he is an anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is beautiful, sexy, bourgeois, and ends up not being as dumb as she seems. <br /> <br /> Charming in its quiet way, but do not expect comic book fireworks.
