I loved this show ... Intelligent acting, intelligent dialogue, great plot with real people .... please bring it back or make it available online ... I really miss it .. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this insane world. Get rid of those idiot reality shows and give this show a second chance Please bring it back Do not humble yourself ... but please! When it went off the air, I watched online and enjoyed how I could watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, ABC online makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them in prime time ... the days of endless recordings . Whenever you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
