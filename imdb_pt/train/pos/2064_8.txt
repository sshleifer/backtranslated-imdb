ScareCrow was one of the funniest Killers I've ever seen in the act! Also, he is really bouncing most of the time he jumped, which was amazing! He, too, had an excellent voice, I mean that was perfect for him. The story lines were also excellent. I like how the soul of the kids was moved to ScareCrow which was cool! Besides, he had a reason for all that murder I want to say after what those people did to him ... I'd be angry too! ScareCrows look was very good! your look gives that person an "OMG!" reaction when they see it! Which was great, the looks he got were funny! Those people were idiots, they watched for so long! They should have looked and ran for their lives ... even if it did not make a difference!
