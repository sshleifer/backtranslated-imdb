Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about the so-called theory that we are all bound by someone. Focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this show, it did not catch my eye. It seemed very ordinary, actually. So I saw a few episodes ... and I loved it! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is an alcoholic addict, a woman whose betrothed betrays her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troublesome brother, and so on ... Contrary to what we are accustomed to, most characters interact with each other the others. in casualties, as in our daily routines. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> So the cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", here shows his acting skills in a 3d character more than his previous work as Paxton. The others also give great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb, after watching a few episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that you do not have more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!
