This is a horror movie TV show that hits you. Friday the 13th the series had no connection with the cinema. Poltergeist the legacy: I'm not so sure. It may have been loosely connected to the movies. It seems they just throw a famous title at a show for fans to watch. <br /> <br /> This shows Freddy being burned by the parents of Elm Street (in the first episode I believe) and the amount of parents was disappointing. With all the kids he's targeted in the first 3 movies, you'd expect there to be more parents. But it's alright. <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically the show's narrator. He watches people's actions in the real world, sometimes getting involved in some way. Just as other anthologies shows as Tales of the Crypt, there is a supernatural touch or final surprise involved. <br /> <br /> The acting is lacking, but believe it or not: violence sometimes outweighs that of the movie. This show lasted a few seasons and was made at the time of the 4th film. I heard it was canceled due to Protestant parents. I watched a lot of things about R as a kid, so it's a shame that parents have to ruin everything for everyone. Four more films came after the series, so it was not a total loss.
