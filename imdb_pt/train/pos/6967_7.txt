A prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick as well as the new co-creator of the series Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is defined in the twelve colonies about 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series, in addition to its human drama, also chronicles the major steps in the development of what would become the Cylon race. <br /> <br /> The pilot and the series should follow two families; the Graystone, which includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and business tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while Adama's include Joseph (Esai Morales) a lawyer and his son William the future admiral by Battlestar Galactica. Like Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some great experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some talented relatively new actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For fans of Battlestar Gallactica, there are similarities and continuities with this series, but it is also very different. In the pilot, at least, the elements of science fiction are definitely present, but are a minor part of this series. The scenes in Caprica, while reflecting a more technologically advanced society, also have a retro feel, this is achieved through a bit of architecture, costumes and the way it is filmed. Although the appearance and feel of the two series has some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the rarely played racial theme in BG is much more important. We also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether a machine may or may not have one as well as issues related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The pilot was released directly to the DVD in an extension and unrated version before airing on the TV, the series is scheduled to begin in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver
