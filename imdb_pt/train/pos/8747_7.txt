* Possible Spoilers * Although done before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace still impresses me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two girls who travel through Thailand and be arrested on drug trafficking charges. Was it Alice by Clare Danes? Was Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Was it the beautiful stranger they met on their journey? None of this really matters, as this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits that can be extended. Play Bill Pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as your Thai fiancee (and better lawyer than he) and we have a little story that catches the eye of the public. Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for any reason - it is not an original concept, it does not show sensationalist violence that leads to the avant-garde crowd talking about their "brave realism" or "hard truths" - is merely a good story with some great performances. Bill Pullman is weaker with his lazy talking and husky talking - I was very bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, though decent, is nothing spectacular. It acts well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is in good shape, creating a sympathetic and defined character where, really, there is not much to work with. <Br /> <br /> But make no mistake - this is the Clare Danes movie. I've been a fan of her work for a long time, and that does not change. She captivates all the scenes in which she appears, and if it were not for her, the film would probably bow to boring things. I particularly applaud her performance on the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
