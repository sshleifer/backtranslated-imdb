I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie, and it created a sense of the time that seems like time travel. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong combination for Byron, Claire is a little annoying, Polidori is a convincing crook ... all are beautiful, curious and decadent ... not the scary wrecks they are. in Gothic style. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and I loved it for different reasons, but this works as a Merchant and Ivory film, and it was from my readings better capture than the summer must have seemed. Romantic, yes, but it completely revives my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think of the movie. One of my all time favorites.
