I remember seeing it in the 1970s - so recently I borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With almost 30 years of hiatus, I came to another conclusion. Most of the directors interviewed in this series - some in the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (German navy chief) Anthony Eden (UK) - have long since left but their first reports hand will remain alive. Generals and admirals for sergeants, Russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, are all registered here. <br /> <br /> I remember the interview of Lord Mountbatten (died in the 1970s) <br /> <br /> This is really a jewel and I believe that the producer of this series was awarded by Queen Elizabeth for this job. - well deserved. <br /> <br /> Seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" I have ever given, but I have discovered it as a good bottle of wine, it is most appreciated with a little time ...
