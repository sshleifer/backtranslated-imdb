Love is overwhelming ... In everything it is manifestations ... Beautiful, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story about love in all its forms, a story about indecipherable ways Of young hearts, about life and lost innocence, all led by the skilful eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With a magnificent soundtrack with Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche surprises in every way leaving behind the bitter taste of misunderstanding love ... Truly remarkable ... It is me or the Romanian cinematography, slowly but surely, to win respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Two thumbs up for everyone involved.
