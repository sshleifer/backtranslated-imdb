The story of peaceful farmers and townspeople struggling for land, water, law and order, and the respect and ultimate subjugation of entrenched livestock interests and their cannons were best worked on in previous films (Shane) and probably later as well. There are some good action scenes and the overall layout of the story, excluding a disappointing ending, is well executed. Law, order, and religion have taken root in the city, but the old order of cattle, cowboys, and gunmen is still around. The clash of the two takes place in a well-staged ambush scene, where villagers head straight for a trap. Granger, a former gunslinger, plays the guy who is avoided by the city's own people who need their expertise with a gun.
