What a beautiful and delicious movie! The story is incredibly good with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly impressed by the cool, graceful beauty of director Masayuki Suo's wife and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On last September 6, I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and found a delightful entertainment. But now I can say that is another unnecessary remake, and I recommend this original movie. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dance With Me?" ("Dance with me?")
