Delicious movie directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film is also launching some of the great actors of our time, not just from France, but from everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: 14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and to understand her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: There was probably no better way to start this movie than with this segment of romantic Paris. Lieu du 16ème: an image of Paris of which we have been more aware since the riots in the Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's son (she is a nanny) than herself. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: A lot of fun to see Gérard Depardieu as the "bar tenancier" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Do not tell me you did not like these pampering! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: It's a treat to see Steve Buscemi as the tourist making a loud contact (a no-no) with a girl on the subway. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to return! <br /> <br /> Seen in Barcelona (another great city) in Verdi on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
