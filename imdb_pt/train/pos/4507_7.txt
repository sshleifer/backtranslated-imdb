I was really impressed with how much a movie, over 60, could impress me. They are almost two hours long, there is absolutely no star, there are subtitles, but it is interesting and exciting to watch. What struck me most was the realism of the film. You could almost feel the coldness of the ice because you could see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI world like our days. I wondered how much work it should have been for van Dyke. I read somewhere that took 17 months to film it. Now who wants more talk about 'Titanic'? It's a great movie with a great message and I recommend to future directors who see how great and realistic movies can be if they are directed only with realism rather than visual effects.
