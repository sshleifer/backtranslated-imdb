This is the movie I've seen more often than any other (I believe I saw it on average once a year since it was released). And every time I see it, it's equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was probably a combination of the best that ever existed in the ex-Yu filmmaking. This movie is an absolute must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce poconi krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac in sluzbenom putu. This is a movie poker that everyone should have in their particular collection of videos.
