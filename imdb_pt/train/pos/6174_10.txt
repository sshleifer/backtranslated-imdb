It really is unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mountaineers and hockey players. This movie is the second superlative Canadian film I've seen in recent weeks (the first one was "The Red Violin"), far better than all the best efforts of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is an employee of the middle-aged Parsian bank in Bombay in the 1970s. This film explores sensibly various things that happen to him about his family, his friends and his work, and its effect on him. At the same time, it is fascinating and, I suppose, an accurate portrayal of middle-class urban life in India at the time. <br /> <br /> However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as you would expect, can not capture all the intricacies of the book, but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good movie, read and see "A Trip So Long."
