I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and refused co-starring with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in her prime has never left her side of the pond to make American musical films. If they had joined for this movie, it would have been a once-in-a-lifetime event. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because Damsel in Danger has everything else for that. Fred Astaire, story and adapted to the screen by the author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy and songs by the Gershwin brothers. In response to the question asked by Nice Work If You Can Get It, there is not much you can ask for more for this movie. <br /> <br /> Except a protagonist. Although Ginger Rogers has made several films out of Fred Astaire, Maiden in Peril is the only film Astaire did without Rogers while they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was climbed to this side opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her character has nothing that Ginger Rogers shares in these films. All she basically has to do is act sweet and demure. It also does not contribute anything musically. And if I had to evaluate all of Fred Astaire's dance partners, Joan Fontaine would come out at the bottom. The poor woman is horrible in the number of things they are looking for. <br /> <br /> When she later co-starred in a musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it is not by chance that Fontaine has nothing musical to do. <br /> <br /> The version I have is a colorful one and in this case I think it really worked well. The idyllic and green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is actually brought in this copy on VHS. Especially in that number I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine that happens in the garden. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen, on the other hand, as a couple of vaudeville soldiers complement Astaire in style in the Stiff Upper Lip number. . The surreal sequence of the amusement house is beautifully staged. <br /> <br /> Q. The aristocracy of Wodehouse goes against Constance Collier in her best arrogant and for the first time Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a good man in the movies. <br /> <br /> The biggest success of The Damsel in Danger is A Foggy Day, perhaps the best-known song about the British capital since London Bridge Is Falling Down. Made in Fred Astaire's most elegant and simple way, it's one of those songs that will last as long as London lasts and even later. <br /> <br /> Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, The Maiden in emergency rates like a classic, classic score, classical dance, classic comedy. Who could ask for anything else?
