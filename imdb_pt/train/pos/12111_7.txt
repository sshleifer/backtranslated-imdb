When I first started watching this anime I never thought something about making bread could actually be interesting but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started watching it, anime just entered the world of baking, I became addicted. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, which is very clever and very funny, with some recurring jokes. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these drawbacks are not seen so much in the early episodes, because of the great work in this anime, it actually begins to appear in the last 20 episodes when the reactions and recurring jokes they just grow old, and they're not as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, if this anime had ended with episode 52 I would have given a 9, but the last episodes only leave a bitter taste, which unfortunately can not be washed by the incredible 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
