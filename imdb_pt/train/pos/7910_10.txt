When this first came out, my father brought it home, we were surprised by it, it was so unlike anything we had seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found 'The Mind's Eye' again. The box is falling apart, and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it's not 'Finding Nemo' quality graphics, it's still very good. They should sell it again - it's a milestone for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
