I really enjoyed watching this movie. I recorded while watching so I could review it later. I really enjoyed the second more show since I was able to absorb more of the clever dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought the way this story evolved was very thought-provoking. I was very intrigued by the way Natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends, at first it seemed like she was going to puke a lot of animosity, but once she started interacting more pleasantly I had to see how this visit would unfold. I was not dissapointed. Gradually the secrets Sara kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not as perfect, an imperfect human being as most of us who wanted her freedom from a dominating mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn from one way very painful way that sometimes really loves someone you have to give them freedom. The viewers who accompanied this film to the end saw a very touching performance of Diane Keaton (which is always wonderful, even in some of her less well received films - think Town and Country). The final scene of Diane Keaton driving home was worth waiting for, revealing that anyone who loves another human being has to learn that we have to live our own lives, we love others, but we do not own them, and finally we have to leave go. It's a difficult lesson, but it's worth looking at now and then. Thanks to CBS for this broadcast, it was worth the long wait.
