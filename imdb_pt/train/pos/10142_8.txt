Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical things, but this one was under my skin (excuse the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to be exaggerated and as satisfying as arriving in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I feel feeling very hatred for the farrier and a lot of sympathy for the "screwee", I felt myself shrink and feel disgust at certain times which is really a rare and enjoyable thing for a horror spectator a little tired as I same. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but come out as tribute rather than imitation. It's a heavy piece that does not offer much to the viewer, but I like being mugged from time to time. This piece brings and does not apologize. I really liked this one. Do not watch while eating pudding.
