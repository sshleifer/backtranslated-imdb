In a poor village in Mexico, the Colonel (Fernando Luj√°n) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola still laments the death of her son Augustin some time ago. The colonel has been waiting for his fighter pension in a war against the Catholic church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget about this old struggle. Without having any possession or money but a valuable game, they struggle to survive with the expectation of the government recognition letter, recognizing the law and paying the late pension. This slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of most retired seniors in third world countries. In Brazil, most retirees have to survive at about $ 80 a month. The Colonel's debts in history were made to pay a graveyard for his son, otherwise he would be buried as a homeless man. Excellent performance of the cast, in a very sad story that is true in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): ('Do not write to the colonel') (Do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
