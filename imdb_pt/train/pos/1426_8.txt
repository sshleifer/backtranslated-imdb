I have to say that sometimes "looks" is all that matters, as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC pointed out (not about our land but he is right anyway). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to looks, this movie is an unbelievably stunning beauty that you will love what your eyes are about to see. <br /> <br /> And also has the personality of the film, interesting, with a catchy narrator voice and narrator. stories that will touch your soul as you watch these superbly shot images. <br /> <br /> The movie will probably not affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but you will surely remember how precious our land we live in is. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic documentaries on Earth that I really liked.
