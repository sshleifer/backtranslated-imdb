"The father is still far from the business" was the headline of a critique after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many think that the same unique expression of Kusturica is still present in their new movie and is something that critics can not touch it. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica is suffering from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, he is still unique and untouched. Surprisingly good performance of Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and less landscapes, in "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a world-class fatal potential, please do not ruin everything. Certainly, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
