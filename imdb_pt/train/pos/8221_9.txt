Sudden Impact is the 4th of Dirty Harry's films and one of the best features of these films is that they do not degrade the quality of one film to another. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another exciting ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry tries to solve a series of murders during the holidays. Harry is always at work, it seems. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he throws all his men into action, slow, deliberate and fearless. As the first of the Dirty Harry movies to be made in the 1980s, Sudden Impact does not have a bit of the '70s featuring the first three movies. This does not mean that the quality is lower. In summary: Full of intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another valuable addition to the Dirty Harry series.
