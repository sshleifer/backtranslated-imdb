I just love this movie. It is a perfect example of the surprising and complete stories that emerge from Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two films. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and beautifully rendered. The Hollywood version is just the opposite. I was horrified when I first saw the trailer for the remake of the US version and who was starring. It is the typical gross and unoriginal commercialism of Hollywood in the worst case. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The ONLY reason the original movie was not seen more widely is the American public's aversion to legends. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for this movie ever to work in an American narrative is that the reserved, ultraconservative socially persona of the Japanese persona persona is concerned in this movie. Certainly the main character awakens to a fuller understanding of living a lively life through dance, but half the tension in the film comes from stereotypes and ridiculous ballroom dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please, try to see this movie in its original form, not the terrible full screen. And please DO NOT skip the American remake ... it's a shallow farce in comparison to the original Japanese movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people will probably soon see this and the new US remake. <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I'm going to make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding - I first list this for a reason, outstanding movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian confused identity flic! 3.Shiri - A Korean action photo that blends Asian flare and American style 4.Run Lola Run - A German film that integrates the soundtrack of techno ingeniously. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list anyway :-)
