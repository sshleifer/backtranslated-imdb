I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, witty ... It does not make sense to tell about the content of the film because then I would be giving the result! You have to see without knowing what it is! Everything is connected and has its why and why. It starts subtly and then things start to roll faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane explosion you can imagine! It's even more fun watching the movie for the second time, after knowing all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real work of art! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
