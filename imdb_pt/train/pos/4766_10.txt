It is unusual to see a film in which the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest, if any, without its presence. <br /> <br /> Despite a not-so-excellent direction - there are actually many scenes that seem to have been filmed very quickly and carelessly - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a deprived priest and another week, the presence of Pierre. Fresnay is so impressive that we were shocked from the beginning to the terrible end. <br /> <br /> I have never seen or can imagine for the future a better performance, even Paul Scofield acting in "A Man for All Seasons". In fact, the end could be considered even more ridiculous if Fresnay was not playing the upset priest who returns to church committing a crime. "(" I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest ") is said with such brilliance that one can forget the mad Ness that led to that end. The other impressive thing that this film has is a single scene in which Morand - who despite being a defrocked is still a priest - consecrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into the blood of Christ. Gérard - the man who wants to give Morand back to the Church or replace him with himself - has to drink if he does not want to leave him in the cabaret. . He does this amid applause and applause from people who think he is simply drinking three of four rows of vine. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dial-up between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you take men, too?" asks Morand, who hates himself for what he has just done. "That would be a lot of work," is the smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not worth commenting on but certainly worth seeing because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange film, but it has to be seen by all the spectators - if they are good Catholics it is obligatory - because it is a very rare jewel in the history of the cinema. <br /> <br />
