"Read My Lips" tells of a strange symbiosis between a simple, socially grumpy office worker (Devos) and his in-house trainee, a former worker (Casel). As the film gives account of this unlikely pair, they engage in a frightening fusion of minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary result. Good things for anyone in movies driven by characters with strong psychodramatic tendencies. In French, with captions easy to read and good translation. (B +)
