"Purple Rain" has never been a critique darling, but it's a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you are a fan of Prince, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and he falling in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is comforting. Sometimes it comes out funny, but when it works, it really works. Very hit and miss. <br /> <br /> No one can really act in the movie. All are on one side of Prince, such as "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Still, it adds charm to the film. Whenever Prince is on the screen, it lights up and it's fun to watch him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go and see this if you love Prince like me. If you are not a fan, you will be one.
