This is the best Emma there is in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996), which is also good, and reading the book, I think I can safely say that this is the true interpretation and is most faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, it's almost like a completely different story. It's very light and fluffy, you do not see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a nice movie, this would do well, but the intricacies of some of the plot's points, such as the entanglement of Churchill / Fairfax is so overcast as virtually nonexistent. But if you want the characters to be a bit more realistic and multidimensional, the TV version of 1996 is the top one. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is a failure. Kate Beckinsale is masterful in showing the character's little quirks. You see her seem casually disgusted with some of Harriet Smith's simpler conversations, but she shows no remorse for ruining Harriet's proposal until this action has the effect of ruining her own marital bliss in the end. You see their narcissism and this is a reflection of Frank Churchill, for they would harm others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​she was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to spend time with after having suffered the loss of her housekeeper for the wedding. For Frank Churchill, it is to guarantee the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret. In the book, she realizes all this in an overwhelming awakening of all the mistakes she made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse, but Paltrow's is more childish and stagnant, while Beckinsale's awakening is quite real and serious, and you see the transition from an egotistical infantile behavior to a gentle and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
