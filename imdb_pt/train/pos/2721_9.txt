The real story (Kansas 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two ex-convicts who stormed a remote home on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they encountered). Richard Brooks directed Capote's chilling and disturbing book about the reasons that led these children to crime (Are They Natural Assassins?). The crime scenes are very brutal and haunting due to the lack of senses and reasons for what we witness. Stunning black and white cinematography from Conrand Hall, excellent country - road soundtrack from Quincy Jones, incredible performances in two leading roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and for the first time in a movie a sad commentary on capital punishment in the last moments before of their deaths. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and screenwriter for adapted script) are nominated for an Oscar. Exciting, superbly directed and scary, one of the best films of this decade
