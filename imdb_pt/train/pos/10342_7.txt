Melvyn Douglas once again presents a polished performance in which, this time, he takes on the role of a detective who fails to put love before duty and adventure, and the warmly beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far from being illiterate , as a critic suggested), wrote a novel about his early life) is as enjoyable as ever as his ever-suffering girlfriend. It's almost a crazy comedy, almost a Thin Man movie, almost a series, I think, that did not come to a sequel. He does not reach the status of classic but has all the ingredients for 85-minute fun with an episodic but rhythm-driven script, character actors and directing that keeps everything moving fast enough so you do not realize that Williams (Douglas ) is not exactly Columbus when it comes to detecting. I wish there were more movies like this.
