This is a very unusual movie in which the star with the top billing does not appear literally halfway. However, I was engaged on the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis, though competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson, seems a bit difficult to be nice (maybe he should have scraped his mustache) and his behavior when he comes home should have convinced the police at least to some extent of his innocence. . While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I found his interpretation of the character extremely impressive. He is not an ordinary villain. The great actor Elisha Cook Jr. is once again in full form as the "little man with great ambitions." Her drums in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. This film, however, is carried by the very capable and graceful Ella Raines as the devoted would be Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her presence on screen is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of his work that I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see his other roles. The rest of the support cast is also more than competent. All in all a mystery film noir very gratifying that when viewed today conveys fully the dark and complex urban world that it is intended to. Recommended, 8/10.
