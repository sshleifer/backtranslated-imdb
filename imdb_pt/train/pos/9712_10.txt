Another review compared this group to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also appropriately. Yet another review exposed on the differences between comedy that we enjoy non-critical and black comedy, also deserves consideration. <br /> <br /> Watch the whole thing, all three series. In the end, all the characters are tied up and the pieces of the puzzle fit as well as a Douglas Adams novel. The detail and the complexities are amazing. Completely postmodern. Grumpy and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those who have thin skin or have no objectivity. Thought-provoking. At the same time, literal, figurative and surreal in disturbing ways. The darkest comedy I remember. <br /> <br /> And quite possibly the most wonderful thing I'll ever see.
