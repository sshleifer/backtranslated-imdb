I've seen this movie on TV for many years and I saw this movie when I recorded it on tape. I thought this was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all the films, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The performance was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot was not very convincing, but the script was well written. This movie may also be of interest to avid baseball fans. It does not apply directly to an action-packed sports movie. Applies directly to a good movie that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this movie. Overall, the movie was good, but not great. I give this movie a 7/10.
