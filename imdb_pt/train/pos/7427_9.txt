I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when I was only 16 while watching another movie. Oh !!!! like me and my best friend we were excited. we could not wait for the month until it arrived. I've seen this movie 17 times that year in the theater. I love love love this Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is brash and half-vulgar, but also shy and insecure with Babs and is so kind to watch again. When they always sing green in the studio and it comes in tune with their husky voice so different from the perfect notes coming from it, but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he's so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress as if she had even the long sweater and cap that was so much like what she wore. it came on TV at the right time and I have my daughters to watch, they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just because I was so involved in it at an age when everything was extreme, I do not know. The ending always leaves me in tears until today.
