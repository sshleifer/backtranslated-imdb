I never trust anyone's opinions about a movie. That goes for the critics, too. Of course, if you get positive reviews, fine and more, but most of the rave reviews I hate. I liked this movie for what it was, a fun movie. That takes you out of your life for a few hours and into a fictional character ... that's Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, just as she was in the first. Anyone who says she's horrible in this movie must have felt the same in the first b / c, she's back acting the same way she did in Wild Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she interprets it perfectly. Its linings are great, very much like the first. Who can forget in the first film when she says to the police, "If you're going to arrest me, do ... or get me out of here!" Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this. I was captivated by it. Her clothes, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, is worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I can not wait for this movie to be released on DVD without cuts, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are many twists, as in the first, including the ending!
