I thought King Solomon's Mines were beautifully made. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was superb, but her makeup and hair were not of the season, and always seemed to make her look out of place alongside the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was cool to see an experienced and sturdy actor in this role after watching movie after film with blond, light-skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was a great choice and I enjoyed every minute of that movie. This version can not be compared to the 1950 version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were credible, but the two media should be kept separate. I look forward to seeing this one more time, and I hope Patrick Swayze goes back to that kind of paper.
