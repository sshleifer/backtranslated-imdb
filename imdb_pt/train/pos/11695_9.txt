This is a great movie! No matter the low rating here. I really have no idea where this came from, they should be discussing a different movie then. Because I just loved it and thought it was a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> The story was so original and charming ... I really can not think of anything bad to say about it. It might have to be "your kind of thing", but, I saw it with my sister and my mother, and we were all taken by it. <br /> <br /> The acting was also very good, and this is hard to do in a movie like that. But I found all the characters very intriguing and friendly. <br /> <br /> I've always really liked Dougray Scott and found his new role very interesting. It's really hard to make me like a bad guy, but I've absolutely had no problem with that right now. Even more, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Everyone who loves a good thriller / drama who also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this movie, there is no doubt about it! Anyone who wants to see a movie with 80% bloodshed, should rent something else, though ... But I think the title already leaves that aside. This is a love story, I have not seen 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
