I saw this recently on a cable channel. The movie is great; is one of the few musicals I've seen that does not shy away from light and darkness. It depicts a bit of the splendor of the time along with much of the misery. Some of the dance sequences of the set piece are happening, I did not know where to look next. One day I'll see it on the big screen, just to see what's going on. But what really raises it to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a completely evil and menacing man, but there is something else, some inner demons. It gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. It was almost as if the character Sykes was on the brink of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was 'just' a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room.
