Worst movie of all time? Wow, whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you. I live in Oregon so I began to enjoy the beautiful footage of Smith Rocks family and yet incredibly beautiful and other areas in central Oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking at the baby crib Sissy at beginning of the movie). Only those were enough to encourage me to give the film a better score than the average. <br /> <br /> Or ... Maybe it's all about the expectations you have. Having read the book AGES behind, and thinking to myself, "Goodness, no one could ever make a movie of this interesting, peculiar and strange book ... especially 20 years later, when morals (MORAYS - can not be included) accent mark online) have changed "- I was quite pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie for the first time in 1994 and even enjoyed watching it again today. <br /> <br /> Sissy was exquisitely scaled, and I do not care what everyone else says, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not a lesbian either bi or trans, but I've met a lot of people who are similar to the people they should portray - and those "real" ones who acted the same way these actors acted. Stilted a little, stage-ey - always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is an Oregonian native, but by chance he did a good job adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
