This film is a book of lyrical and romantic memories told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy who lives in a rural Cuban town in the year of the Castro revolution. It is a work genuinely worthy of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are mere attempts to erroneously market this as an action movie. DREAMING FROM JULIA makes a lot more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and revolution is only a drawback to people's daily lives and activities. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works that deal with this period in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> Excessive use of the narration narrator weakens the story, but the film offsets the lack of qualification. clips of Hollywood movies that say much more visually than the narrator could. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and are fair, since the film is melancholic in relation to the films, but there is an underlying pain to the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses the lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the movie JULIE, seems to never have an end.
