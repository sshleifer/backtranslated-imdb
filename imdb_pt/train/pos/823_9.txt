Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I always looked at that 1983 entry as my favorite movie in the long series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry forest creatures, etc.) made this film a particularly attractive film. <br /> <br /> None of the actions focused much on one point. The last half hour exemplifies this further as the scene shifts every few minutes from the woods to the battle between spaceships for the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another interesting feature of this film had that the previous two was not the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. It was the incessant fight between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was good to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.
