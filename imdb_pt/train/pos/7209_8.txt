I bought certain movies on disk, although second-class presentation was not an option. A certain company that I do not identify here has published several pan and scan DVDs ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80", and this one, to name but three!) From movies I do not think anyone wants to see. in this compromised format. Some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are only in their theatrical version of 1.66: 1. That of my chest, I'll say "Deathtrap" was a scary and strangely enough and fun image. My only complaints are the small score (what is that instrument that is usually dragged to films in 18th century France?) And Dyan Cannon screaming at regular intervals. Could not her character have been an asthmatic who took an inhaler when she was stressed? Minor complaints, both. The benefits of discs include being able to move quickly beyond those things you do not like. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a staged version of "Deathtrap," so having these people in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time. Before the Broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg, the theater was more accessible to ordinary people. Now anyone who pays less than a king's ransom to get live entertainment will probably not go to a successful show in the best way. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both great and virile specimens in the early 1980s and this is essential for how we will react to their profession and general image here. They definitely are not bookish men who can not fight or retreat from an obstacle. The two are equally great, as their criminal stubbornness becomes the last "deadly trap."
