Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Return of the Jedi is not good because it's really fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! This is bad! Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it. Now, suddenly, people look at you as if you have some sort of illness if you mention how much you like it. This movie is much better than anything Kevin Smith ever considered creating, which surprises me that the man does not even think about reporting it. This movie is so much fun! It's as incredible as I remember when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing the opinions of Kevin Smith! He is not correct! <br /> <br /> And that song of Ewok in the end prevailed! I bet you guys do not even like "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'll set you all on fire!
