I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it is a typical romance between boy and girl, but it is done with such elegance and care that time passes. Henstridge (talks about winning the pool-lottery lottery!) Is as magnetic and seductive as ever (who says the golden age of the movie theater is dead?) And Vartan stands. <br /> <br /> There is a bustling chemistry between the two leads; the movie is more alive when they share a scene - a lot! It's done so well that you're willing to come together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you're feeling a little sad, watch this movie, you'll feel so much better. If you are already happy then you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, I'm from the UK and I'm a hopeless romantic yet looking for your Princess ...)
