I read Pearl S Buck's splendid novel for the first time in my ninth year history class and took advantage of all the exciting pages of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get hold of it, and considering it was done in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Certain things have to be accepted: in 1937, no actors were cast in a major Hollywood movie. In a way, this makes the end product more interesting than if they could use a more authentic-looking cast. <br /> <br /> With this obstacle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to choose a splendid and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the height of his powers as an actor during this period, and could almost play whatever he thought. Once you outgrow makeup (it's fine, but no one's really going to confuse you with a Chinese), your performance has all the likelihood of your best work. <br /> <br /> So, there's Luise Rainer. Coming from an Oscar win last year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the star of the Viennese actress was on the rise and was cast as O-lan despite her lack of Hollywood experience. His performance earned him a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history that happened. <br /> <br /> Many criticisms have been made of Rainer's performance, and his Oscar has won here. It was called wood and a note. There's a little grain of truth to it. However, with that said, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, although not Chinese, interpreted O-lan as Buck wrote it; is, in fact, a splendid performance and one of the best book-to-screen transfers I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, well, that was MGM. They had the biggest list of stars and characters in Hollywood at the time, and a great budget to pay the best, and in the end they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film softens the marriage of Wang Lung with O-lan a little. In romance, with wealth comes the lust of the flesh and he assumes a concubine, a movement that plagues his wife, but his feelings as a mere woman do not concern him. In the film, a contrite Wang Lung returns to his wife on his deathbed the two pearls he had taken from his years before, realizing too late that she was his true love. Corny, yes. But this is Hollywood. Given the obstacles they faced, the film could have burst out laughing. But despite the notable shortage of true Asians in the cast, this film did surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is how good it is, when it may have been such an easy disaster.
