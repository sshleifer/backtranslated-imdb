Even though The Shining is more than a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone not to be frightened by Jack Nicholson's downfall into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one was able to pull it off; instead, it has been referenced repeatedly in pop culture. The twins, the blood-lift, RedRum, the crazy absurd "writing" ... this should be seen, if not for nothing, to understand all the allusions to him in everyday life. The film is both scary, full of suspense, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what is usually lacking in horror movies: a great script.
