"Pandora's Clock" is an exciting suspense / thriller that is a cross between a virus film and a disaster film. This movie, which aired on two parts on NBC in its 1996 debut, is about an airplane flight that is infected with a virus when one of the passengers is carrying this disease. The US government is debating whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus specialist (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure out something to avoid the disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked "Pandora Watch". It's a hell of an exciting ride. Jane Leeves ("Frasier" from TV), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also star. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
