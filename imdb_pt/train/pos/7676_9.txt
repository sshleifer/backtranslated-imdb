Bright! My wife and I joined the queue to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long queue. Holly is a poignant story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, he is a worn out westerner. The film gripped every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is difficult to watch - it is the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the stomach. The film is beautifully filmed. Among others, we love the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. The crudity of Thuy Ngoyen (I do not believe this is his first acting job) and the performance of Ron Livingston stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
