Running Man cruelly satirizes the modern American media complex and reaches its target. It can be an easy target, but they do not do it less. RM effortlessly assumes pro-wrestling (with some professional fighters like the Hunters), television network, Nielsen ratings, the US government (suggesting that it is entertainment oriented anyway), crime and punishment, and a half dozen other things along the way. It's a long way from the original Stephen King novel, and Arnold is not Ben Richards of the novel either. But who cares? It's basically an Arnie movie, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and catch phrases that such an undertaking demands.
