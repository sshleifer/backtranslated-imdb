I really liked this movie and it was kind of hard to do that when your brother is making stupid comments in 30 seconds. But this movie I liked, mainly because I am accustomed to the usual HK action movies. Most movies like this do not watch the story, watch the foolish action. And meaningless action is right. You get to see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and avoid innumerable bullets. It's true that this movie was released to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. That's one reason the indexes for this movie fell. Most people probably expected to see a movie as polished as an American movie. But you have to remember that most of HK's film budgets are not as high as an American movie, and the style of an HK action movie is often very different, usually requiring a lot of work on many of them. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see this, just try to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
