Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie really boils down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura repeats some scenes in the fight scenes that appear in the second half of the movie, but that's where the similarities end. Versus occurs essentially everywhere, showing Kitamura's ability to create an interesting B movie in natural locations. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small, tight spaces. Here, the art design is put on your face and the artistic design it is! We are treated with many very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are, for the most part, confined to these spaces. Also a fundamental difference is that we do not have much action here until the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and cool, here much more emphasis is placed on characters and situation and fiddling with your mind. Because of this, Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You may not show up and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of zombie bloodshed, but you'll be stuck on the screen for almost two hours observing the interaction of some genuinely interesting characters. <br /> <I'm now in awe that I ordered the DVD, though some naysay. You should too! But do not forget to realize that this is a different animal from Versus - it's often slow, and requires a little thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters will take you to the release of the R1 DVD with subtitles!
