After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never made it to theaters, so I ordered BluRay. I had a lot of fun watching and I have to say that this movie is better than some great animation films out there. Of course, it has its flaws, but I can still recommend it. The animation is well done, very fun and unique and the story kept me watching until the end. Some of the scenarios are beautiful and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought that Forest Whitaker's performance seems a bit lifeless, but that's how the Lian-Chu character is portrayed in this movie. So overall, I really enjoyed it, I really enjoyed it, and hopefully it's successful enough that all the studios involved keep making great movies like that. I would recommend taking a chance and being surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget. Hektor is only worth watching the movie, since some of his moments are hilarious.
