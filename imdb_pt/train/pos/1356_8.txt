I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really enjoyed it. The first thing that draws attention to this is the refreshing format, which, while similar to many other reality shows at its core, is still a lot of fun. Donald Trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well. The casting blow with smart people having good looks being chosen as competitors is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of crap in his time, but his way of dealing with cinematography is excellent, since he makes NYC look like a character in himself. The jazz tunes, combined with great cameras, make New York look spectacular. <br /> <br /> The Apprentice will always do my first 3 reality shows of all time (The Incredible Race is Number 1, however). But just like the incredible race, this show is always best attended in moderation. If you keep watching for a while, the originality of the show will end quickly (the same with TAR). Star World, the broadcasters in this country, did a great job presenting the program. The first three seasons were shown followed, after 2 years the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept up to date. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you'll love this show, especially the first two seasons. However, if you continue to watch the show continuously, your charm will disappear and FAST.
