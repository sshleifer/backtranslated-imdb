And a quite unexpected plot too - for the time: there's Prague in the city of New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! The trademark affairs of Elia Kazan: waterfronts, workers, crowds, fugitives, blue-collar people, violence in a backstreet-are all featured here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as the Mafioso cold off by a big score, Zero Mostel as Don Delouise a little miscast, but certainly watchable as his go-fer. I liked Barbara Bel Geddes as the strong and cool woman - I thought she and Widmark were a believable couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me a little of Sinatra-in the face and in the intense, quiet way-and that means a compliment, if there is anything. I had never heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire the performance of Widmark. I also liked Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, they make an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you have to know that it's not exactly done the way it would have been in real life rather than small-scale, at least not? -But I thought it took the plot along well. <br /> <br /> Check this out. It's good. *** outta ****
