The second in the Why We Fight series focuses on Hitler's take on Sudetanland and beyond, while he makes a surprise with Neville Chamberlain and embarks on his European conquest. <br /> <br /> Clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series on the test of time became an informative documentary, as well as with most of the "Allies bias", becoming a historical fact. The FÃ¼hrer stands on his own firecracker with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves eastward. The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulated, but the Poles waged a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. The disparity between Hitler's and Chamberlain's military power waving the Munich treaty as a white flag declaring "Peace in our time" to this day has enduring propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more powerfully as the gloom of World War II settles in Europe, leaving the American viewer with two options: freedom or slavery. In 1943, there was no evasion of this simple truth and The Nazis Strike makes its point of view effectively.
