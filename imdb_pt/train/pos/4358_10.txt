Okay, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted "10" to help offset the misleading rating of the handful of bozo that gave this film zero or 1 star rating. Each of the segments of this anthology shows great potential and promise to talented filmmakers ... three of whom have achieved remarkable success in large Hollywood productions. The performances go all the way up to quite impressive, with notable shifts by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a big and melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarre strobe lamp, and Lance August seems intentionally moody as an unsuspecting laboratory victim. But overall, it has great laughs and some genuinely scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, then judge for yourself!
