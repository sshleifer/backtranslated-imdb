Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a handsome young bum who arrives at a bar on the road. Meet the young, beautiful and unhappy Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), owners of the bar. He trades his mechanical skills with some food and lodging, and has an affair with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Giuseppe, forging a car accident. Their relationship is affected by guilty feelings and police investigations. This masterpiece ends tragically. Luchino Visconti's noir and neo-realist film is excellent. This is the first time I see this version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner, and the 1981 version where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in movie history, but this is certainly the best. My vote is ten.
