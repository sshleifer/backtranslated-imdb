Well ... Vivah is a good movie, but typical of Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not extremely good. <br /> <br /> The big plus of the film is Shahid and Amrita's direction, music and acting (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor of Indian film --- A girl being disgusted by her stepmother. The story is the film is a bit ordinary, but it's good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Negative point is a common history of the Bollywood movie. Overall, I would say that it is a must watch movie twice, if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and love of course!
