I saw this movie for the first time at a festival. There were a lot of good movies, but few made me think a lot about it, and An Insomniac's Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The shots were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in her role that she created perfectly. There was not much to know about her character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we care about it. And Ellen, I can not wait to see where it ends! She is showing a lot of talent and I hope she does some more movies. With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, Tess shows that everything is not necessary as long as there is a good story and actors. Lots of compliments to everyone involved with this movie. And thanks to Tess and co. to distribute on DVD!
