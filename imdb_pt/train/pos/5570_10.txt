Sophmoric this movie is. But it's funny how everyone leaves. It shows the "boys' locker room mentality" being played by the "other side". It's good to see these tides turned and how stupid they are. But that's probably not news to most women, because (just ask one), "they've heard it all before." <br /> <br /> Watch with a small group or group of mixed genres and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours in a row. And the other 2.7% ... can you really please them?
