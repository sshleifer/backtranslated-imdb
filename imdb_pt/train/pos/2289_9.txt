I'm a pretty pedestrian person, with a little lowbrow tastes. Occasionally, however, I try to raise the level of my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was impressed all through the movie. I enjoyed it so much that I got my own tape to see again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally impressive film. I saw this as a huge issue for the viewer: What is the depth of the sacrifice for duty that someone can accept, can be asked to accept, must accept? As a military member, this is obviously an important issue for me. This issue weighs heavily on the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
