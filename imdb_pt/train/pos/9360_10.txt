Let me start by saying that at the tender age of 34 I was suddenly a widow. I was devastated as he was not sick - he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary - his carotids exploded - he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from the police because he fell for something and hit his head. I was a murder suspect until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as I was, as much in love with a good father figure as he was. I had three small children, with no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. Within two years my in-laws attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually demanding that I do not suffer in front of the children, and put on masks and show people what they wanted to see, did not show them my pain during the holidays ... No one stood up for me and my choice to stay on vacation, except, of course, the pain therapist I was seeing, who advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws did not understand! FOREVER changed my relationship with them, and I never came back for a holiday. This is just an example of how my pain was disrespected! My own (new) husband saw me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared my soul. I collapse, I can not breathe, I hyperventilate, and I usually get defunct for a few days, even though I try to transmit the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now, about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul got restless, my heart broken. My fears and pains have resurfaced from the real demons that this film presents; how one grieves compared to how others are expecting us as well as the inner demons. Adam Sandler perfectly portrayed the terrible agony you face, overcome, and, above all, work on your own time! This film has drained all the pain I've tried over the years to deal with. You see, when something hurts your soul so deep, so deep that the statements are everything that comes from your mouth at moments of thought, you can not handle it without wishing that you were dead and walking through life, in a dead state . <br /> <br /> The Bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26 to which I clung, so that when my mouth and my soul do not know what to pray, may the Holy Spirit of God carry that agony to the feet of God. "I do not need to talk. Sandler portrayed this to perfection! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which he was taken to an audience for mental health impairment purposes, and he comes back to face his in-laws --- (familiar to me) --- and he tells her they the awesome truths by which he was possessed, by himself, which he can not overcome. It is a profoundly strong and powerful performance. I started to cry and had a hard time after getting up to leave the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw firsthand my precise movements in trying to keep everything together; a lesson to him, my youngest who barely remembers his father. It's been 13 years for me, but this movie has brought me back to losing my in-laws forever, when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrender to their desires, instead of respect for my own. <br /> <br /> I write this, so that if you are a griever, you are prepared for this movie, but I highly recommend it in the performance of 1000 stars that Sandler gave. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a griever, please take a lesson from your movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their pain, letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not pronounce the words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go see this film with fabrics and not without preparing to take it ... to your soul!
