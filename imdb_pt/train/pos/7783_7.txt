A young woman surviving like a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap prostitute who wants to get a great score. <br /> <br /> They know each other in Thailand. You may think for the opening titles it's going to be a violent movie but it's also a love story with two people in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life. This movie looks like a rehearsal at times because of its image changes, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke, but it's well told," says one character, and this also applies to this: We saw the story, but in this way we see it. Thailand appears in warm tones, the photograph goes from a colorful place to a colorful one. And capture the city as the cage of these imperfect people. There is also good use of music to punctuate the actions.
