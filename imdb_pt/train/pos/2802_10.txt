As someone who has never played sports, it seems that it would be difficult for me to get into football (or, as we, Americans, inexplicably call it, football) - "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say, this was a cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her friend WASP, Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley), love to play football (yes, I will say in a British and international way) and love footballer David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents do not approve (her mother offers a very quick description of football at the beginning of the film). Okay, so maybe it was kind of clich√© in that sense, but you have to love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie without knowing the definition of "bow" in football ... do not worry, the film explains (I've also never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley was great: a few months after "BILB" appeared in the United States, she starred in the equally legal "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."
