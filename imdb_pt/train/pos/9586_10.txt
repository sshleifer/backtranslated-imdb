The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society in which we live. It is well done and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I believe he gives a great insight into a subculture that shakes the viewer's own ideas of society. It's shocking sometimes and more powerful because of it. Some parts were difficult to watch, as most are, but not over. It's good the first time you watch, but it gets better the second or third time; because you had the chance to wrap your mind around the same topics they discuss and challenge.
