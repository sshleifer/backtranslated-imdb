This movie has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this movie far outweigh the evils ... <br /> <br /> What is not so good in the film, sometimes it is the dialogue, the sounds, lighting (I am the only one who realized the way the sets were lit up was amateur, and the acting .... <br /> <br /> What is very good is the highly original plot, the very atmosphere intense, blood factor that is very high, and the effects that are done supremely. So definitely worth watching, or maybe even a must-see for all horror and gore fans ....
