The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, darkest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. So much so, it paved the way for more comedies of his own, many of which copied the style, but never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike all other sketches shown, the characters of the Gentlemen's League are all loosely connected. First, they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey, in the northern back of England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to welcome the newbies are Tubbs and Edwrad, the owners of a supposedly local store situated so far away that most locals probably do not know of its existence. Other oddities include: the Denton family, with an obsession for hygiene, chastity and frogs; Hillary Briss, who sells a special and fortunately unknown brand of meat; Pauline, a departing officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; Mr. Chinnery, good-hearted veterinarian and threatening all things on all fours; Geoff Tipps, a plastics salesman with a cruel sense of humor, often involving guns, and electric tubes. . . . . . . PLUMS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy at heart, The League of Gentlemen often transcends genres, though it never seems to be counterfeiting or stealing other people's material. There are several horror references, such as the disappearance of a walker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. Even more impressive are the moments in which the series takes on a more overlapping tone and the above mentioned characters, such as Pauline and Geoff, are shown in a more sympathetic and vulnerable light. The film adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide that they belong. <br /> <br /> The third equally underrated series also has a different path, instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each. plot leading to a conclusion involving a plastic bag and a fugitive theater company van. While many fans dislike the structure of the movie or third grade as much as the first two, they are certainly signs of how creative the Gentlemen's League can be and how they are not afraid to explore new areas. <br /> In short, the Gentlemen's League is definitely worth looking at, as the welcome signs say: you will never leave!
