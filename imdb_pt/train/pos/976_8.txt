Takashi Miike's incursion into the children's territory conquered me almost immediately because he shows courage and courage in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought there was something sinister about most fairy tales; Horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit more frightening (and more disturbing) than they appear to be at first sight. The filmmaker takes the archetypal story of a child in a wonderful quest from the preschool classroom. It accentuates the real fears of a world full of endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to minimize the seriousness behind sleeping stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. It goes to the jugular of the story, but it also shows signs of restraint. But a safe Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
