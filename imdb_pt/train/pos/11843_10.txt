Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a wonderful film. The mix of animation types is unique, the plot is amazing and the music is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Animation drawn is a special thing about many animations. As they expressed the characters, especially the horses, through their animation are especially spectacular. Although the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I would imagine that it would be challenging to express them through resources. Because of this, I understand the "eyebrow" they have added to horses (while real horses do not have those thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about the habits of horses that could have been portrayed in a strange way is that Spirit led her mother's herd. In wild horse stallions, the leading stallion usually chases the young foals. <br /> <br /> In addition, while some people may think of portraying white army officers as 'bad guys' are stereotypes, think of all the movies the Native Americans have been portrayed as. Sometimes at that time; they treated the mustangs very badly. For example, in actual history, the Appaloosa breed was almost exterminated due to Army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the world's most beloved races if the Native Americans had not saved them. <br /> <br /> I find it incredible how realism was not subtracted by making the horses talk to each other. . The feelings of the spirit were expressed by a little narration, but mainly through music (by Bryan Adams). The songs express the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The thrill I had when watching the movie, whether it's the first or the twentieth time. (yes, I watched so much), you would not believe. Some of the scenes take their breath away, while others seem to force tears into their eyes. The opening sequence, showing the homeland of the Spirit, puts you in spectacular action immediately. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why some people are so obnoxious about this brilliant movie. Overall, I rate it a 10/10 - a must watch.
