All the talent that Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 films, I thought they were all an accident, because his 4th album, the main premi ki diwani hoon, was so bad. But I have to say it was not an accident. This guy is talented and the way he did Vivah is just brilliant. From the first scene, it affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are impressive. The chemistry between these two actors gives a glimpse of this between srk and kajol. As usual Alok Nath as the good and loving father is fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita seems to be good at most scenes, although shahid seems a bit young to get married, but he does a good job with a shy but morally strong fianc√©. This film will be especially appreciated by those who have had such beautiful times in their lives. All in all a brilliant movie. we took off the hat to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
