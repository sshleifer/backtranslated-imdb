After her Oscar-nominated return in "Secrets & Lies", Brenda Blethyn starred in the equally great "Saving Grace." And let me tell you, this is not the kind of movie you encounter every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) learns that her irresponsible financial decisions have left her with massive debt. Fortunately, she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right, Grace begins to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> All aspects of this film were performed with great success; there is no tedious moment anywhere. And I certainly did not see that final scene coming! But anyway, you have to see this movie. You just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it. If nothing else, it can work as a good lesson on knowing your finances. But, of course, there is much more than that!
