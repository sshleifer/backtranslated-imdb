A fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to reach historical fame, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the passionate pursuit of the young Italian artist for the artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film features sumptuous costumes and sets and a good cast and acting. However, he is confused in his attempt to describe the esoterics of art and time and is little inspired by his depiction of the artist's passion as painted on canvas and explored through his engagements with men. A good movie for those interested in Renaissance painting or period films.
