I will not repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an excellent film, not just as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and a father. his grown son, but also as a small window into the world of the practice of Islam for those who, like me, are not very familiar with this religion. One important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude toward religion seems to change in subtle ways as we progress through his journey with them. <br /> <br /> This is very stimulating, enjoyable and stimulating. Well done film that I would recommend to anyone with brains and hearts.
