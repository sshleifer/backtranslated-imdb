well, this is a Ivan Reitman movie. with the rare exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are usually not "deep" but are fun enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me that I laughed more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is so great, and I love her portraits. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a direct pio. Never taking yourself seriously, the film is overdone and yet it is not unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before ... it is a good rental and probably a good movie, especially if you have a headache and I do not want to overload your brain. It's fun escapist and there is nothing wrong with that. When you take things out of "supergirl," you get a story about relationships and bad relationships. It's a boy knows girl, boy lets girl thing. And in the end, the characters are looking for love. Not all of them take being "dumped" as well as they could .... a slice of life with a twist.
