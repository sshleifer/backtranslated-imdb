I was not sure if I was watching a documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation. I think, given the production time, it was a mix of all three. <br /> <br /> It is true that the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be some interesting scenes while the movie continued. We were able to witness what appeared to be a realistic training regimen and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this movie got together for me was closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I realized) that I have not met many times before. You could take action and imagine the thoughts of the young fighters. This was mixed with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real Japanese actors would be a little scarce. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent as a source of the state of American mentality. in 1943, as the war waged with Japan. Also of interest was an excavation in the Japanese about the aid the US has given to Japan in recent years.
