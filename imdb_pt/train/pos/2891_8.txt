We watched it on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things should be tighter on the "Mouse" than normal. <br /> <br /> As this movie only lasts 74 minutes, and they had to move to 2 hours of TV broadcast time, they had, and I'm not inventing it, commercial breaks that lasted from 6 to 7 minutes . And during those commercial breaks, they had another ad in the form of a "TV show" presented by the annoying Kelly Rippa that proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True." new and again, break after break, Disney took time out of the actual movie to tell us, faithful viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequence. Thank you, Disney, for making us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this commercialism and cash ringing made it a difficult task to enter the market. real movie "Cinderella," because by the time the commercials were over, I'd forgotten where the story had stopped. <br /> <br /> But of course, the original "Cinderella" still retains its magic, and the story is still good, though we've all seen it countless times. It's a shame that they had to cheapen with all the marketing for what appears to be a lame follow up.
