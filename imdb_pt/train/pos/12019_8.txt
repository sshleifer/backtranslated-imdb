I saw this movie in Sky Cinema not long ago. I must admit, it was a very good Western, which features two of the big names .. On one side there is Charlton Heston, playing the infamous and retired lawman Samuel Burgade. On the other hand .. The late James Coburn playing villain Zach Provo .. seeking revenge on Burgade no matter what the cost .. The good thing about this movie was that there were some really good characters. Most of the actors played very well .. Especially James Coburn, who I think he was really mean in this movie .. But what it was like .. Christopher Mitchum, that I've seen at all places in other movies .. Playing Hal Brickman .. I felt his character was left out in the cold, but he managed to get together in partnership with Burgade, to take down the platoon of Provo! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great movie .. Very good to watch .. Great score of the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> Wonderful piece of Western persona ..! 8 out of 10.
