Finally was released a good film Modesty Blaise, which not only tells a story, but tells the story "real." I admit it's a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop at your lane and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell how Modesty has become the magnificent person she is. Not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget the horrible movie of 66, then this is a magnificent movie. So you're a fan, sit back and relax and enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell your story.
