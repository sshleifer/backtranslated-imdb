In all truth, this really is not a "movie", but rather an extended final episode; By that I mean that if you did not follow the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street) I suspect you would have trouble following this movie made for tv. That said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think that says a lot about a television production that ALL cast members would return, many after years of absence, to once again portray their characters and wind up an incredible show. The film brings that sense of "family", not just between the characters, but also between the actors. It's all very bitter knowing that this will be the last time we'll see them together again under the title HOMICIDE. In terms of history, I found this film a bit flawed. Giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly artificial, and I felt that his shooting could have been handled within the parameters of his regular position, such as that of Lieutenant. In addition, Det. The extreme plot of Bayliss, which hung at the end of the series, is finally solved, but I, for example, NEVER felt it needed to be; I liked being left with a mystery (let's remember that the first case of the first episode was also unsolved for the whole series!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this movie, and the fact that it was still made after the H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who had no exposure to the series. Now, if they just released on DVD ...
