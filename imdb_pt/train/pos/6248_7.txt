Being an Austrian myself, that was a direct hit on my face. Luckily I do not live far from the place where this film happens, but unfortunately it portrays everything the rest of Austria hates about Viennans (or people close to that region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the directors: let your head sink into your hands and say "Oh my God, how can this be possible!". No, not with me, the (in my opinion) totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I watch porn for sure, but in this context I was a bit angry that put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story about how deceived people suffering from a lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and tedious horizons. A girl who is treated as a prostitute by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still keeps coming back), a teacher who discovers her masochism, putting the life of her super-cruel "lover" on the line, an old couple who has a cycle almost daily mathematician (she is the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a couple who has just divorced and has the ex-husband suffering with the acts of his ex-wife obviously having a relationship with his masseuse and finally a Crazy. who asks his drivers the most unusual questions and strives to be super-annoying. <br /> <br /> After you've seen it, you feel almost nothing. You're not even shocked, sad, depressed or in the mood to do anything ... Maybe that's why I gave you 7 points, it made me react in a way that I've never reacted to before. If this is good or bad, it's up to you!
