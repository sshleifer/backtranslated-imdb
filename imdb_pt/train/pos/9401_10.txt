What a wonderful film, eligible for so many labels it never gets: science fiction, film-noir, with a script and high-intelligence dialogue that assumes an educated and educated audience ..... the kind of English film that is only made in Pre-1960 England (and shown only in US theaters when it arrived), and never, never, in the USA. The main characters of The Man In The White Suit (1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, scientific reference words as "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry as " long-chain molecules "and then communicate the importance of these to the common man and the benefits that science provides. The Man in White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosion films that now (2009) dominate the world cinema, and certainly dominate the great cinema of the USA ....... it is a careful performance , cleverly told a story delivered by talented and credible educated English actors (who are educated and talented people), and everything is done with comedy, charm, pathetic, and a sense of irony that the ancient Greek playwrights would have endorsed. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch this movie, and someday, somehow some decent filmmaker and his supporters should make another like him. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
