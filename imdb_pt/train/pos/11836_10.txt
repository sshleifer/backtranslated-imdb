This animated film is a work of art! The narration, music, animation and plot where everything is remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw this again for the second time and got more insights. We invited some friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it. When I asked them to come, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who is very smiling at Dances With Wolves. The spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be both empowering and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time and I want to see it again. I really enjoyed "Spirit" because his portrayal of American Indians is realistic, dignified and non-stereotyped, unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado," which was a total sham because it portrayed the American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotyped manner. But Dreamworks redeemed itself by making Spirit a great movie that I found acceptable! I hope they continue to make animated films like Spirit, and I would like to see sequences or spinoffs for Spirit if they are done respectfully and without stereotyping Native Americans. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to other people who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: Cimarron Stallion.
