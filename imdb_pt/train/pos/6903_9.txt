This little appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch over and over. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! Gomez Addams, humorous and menacing, with the right tone for this irreverent parody of this story so told. <br /> <br /> Generally no interpreters and scorned, Moon Over Parador allows you to check out. reality and join in the fun happening on the screen. Two thumbs up!
