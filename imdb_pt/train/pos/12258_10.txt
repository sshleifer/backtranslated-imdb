Jane Austen's Emma is an extremely nice story in the worst of times and this production of the story is the best I have ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is beyond reproach. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) is able to bring the comedy effectively, she does not make Emma sympathetic. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for the play (and I believe the era) and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what Mr. Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is a splendid Mr. Knightly with the right mix of handsome appearance, proper age, chivalry, compassion, and chivalrous behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite pleasant.
