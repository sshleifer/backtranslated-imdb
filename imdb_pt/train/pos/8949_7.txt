Vertigo co-starred Stewart (in his last turn as a romantic leader) and Novak elevate this, another Stewart movie "Christmas movie", to above-average entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars contributes to a rather exciting experience and more revelations can be gained from the film if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for private pain that hinders many people's relationships. All in all, a good diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
