For a movie that had little publicity, and few people heard it, that was pretty good. It's another of those modern British police movies that are quirky ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It is not wild as "Snatch", but it is interesting and has some harsh characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a tacky and somewhat predictable ending, but at the beginning of the show - not late - has some twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it is a discreet British man who sends a Russian "bride to mail" that ends with the help of two Russian male friends, providing great surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Russian cohorts of Kidman. This is a different kind of film and well represented. Kidman once again proves that she is much more than just a handsome face.
