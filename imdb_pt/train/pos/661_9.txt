Ho, ho, homicidal maniac! This spectacular adaptation of a great tale of terror from EC Comics is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable series ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis takes full advantage of a witty script by Fred ("The Night of the Crawlers", "The Squadron of Monsters") Dekker who focuses on a ruthless housewife by Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode, which kills her idiot husband (a great guest of Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve, hitting him in the head with a gunshot. and crazy killer dressed up as gay Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit.The haunting and scary track of Alan Silvestri and the typically polished cinematography of Dean Cundey further enhance the macabre fun.And Larry Drake the gentle sweet giant Benny in "LA Law"!), With his frightening laughter, a demented glow in his bright green eyes and a malicious and wicked smile, makes a sensational and sanguine River Saint Nick.
