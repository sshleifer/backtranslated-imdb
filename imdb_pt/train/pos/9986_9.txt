As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought of adding my comments. Seeing the film without knowing the story beforehand harmed the film. The characters have so many complexities, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brightness of adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions about the lives of the characters, rather than being fed with an opinion. You can love them or not, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I strongly recommend.
