I liked Antz, but I loved "Insect Life". The animation that was put into it was worth it. I'll definitely be getting it on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I've heard of squishing all the characters to the screen in the standard video format). Most will have to agree that final credits are the funniest! I only saw one of two sets, but I can not see the other one!
