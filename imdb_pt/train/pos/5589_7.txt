Filled with symbolism and full of wonderful cinematography, Extase is much more than the erotic drama we all hope for. This is almost a silent movie, with the dialogue that exists in German, and highly simplified in German. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted the film to reach the widest possible European audience, since anyone with even a little of Deutsch's high school can easily dismiss the subtitles. The story is of little importance, however, with the success of the film on a cinematic level, not a narrative. Fertility symbols and the power of nature overwhelm human characters - there are even scenes in which flowers obscure the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has some message to convey, I think it is political: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; the working-class man is a happy and productive creature; and the woman is the creator, destined not to be satisfied until she has a child. This mix of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma does not subjugate the film at all - it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end - but it puts you in a very different artistic age. And, oh yes, Hedy takes her kit.
