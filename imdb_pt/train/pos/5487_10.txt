You've never seen anything like it. Once the bang begins, it's the most dazzling thriller you've ever seen - even knowing the outcome. And it's all real, because it's a documentary - incredible. <br /> <br /> When it was over, it was on the top 10 list of all time. <br /> <br /> Disregard right-wing zealots. Everyone I know who watched this movie give it a 4 star rating. Even if you do not care about Venezuelan politics or politics, you'll feel nervous and - believe me - on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> It's a roller coaster.
