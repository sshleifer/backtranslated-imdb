I'll start by saying that this has been unduly affected by almost everyone! The fact is, it was not what anyone expected, especially Guy Ritchie. What everyone was expecting was a cockney guy and a good liner "do you like idiots?" etc, but this is much more mature than their previous work. I agree it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to see them and hear more, this movie demands your full attention! Look beyond the cool and dazzling look of the movie, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and I think we will all have a more complete understanding of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this has its influences from the modern classics (fighting club, pulp fiction etc), but it is all around the original in both directions and rhythm with an unparalleled music score. I feel that if everyone watched this movie several times, they would understand a lot more and maybe appreciate the great modern movie theater that it is, and I also hope that Ritchie stays in vain, since I prefer that to his mockney. "masterpieces".
