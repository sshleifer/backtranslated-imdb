I was not going to watch this show. But I'm glad I did it. Critics of this simply do not understand! It's one of the funniest and funniest things on TV right now! However, when interviews were done with ordinary people, they probably seemed to be useless; but, put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and it's a riot of laughter. I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes. The pig with the suckling babies and their mother is invaluable. The husband and wife birds talking about health problems, and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was completely constipated broke me! Creature Comfort is the most imaginative show I've seen in a while! I hope you're back next summer when this race is over.
