This movie is very underrated. It is highly imaginative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun and in my opinion this movie is the first. But the film was forgotten when it first came out, and became even more oblivious as the years went by. Bill and Ted's "Bogus Journey," was also bombed at the box office, while the first was a hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie has just been released a couple of years late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already looked "like 1980s." Although the 1980s were a few years ago, the landscape of music and style for kids changed radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with their music Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses, along with their 80s style, seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91, and I think that's one of the big reasons the movie bombarded the box office . No one, other than surfers, still said things like "great!" it's fake!" in 1991. "Gremlins 2," which also came out in the early 1990s, suffered a similar fate from being a good movie that bombarded the box office because it was closely associated with the 1980s. The transition from the 1980s to the 1990s was much faster change than now with the 1990s and 2000s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, while now, 2002 and last year 2001 still seems / looked like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only "Excellent Adventure," which was made in 1988, was released that year instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was made quickly and released in 1989, so it would probably have been as wildly received as the first.
