The American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to catch the plane to the United States. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met for the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him for a tour of Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded. In the beginning, they were cautious. The funniest scene was listening to the CD at the music store. They peered at each other, though their eyes did not come in contact. After an in-depth conversation, the relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene they pretended to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it does not come as you wanted. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love. <br /> <br /> Excellent script and performance have resulted in tremendous success of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best romance movies. 9/10
