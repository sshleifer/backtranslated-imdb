I walked in hoping I did not like it; I imagined it would be terribly dignified and sincere, and somewhat laborious and monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's really much better than that, and I caught myself really enjoying it. I do not know much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she mourned him forever. Seeing the circumstances in which she grew up was fascinating; in fact, I saw myself wishing I had seen more of the story, and I imagine we might see a sequel at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is impressive. The sets and costumes are incredibly luxurious without being overly flashy and exaggerated. The acting is first class of all involved. <br /> <br /> In a word, it was great!
