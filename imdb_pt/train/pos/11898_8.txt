This film is a perfect portrait of The Nutcracker; the dancing is wonderful, the scenery in the background was excellent, and I LOVED THE FLOATING BED. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I particularly loved Marzipan's, the tutu was lovely. The special effects were very well done (eg tree, bed, etc.), and I really enjoyed the mice. I love how they do not make them scary, but cute and huggable. Except for the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you are a completely male person, you will not like this, but this is a very good movie for all ages - but not all testosterone levels. <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First of all, why did they have to put Sugar Plum Fairy's partner in those terrible pants? It would hardly make a difference if he were naked! And secondly ... because at EARTH they had to make Culkin's clothes, PINK?
