This is the first must see the movie I saw last year! It's incredibly funny, incredibly original, incredibly handsome (they've opted for that super cool widescreen Technicolor look that's amazing to see), and it really has depth of character and what it says about society. It's really a clever satire that unites everything from Homeland Security to racial issues, while at the same time making you laugh and realizing how much the world lives in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comedic performance that I never imagined would come from her! She is sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido who can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as the father is invaluable. In fact, the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the sexy and sexy zombie girlfriend (starting the idea now?) Funny, but it provokes and it's wonderful! Go and see this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
