Okay, at first it sounded like "Shrek" - the loner who is persistently followed by comic relief. Then evolves into something really attractive, as the challenge is set. And the result is a nice film, which has moments that I agree are a bit too dramatic for the children to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has obviously been worked on for a long time, so they can succeed in making a film set with almost no different set (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's good to know that they can do something emotional from that. As I said, it may be sudden at times, so children, be warned. The real disappointment is the animation. This was not as shaken as the toy story or shrek movies, and it shows. Humans are unrealistic and we've seen better examples of CGI. But do not let it tarnish the record: as a solo endeavor, "Ice Age" is laudable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Ah, yes, the moments with that little mouse are invaluable and show theft.
