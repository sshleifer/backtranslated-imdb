Splendid movie that in just eight minutes exhibits an unusual genre blend: mystery, suspense, musical. Briefly, we are allowed to tell about the story: a girl enters a European cafeteria and then ... the smooth transition from absurd mystery to narrative logic. At no time, Vigalondo got a B & B delight through imagination and despite (thanks to) the tightest budgets. <br /> <br /> Because of the unity of time-space, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, land of fast poetry in B / W (¿Remember the beginning Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> One must see to reassure our belief in the young cinema outside the States.
