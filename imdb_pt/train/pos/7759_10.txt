On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a brilliant and ominous novel about the sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But underneath all this is a deep social commentary on the life of 1950. Director Douglas Sirk scores again with another Univeral sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, also loves her. When Stack discovers that he is barren and Bacall ends up pregnant, the fireworks fly. And the very good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrayal of Texas' biggest nudge, which is rejected by Hudson. Good epic novel.
