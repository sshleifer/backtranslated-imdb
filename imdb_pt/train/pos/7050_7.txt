I do not want to spend much time here rambling about the plot - you've seen the trailer, and if you're not online. I do not recommend watching it though - it was poorly crafted and did not pack any of the movie's laughter or magic. So those who avoid this movie due to their lousy trailer should give this a chance. It's really funny. I was impressed by the cleverness and originality of this film. The first 40 minutes knocked me to the ground in hysteria - my only problem was that it evolved unnecessarily into a bad Austin Powers movie in the 20 finalists. This, however, is one of the few films in which the ending did not make me dislike it. the rest of the movie (which is usually the case). Everyone does a great job (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments everywhere. I personally plan to see him again when he leaves, just to get all the details I was laughing during the first show!
