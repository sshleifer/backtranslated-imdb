CINDERELLA, of Walt Disney, has a story that everyone knows and embellishes with humor and suspense while maintaining the essential charm of the tale. Disney artists provide the film with a compelling visual fairy tale that emanates a delightful fairytale atmosphere. It is beautifully, if conventionally, lively; the highlight is the captivating scene where the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a majestic carriage and Cinderella's rags into a beautiful dress. Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston offer such enchanting songs as "A dream is a wish that your heart makes" and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" that enhance both the setting and the characters. <br /> <br /> Although Cinderella's story is predictable, it provides such an exhilarating melodrama that it shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends. Both the evil stepmother and her terrible cat Lucifer present a formidable threat that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and rats. It is this threat that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the interest of the viewers. The suspense of the film, however, is well balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers. It is in these segments that they reveal the compelling personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving viewers to take care of them. Overall, the CINDERELLA of Walt Disney is a wonderful family entertainment that has stayed remarkably well after half a century.
