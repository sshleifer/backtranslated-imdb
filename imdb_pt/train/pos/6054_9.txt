I saw a preview of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT as I had heard about it in some motorcycle magazines. Although I mostly went through the races, the attraction of seeing Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) proved enough to push me away from the beer and party. Finally! we did that! we Brits really made a great motorcycle movie (and no, it's not like Torque) this is up there with the best of British comedy. Mark my words, this is the best screenplay of Phil Daniels, and as far as Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend making his name felt. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here he gives a touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing cinematic reputation. This is a movie not only for us motorcyclists, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope you get the same brilliant response on the mainland when you came to the Isle of Man. I'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has, (beware of the shop), because that would spoil the fun, but I'd say, , enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in a while. I really think this could be a cult classic. Like they were saying in TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
