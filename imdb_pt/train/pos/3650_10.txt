Sometimes Lady of Luck smiles at me. I had originally made - and copied - a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized what I had done since I had been unable to get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently, I signed the digital cable, and while looking for the next movies, to my surprise there was a scheduled broadcast of the movie. This time though, I made a copy of it on DVD so there was no chance to repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> I finally got to watch it again after eight years, and it was as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a bit of a prelude to this story in which my first contact with "Pandora's Watch" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. It turns out that I tuned the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and from the first part, I was hooked. Every day, I looked forward to the next chapter being read. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book would be broadcast on TV as a movie, I decided to clear my schedule for that event. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, contrary to what another reviewer said. That in itself is a rare achievement for TV movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the cast. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could have fallen and burned without a suitable cast for this key role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame we have not seen him any more. In fact, all the cast members did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie - and with the book - was the interjection of the "terrorist plan" of putting together a private jet of air-to-air missiles and having its pilot stem and knocking down the plane hit. Basically, we're talking less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this, and personally, that's not realistic considering all the players involved. Also unrealistic was how little the plane was affected by having one first, then two of its engines uprooted. <br /> <br /> That meat aside, I liked the suspense of the building and found it very convincing how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as well as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it by all means.
