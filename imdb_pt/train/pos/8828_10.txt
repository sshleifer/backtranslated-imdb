I was so happy that I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that the shorts are hard to find, so when I saw this and saw he was nominated for the short film Live Action at the Academy Awards, I was so pleased that I actually had a movie I was in. The plot is quite simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo have tried to create a reason for people to suddenly erupt into a number of music and dance as they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely fun and the music is really captivating. <br /> <br /> It's a well done short, well edited and all the actors do a great job. And the last scene in the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
