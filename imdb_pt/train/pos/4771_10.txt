The zenith of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, best known for less accessible material, creates a delicate and refined story around the most unlikely premise. A man travels to see his brother apart. Having no other means of transportation, your journey takes more than six weeks on a lawnmower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, offers an incredibly stratified and differentiated performance in the lead role. Beautifully beautiful in her exultation of little things, Straight Story is a classic movie experience that should not be missed. Sissy Spacek is remarkable as the daughter of Farnsworth, a weakened middle-aged woman who lives with the loss of her children.
