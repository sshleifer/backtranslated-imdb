BORN TO BOOGIE is a true 'find' - despite being a rock fan for almost thirty years, I only saw the movie for the first time a few days ago and rated it among the best rock movies of all time; the song is fantastic (the cream of T. Rex) and the consistently exciting and unusual visuals, leaving this viewer craving more previous efforts of direction of Ringo Starr, who did a good job here. If you love music, you'll be in T. Rextasy everywhere, as Marc Bolan really is the star of the play, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter a bit: different venues, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are used to lend different textures and much humor to what might have ended up as 'just' a concert movie in others hands. As rich and full as BORN TO BOOGIE, the film is only about an hour long, but what's there is totally satisfying. There lies my only criticism - the video package says something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims the movie has 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of fun.
