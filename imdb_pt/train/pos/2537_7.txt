Boris and Bela get along well in this movie, be they against each other, or paddling in the same boat. I saw this one in 1972, and I just bought it from Borders this year. This time, observing with my children, I took note of two things: it caught the attention of a child of 3, 4 and 5 years; and I picked up some things I did not have when I first saw it. Very fast story with an unpredictable ending. A must for movie fans !!!
