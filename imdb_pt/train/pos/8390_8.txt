My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Cinema and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats, the public had to wait for the filming to be changed) were a perfect match. There were a lot of clich√©s used in the movie, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really funny. The sound was also brilliant (sometimes coming back to be louder than the dialogue). <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved the way the post-war time was introduced. Great fun! <br /> <br />
