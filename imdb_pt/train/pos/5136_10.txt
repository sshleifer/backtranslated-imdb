Maybe the biggest movie about jazz. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot continues to haunt my reverie. Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> Jo Jones is always a delight (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the song; is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewelry. <br /> <br /> What shadows and lights - what music - what a hat!
