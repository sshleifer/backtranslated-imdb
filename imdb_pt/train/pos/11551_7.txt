THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "Odd Couple". His incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid 70s was a high water mark for television at the time ... easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale. However, how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau pairing? Matthau is in good shape especially as Oscar, the goofy. Lemmon takes a while to get accustomed to Felix, particularly if you've seen Tony Randall's excellent performance. The script is good ... definitely the best of Neil Simon. (I'll state here that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst and most criticized playwrights in American theater.) The plot is simple: Felix, a weirdo and just separated from his wife, moves to Oscar, the goofy man who needs help save money for alimony payments. Your life arrangement becomes much like a marriage, culminating in some funny discussions and arguments. Lots of fun and some great one-liners.
