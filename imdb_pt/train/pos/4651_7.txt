I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which made me pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit strange at times, but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility. The action scenes are quite enjoyable and the accompanying music is used to induce a bit of patriotic sentiment common to American films. This may not be the best movie of all time, but it's unusual for Sweden and I expect to see more similar ones in the future.
