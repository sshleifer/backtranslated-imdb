I look forward to seeing this from the first time I saw him listed in his work. I finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on the Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments about being a "funny story of 2 people crossing paths" were dead. Writers probably should not receive a bonus, all other SROs for making the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who enjoys a romantic movie MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> The presence on Natasha's screen is so warm and her smile so electrifying, let alone her beauty, that anything she's on is my favorite list. Your TV and print interviews that I've seen are so refreshing and worth looking for. <br /> <br /> God bless her, her family and future endeavors. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be available on DVD or video yet but I would be the first to buy it and I think the others too.
