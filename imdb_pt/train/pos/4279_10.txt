Years ago I was fortunate to have seen this gem at a gypsy movie festival in Santa Monica. You know the ending will not be rosie and the tragedy will strike, but it's really about the journey and the characters and their dynamics and how they fit into what was "Yugoslavia". Although I am not Yugonostalgic and tend to flee from the current crop of "Yugoslav" films (give me Ademir> Kenovic in the late 90's of Kustarica) I would be happy to have a chance to stumble in this movie again, shines in my memories of celluloid. Since I've seen who's singing there "I've been listening to the theme song for 15 years, sung by the gypsies, ruminating in my head" I'm unhappy, I was born this way ?? with the accompanying Jewish harp and accordion making the music fun and sad. The late and great actor Pavle Vujisic (Muzamer of When Father> Away on Business) was memorable as the bus driver of the ill-fated trip in his typical rude and lovable way.
