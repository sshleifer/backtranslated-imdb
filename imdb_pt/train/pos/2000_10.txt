I participated in a small mini-production of this when I was 8 at school and my mother bought the video for me. I have loved it ever since !! When I was younger, it was the spectacular music and dance sequences I liked, but since I watched it when I got older, I appreciate more the fantastic interpretation of actors and characters. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Nancy, by Shani Wallis, is the best character for me. She bore so much to those boys, I think she's such a strong character and her last scene when ... Well, you know ... It always makes me cry! Best musical in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time, will continue for many more years! 11/10 !!
