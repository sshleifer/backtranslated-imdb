Sometimes you have to look back to move on. The 60s did just that. We need to remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Great mix Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be nominated and win, the best mixer of the year 60. <br /> <br /> Best miniseries of all time. <br /> <br /> Thank you Ursula <br /> <br />
