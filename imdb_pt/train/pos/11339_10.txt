Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with the protagonist of this indie film, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. Does Jake (a hypnotist Anthony DeMarco) simply "transfer" the trauma of two bullying parents into an understandable image? Or could the creature be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan neatly balances the two possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. His choice to use a setting - a suburban home - heightens the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are highly convincing as angry but loving parents. However, they are the scary side characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), an unbalanced nanny and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a despicable real estate agent who stays in the mind. Jake's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special type of Hell.
