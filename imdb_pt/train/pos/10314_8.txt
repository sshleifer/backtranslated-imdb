This and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, there is something missing in this new series. Perhaps they will emphasize the lesson that needs to be learned. It's a bit duller and more sentimental than the Serling version. However, this episode can be considered quite sentimental as well. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never come together. I remember I was not surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later redone in "The Lake House.") I think it's because I saw this episode first, so that ruined the impact of the later film.
