Night is a fun movie with enough depth. All actors and actresses turn into spectacular spectacles. With the tremendous cast, however, is expected a stellar performance, but in this film expectations are overcome. You can relate to personalities and situations in your own family. When you observe the interaction of family members, the familiar memories of a person are immediately brought to mind. This is one of the few movies that inspires the person to read the book. Usually the opposite; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The scenery of Rhode Island is spectacular, as is the soundtrack. Any car chandelier will appreciate the seemingly expertly restored period automobiles. Needless to say now, but I highly recommend Evening. See that you will have fun.
