Ever since I heard about Ralph Bakshi's version of "Lord of the Rings," I asked myself, "What the hell is rotoscope animation?" !!! Well ... I finally figured it out ... I saw this movie about three years ago with no idea who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked it ... very ... Very good story ... this even has one small character development that's great for a cartoon ... See if you get bored with contemporary animation ... Do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a good cartoon ... It's a good movie too ...
