If you like movie, do not miss this one. If you prefer action, horror or romance, then you wonder what's going on. Everyone here is stuck in a gangster movie. And what happens is transcendental murder. <br /> <br /> There are few similar movies. No doubt you will see a limited release and it will be hard to find. But the research will be worth it. If you want to study a milhau as a potential symbol then this is really a movie to study. <br /> <br /> You can not watch it once. If you do, you'll never see what's happening. Dark City is better. Joe Vrs. The volcano is more fun. But Mad Dog Time could turn the gangsta crowd into symbolism. . . or at least think twice before filming again.
