It took me a while to watch this version, unfortunately I do not seem to be able to rent it in the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always on edge with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, as they are not British, naturally have to put the accent, and well to me it does not seem natural. Seems placed. Sorry, but do not think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I could not get used to any of the characters, but this version is more heart-pounding and more like the kind of person I imagined Emma would be. It's definitely the version I'm going to go back from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley was not prettier, but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax more (played by Olivia Williams). I've never really hooked up with her in the movie version, but she's best portrayed in this version. Come to think of it, (besides Mr. Knightley) all the characters are better played, let alone over. Unfortunately, both appeared at the same time and the Paltrow version gained more publicity. Pity ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! So if you are Jane Austen's fan, be sure to watch this one.
