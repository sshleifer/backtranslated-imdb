First of all I am a direct white male. But even with this downside I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And, of course, New York City in the 1980s. I had a lot of gay friends growing up in New York in the 1980s, and the only thing about them that I ever admired was their courage to live their lives the way they would like to live them. No matter what the consequences. This is brave. You have to admire this. This is a great movie, watch and see what it was like to be an extravagant Afro-American or gay Hispanic in New York from the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line is real life.
