Good Times was an innovative comedy about the first black nuclear family living on Chicago projects. Whether you live in inner cities, ghettos, suburbs, or the rural countryside, this show is still a treasure trove to watch and observe a family being just a family, rather than a program about a poor black family. But they do not insist on it. They find humor and have strong family and moral values. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping in the air, except that I did not like them killing their father, which I agreed with Esther Rolle, who fought hard to keep the family together. But despite all the behind-the-scenes fights, Good Times was a show about a family. We all love JJ's dynamite and his antics. We watched Janny Jackson's Penny grow up a bit. This show was groundbreaking to show desperation in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Not to preach, the Evans always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
