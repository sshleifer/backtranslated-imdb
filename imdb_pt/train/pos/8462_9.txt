I recently bought a collection of this incredible series and even after watching three episodes, I'm still mesmerized by the sleek style of animation and the slow but thoughtful actions of the narrative. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pains. <br /> <br /> Although this part of the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - an elegant satirical way of telling about wartime mistakes and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything (sounds familiar?), I have to say that this one becomes a little too gentle to continue explaining the lives of the main characters and their incessant need. the tummy ache over every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character named Wufei ... I mean, he grunts more than an American character in a novel. counselor, yes? <br /> <br /> In addition to the exaggerated drama (I think it comes mainly from the dubbing of the English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once more.I mean, it can always be worse . Could be like the recent issue, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic ... I'll talk about this later.
