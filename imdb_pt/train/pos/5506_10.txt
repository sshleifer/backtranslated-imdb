I can not quite understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate the two "sides" of the story, but certainly a film in favor of Ch√°vez against the propaganda tides against him should be seen as an attempt to balance the narrative in general (especially given the history of A. CIA involvement in Latin America in the ferment of civil unrest - the Google National Security Archive and B. coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly false scenes of Chavez supporters firing at non-existent opponents). What is most surprising about this film is the fact that the filmmakers stayed in the presidential palace all the way though the coup - certainly the first to make documentary - pictures of a coup on both sides !!!
