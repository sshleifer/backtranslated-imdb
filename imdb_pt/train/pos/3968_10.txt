I saw this movie for the first time as a boy and recently bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a dedicated and dedicated FBI agent. Her life at the Agency is interspersed with her family life, which is not all pink. His wife (an excellent portrait of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they even separate for a time; Chip's best friend and companion, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a shoot-out; Chip's son Mike joins the Navy during World War II. For all this, the family continues with bravery and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And Max Steiner's song says it all; fidelity, bravery and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI, and also to J. Edgar Hoover. If Hoover's type of surveillance had been observed, we could have been spared from September 11, the increase in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we have had to endure since his death.
