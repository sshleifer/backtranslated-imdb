McConaughey in a horror / suspense? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is counted in flashback mode, and concerns a normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre situation. I can not say much more without ruining the whole movie, sorry. Just be aware that if you decide to watch it, you will, at the very least, be surprised. <br /> <br /> All major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job driving these kids, and his acting is incredible. McConaughey's performance is solid and fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Is Dad crazy? Is there a God? Are there demons? How far would you go to fix a mistake? And what is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. <br /> <br /> And so I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second, or even third viewing.
