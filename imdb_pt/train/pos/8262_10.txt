Valliant's effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle for pronouncing this war director's dislike. The public not only learns a great deal about the early mining rescue procedures, but we learned that Europeans in the interval between World War I and World War II had pacifists about it (for lack of a better term). The speeches uttered by both representatives of each country at the end of the film are inspirational given the time. Although the revised edition, through the technology of transferring ancient foreign films, "heads of cut characters" sometimes, this film holds its own in many different aspects. Character analysis, lighting techniques, historical content and a setting that tested and inspired many writers and filmmakers. Pabst continued to direct and put on screen "Three Penny Opera" by Weil & Brecht, starring original star, Lotte Lenya.
