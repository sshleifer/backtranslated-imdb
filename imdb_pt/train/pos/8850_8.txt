The legendary director Sidney Lumet presents us one of his finest films in his historical career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-list cast led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney, Lumet captured not only elements from ill-preserved crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories like Common people. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may be confused and disappointed with the construction of the plot that Lumet has come through. Instead of showing it in a linear fashion, he followed Tarantino's route and shows the central scene of an assault that went wrong from different points of view, all out of order. I personally found this very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what would happen next. The script is very strong, with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally excited to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style that he does not normally dive into. Lots of action and suspense to arrest the audience during the two hours of duration, this is a rare movie that does nothing. Do not disappoint for a moment.
