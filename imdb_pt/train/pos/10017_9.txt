I absolutely loved this movie! I do not relate to all the other reviews I read about it. I was COMPLETELY charmed every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story exciting, intense acting, and exact direction. I literally jumped every time the phone rang near the end of the movie. Even though there was nothing "scary" about the story itself, I was deeply at ease throughout the film - and for the rest of my night. <br /> <br /> I discovered that there were so many perfect choices made-the cast, the script, the bits of humor scattered in it. There were so many points where the movie could have gone to cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately ... and for the last number of years.
