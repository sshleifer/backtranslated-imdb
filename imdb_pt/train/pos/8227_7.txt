An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder. Paul Winfield was an underestimated actor who took away all his roles so easily, it was hard to say that the man was acting. Perhaps best known to younger viewers as the voice / narrator of "Confidential City," Winfield ends his career with a movie more or less; but as always, Winfield shines. A pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is well, Erika Eliniak, good to see, but leaves much to be desired in the acting department. However, to be fair, this is one of your best efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: an assistive suspense that should not be missed by any fan of Paul Winfield. A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield to a celluloid paradise. What an actor He will miss.
