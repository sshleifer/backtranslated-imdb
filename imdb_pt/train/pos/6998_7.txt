Going to see Seven Pounds, I was not sure what to think because the previews left a lot to be desired to understand what the movie really was. So in the first 20 minutes, you're completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big jerk. All this comes to an end when the "twist", so to speak, is unveiled at the last minute of the film. Basically Tim (Blacksmith) was bothered and haunted by a major accident that caused causing the end of seven people's lives. With this, he decides to discover seven new people who desperately need help for whom he, in turn, gives his life. <br /> <br /> The acting of this movie is great, as I feel it will be good, no matter what. part he seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of her best films, plus the eagle eye that I think is up there. She's been a bit bad, but she does it in this movie. Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a role large enough to understand the character. Although the cast of the movie was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace than I expected. The film, however, was still very good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything fits. Until then, it seems like a useless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
