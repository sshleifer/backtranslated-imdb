I never understood why the song of the MacDonald-Eddy Swan has always been so ruthless - not just by its detractors, but by virtually everyone. For me, "I married an angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the pair's most celebrated tours. The sets and costumes are as luxurious as those found in an MGM musical, the script is trusted by Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), the Rodgers and Hart. songs (though slightly altered by regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest from MacDonald-Eddy) receive celestial treatment from Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for "The Wizard of Oz"), and best of all is that "boyfriends" are great. in their contemporary clothes and seem to be amused by the bizarre process. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Valentine" to the uninitiated today and they may well find it difficult to stand still, but this eccentric and accelerated fantasy is bound to entertain.
