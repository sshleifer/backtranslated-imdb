This is not Bela Lagosi's best film, but it has a good old-fashioned approach to horror entertainment from the 1940s. Brides are falling dead on the altar like flies. I think I'd postpone the marriage until after the demon gets caught, but it's a horror movie, so I guess people ignore the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a crazy doctor who needs young female blood to keep her aged and unhealthy wife healthy and happy. He always escapes from the Keystone Cops hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would think to look for a corpse in a hearse?), And the brides continue to get zapped. <br /> <br /> No movie like this would make it complete without a Lois Lane-type reporter who wants to catch the criminal by herself. Good at solving the crime, bad at keeping your mouth shut at all the wrong times, guess who Lagosi chooses for the next intended victim. I love the "haunted house" piece, where Lois Lane is stranded by a storm as a guest in the sinister mansion of Lagosi. Hidden runners, a vampire-like wife, Igor's evil assistant, and so on. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> The pace well done keeps the movie moving, and the story is solved in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, it's worth watching.
