This one-minute film is arguably the first movie of all time. Other inventors had already filmed actions - such as the photographic movement of an Edison sneeze - but the Lumi√®re brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium. At the time, of course, their "cinematograph" must have baffled their colleagues, including their subjects. In this first case, the brothers record the employees leaving their factory, some of whom, understandably, struggle to hide their awareness from the camera. Lumieres tries to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bike, but 'La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere' almost does not match the naivety of his later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the selection of the brothers from a working class family ritual as a theme. Your choice is the initial evidence of your curiosity about all the people in the world, a quality that makes viewing your experiences immensely rewarding and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
