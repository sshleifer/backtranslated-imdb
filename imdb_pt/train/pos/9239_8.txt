As I said in my commentary on the first part: These two films are better than most science fiction fans confess. <br /> <br /> The setting in the second film is not as exciting as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the consequences, thousands of refugees flee into tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story warms up, taking the battle back to the Cylon planets. . Okay, there's a bit of Mad Max, because all they fight is fuel for their spacecraft to travel to find the Earth far, but it works for me. It's an exciting sci-fi entertainment with excellent actors and decent special effects (even if they tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would love a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on the edge. Instead, we got a second sequel with no known character that proved that the story had worked before, especially because the characters were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So thumbs down to the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two 1978 films.
