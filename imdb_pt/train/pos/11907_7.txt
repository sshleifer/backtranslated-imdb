Hitchcock was of the opinion that the public is not really interested in what puts the protagonists in danger - only that they are in danger, and they must escape. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when she clearly is not. Trevor Howard decides that his best course of action is to run for it. And so, the body of the movie has our charismatic couple dodging and leaving the trains, buses and buses - jumping on the rocks at the top of a waterfall - climbing through the roofs of the shipyards. <br /> <br /> All the best - but I could not get it out of my head that everything was unnecessary. They should have stood. In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
