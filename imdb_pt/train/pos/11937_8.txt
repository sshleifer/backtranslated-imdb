This was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield. It was on TV last night and I believe I had not seen the movie since my second year at school and now I'm in my fourth year of college. Although the film has many flaws, it is so touching that you can not help but sit and watch and have fun. It's also hilarious. Danny Glover's claim is so exaggerated that you can not help laughing out loud with him most of the time. It adds to the film and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. You really do feel for the characters in the movie even though development is not the best. A must see. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
