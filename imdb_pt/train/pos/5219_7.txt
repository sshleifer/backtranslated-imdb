Gere and Danes star as two Department of Public Safety workers accompanying released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his herd. Gere is a watcher obsessed by those who are leaving. He's training, newcomer Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his herd as very sick and disturbed puppies. He asks questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve the crimes. He continues to be warned by this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. During his last days of work, a girl disappears and Babbage is certain that it is one of his herds that is lost. He and Allison restrict a list and find out that some of the offenders have left the program. So he decides he needs to track the missing girl instead of helping the police. That part is a little distant. <br /> <br /> There are some sick and distorted things shown in this movie. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a group of sick people do disturbing things with each other. Besides, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what sick aberrations they are. However, I would not call this movie excessive because not much is shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> FIND VERDICT: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and cops chasing assassins, then you'll enjoy it.
