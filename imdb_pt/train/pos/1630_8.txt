I may well be one of the few who actually joined this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up the Acedemy was way ahead of its time. The humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine. I do not see why MAD is behind this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early 1980s to have a soundtrack accompanying the killer with punk and new wave bands that were emerging from Los Angeles at the time. I own the soundtrack and I play constantly until today. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies out there. I do not consider Porky as funny as Up The Academy, there are some good laughs throughout the movie, and the jokes fit into stereotypes or sex. Hey, no one said that would be the Maltese Falcon.
