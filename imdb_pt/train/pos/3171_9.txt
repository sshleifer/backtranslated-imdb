Cross-eyed is a very original and fun movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the genre of comedy and really reinvents it in a good way. This movie is clever, concise, and consistently fun and fun. As a writer / director, Jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and amiable. History is definitely something you've never seen before, which is good. It's unique and fun, and manages to work on visually fantastic elements as well as the lost slapstick genre to form a healthy comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
