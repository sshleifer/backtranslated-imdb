If you do not like this movie, be your dead, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, all who gave good performances. This movie proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler is becoming a very respected actor. It all started with his Big Daddy performance, so he did some bad movies, so he did a great performance on 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, then on Click, and now Reign Over Me. back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing to the family he has is a mother-in-law and a father-in-law. After his former college classmate (Cheadle) rushed for him, he seems to change his life. I will not say anymore because I do not want to ruin the film, but I highly recommend this film. One of the best films of 2007.
