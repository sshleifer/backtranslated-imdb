This is a great little movie. I say "small" because it does not have 100 firing guns or a dozen blasts, as in a John Woo movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three "bandits". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a thread than a washing machine - instead of everything going round and round, it seems that things get worse as the plot becomes heavier. Wonderful ending, very positive. I've never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be very different from the movie because I feel like I'm watching a Elmore Leonard movie.
