The simple fact of still thinking about the film a decade later is what really speaks a lot about the film. For me this substance the Grand Canyon as a movie that will touch you in one form or another. I truly believe that before the Crash movie there was the Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two films, in my opinion, is the time of its release. I will not discuss the best, but I will argue that they share the same message. I would love to hear those who have an opinion on this subject. I'll get you a comment you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also meet me there to post any other topics about movies we can share, because I have a true love for movies.
