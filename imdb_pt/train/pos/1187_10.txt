The Last Hunt is the forgotten classic of western Hollywood. The subject of buffalo slaughter genocide is present in other films, but never so wildly. Robert Taylor's counter-type role as the possessed buffalo and Indian killer is his best performance. <br /> <br /> In the fifties, your mother overthrew you and your friends in the Saterday matinee, usually featuring a Western or comedy. But it was wrong then and now let a young man watch psychological dramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to movies with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why did not Mom censure these movies? Because they featured "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climactic scene in The Last Hunt is as horrifying as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The mythology of the white buffalo, part of the texture of this film, was later stolen by other films. including The White Buffalo, starring Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laughter here is that Bronson used to play Indians. <br /> <br /> Today, a large herd of lingering bison resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In the winter, hunger forces the surplus animals to leave the park in Montana, where they are sometimes harvested by the Nez Perce Indians of Idaho under a US treaty that predates the Lincoln Presidency. Linclon signed the congressional act that authorized the continental railroad and began the slaughter of buffaloes.
