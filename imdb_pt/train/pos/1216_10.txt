As a kid, I preferred the first Care Bear movie, since it looked so dark. I always sat and watched the first one. When I got older, I learned to prefer this one. What I think is that this film is too dark for children, but as you get older you learn to value it, since you understand it more, it does not look as dark as it was when you were a child. <Br /> <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is much deeper. It may contradict the first movie, but you should skip the first movie to watch this. The puppies are very adorable, I rewind this scene from 'Flying My Colors'. I try to annoy everyone by singing. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! A great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love all the songs in this movie, I downloaded them all and that's all I'm hearing, I'm listening to 'Our beginning', also known as 'Recalling' at the moment. I've always preferred this soundtrack to the first one, although I totally love Carol Kings' song in the first 'Care-A-Lot' movie. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both films are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and saw about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent. It was really amazing. <br /> <br /> There's not much backup from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is about how the Care Bears came to be and to defeat the Demon, Dark Heart. The ending is surprising and once again hits any 'Pokemon Movie' with the Moral Problems of Affectionate Teddy Bears. This leaves an effect on you. Again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality.
