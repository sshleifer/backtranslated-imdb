Beautifully filmed thriller, well represented, well scripted. He had me on the edge of my seat. I really liked the lead actress and I thought the villain was very well done. There is not much to mess here in the form of a theme, but if you just step into your place, turn your brain off, watch the sophisticated camera work and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well used, and regular moviegoers will probably know more or less what to expect in about ten minutes. But that did not bother me, since I enjoyed watching it happen. In the old days, they might not have focused so strongly on just two characters, and there were some compelling moments when I expected them to let some other people have some lines. But these people were probably right in keeping the film so focused. The plot got me by the throat very early, and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. as I'm not sure, it makes a lot of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
