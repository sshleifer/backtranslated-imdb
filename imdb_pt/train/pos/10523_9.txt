Emma is a true novel. If you love soppy stuff, loaded with wit and craziness, you'll love this movie! It's true for romance, which is very important, with some added twists for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorites, but she does justice to a role that required everything she had to offer in swords. She shines in a role that I do not think any other actress could have done right justice. <br /> Jeremy Northam, as the hero. How shocked are you? I've never looked at him as openly handsome, but heck! What the right role can do for you! He looks as good as the sensible and majestic Mr K, who is literally looking at him in a new light. It does and excellent romantic lead. The charm and character he brings to his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. a good cast. A good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MORE IMPORTANT, buy the books. Raises the movie to heights that are extraordinary
