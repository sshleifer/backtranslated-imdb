This movie was awesome! I can not beat the songs. I think I'm a little too old for musicals, but this movie deserves some credit here, folks! My special favorite was Jack Wild. I, being a lover of a British actor, you can not restrain me from all those beautiful young faces. I never knew that when Jack was making that movie he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven-year-old boy. He is short, is what helps. Try posting your answers, fellow posters, so that I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think the look of the drone is very familiar. Any idea where he starred before? If so, post, I'd like to know.
