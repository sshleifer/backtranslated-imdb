The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals in the summer migration to winter pasture. The basic value of this film today is as a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we in the West know as the "crazy twenties." A more drastic contrast could not be imagined. The mighty river and the barefoot crosses of the mountains are brutally realistic, and the animals that disappear beneath the water actually die. To ensure that the public at the time believed the story happened, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version I saw had a fascinating Iranian music that could stand alone and be enjoyed without the film. Having said all this, the film is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good night of entertainment. The crew had just enough stock to take the photos they recorded and there is fancy camera work resulting from several reruns. Western intertitles detract from the experience, but are in fact a part of the record as they demonstrate how Hollywood attempted to turn the lives of an indigenous population so that it was appreciated by the audience of the day. Out-of-service entertainment by the desert police becomes a "police ball." Producers went on to make the documentary-drama Chang (1927) and the fully commercial King Kong (1933). The theme of migration is used again in People of the Wind (1976) and in the Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know beforehand what they are getting into - and then highly recommended to them.
