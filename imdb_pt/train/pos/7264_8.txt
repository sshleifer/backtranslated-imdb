I have to agree with Cal-37, it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and cute, of course Jim Belushi won his cops! But if I really liked it was piano music, if you are a musician or do not watch this movie just for that, you will know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You're nobody until someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So have fun watching <br /> <br /> you, <br /> <br /> Nelson
