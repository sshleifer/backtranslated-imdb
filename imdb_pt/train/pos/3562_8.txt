Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of New York's oldest floating craps game and needs $ 1,000 to secure a new location. Confident of his chances, he bets on the city's most famous actor, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can not conquer brave missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is a great musical because it cleverly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage. During a dazzling opening sequence, multitudes of pedestrians move in rhythm, stopping and starting as if they were responding to the backstage signals. Even the walking movements themselves are stylized and angled, midway between a walk and a dance. The city of Mankiewicz in New York is a shimmering wave of color and art deco movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the underground game business and criminal thug looks perfectly cool. <br /> <br /> As I write this review, I just got word that Jean Simmons passed away at age 80. This, incredibly, was the first time I saw her in a movie, but she was dazzled. I from the beginning. Her idealistic, sexually repressed Sarah comes out of her shell after an alcoholic binge in Havana, releasing a adorably playful version of "If I Were a Bell." Although Simmons and Brando are not singers, producer Sam Goldwyn has decided not to voice his vocals, claiming "maybe you do not sound so good, but at least it's you." Despite Goldwyn's indirect confidence, the pair does well to carry entire musical numbers. Simmons suggests the same infantile animation that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to the role, and Brando emanates so much self-confidence and charisma that it does not matter that his voice is not there.
