Dazzled by "Braveheart" released the same year, the two dramas call for comparison. I admit my prejudice against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy." Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" depict Scottish history in a bloody and romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic hymn to honor and individual courage and a beautiful fantasy of revenge. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and mushy. Note the use of cornball for slow motion shooting. His violence is ugly and glorious. It is the ultimate quality that makes her more attractive to the teenage mindset. While "Braveheart" beats "Rob Roy" at levels of carnage (not to mention its lenient execution time), the latest film is more mature and satisfying. His action is more discreet, but more surprising and intelligent. Her sex is less showy, even more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better perceived romantic interest. His dialogue attempts to bring poetry closer to the period. His rotten teeth in the mouths of the actors try to approach the dentistry of the time. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot". You may find the latter more like "Braveheart," with its emphasis on blood lust, with the first more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All of the above movies deserve their R ratings for violence.
