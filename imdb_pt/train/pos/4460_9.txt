Oh, a Kelly / Sinatra musical. So familiar, right? Yes, but that's not what you usually hear. On The Town is that. But if you stick around, you can learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three- or four-day leave. Joe is the "sea wolf" and Clarence, the type of authorship, begs Joe to give him a "lady." Now, after being caught by the cops, they take little Donald home. That's where they meet Susie, that seducer, that jezebel. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. He is right? Or is he an idiot? Or is he just mismanaged by society? Discover all this and more when you watch {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> Q. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but sickly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
