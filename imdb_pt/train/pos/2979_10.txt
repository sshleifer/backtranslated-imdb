There really is not much to say about this movie ... it's rude but fun. Two of Milwaukee's losers, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) invent a new game of (IMDB) basketball, using the rules of baseball. When the game becomes a huge success, they, along with the help of a billionaire, form the Professional Base League of Ball, where everyone receives the same payment and no team can change city. The Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only team that is on the road to the great rule changes that the Dallas Felons owner (Vaughn) wants to institute. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br / <br /> The acting is very good, since there are not many great stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a good job on their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie that I can not come close to naming them all. This never stops working, and they do not try to put some drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" from Reel Big Fish. Very understated. <br /> <br /> Overall, a rough movie, but extremely funny. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
