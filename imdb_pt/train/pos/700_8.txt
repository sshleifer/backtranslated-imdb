The Insomniac Nightmare was an incredibly interesting and well done film. I loved the way he simply plays you into the main character's subconscious without coercing the viewer ... the acting was top notch - honestly, I watched Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - but all the others, especially the young woman, were also great. I was very impressed with the look of the movie too. Usually, "independent films" have a grainy look, "I-shoot-it-on-my-camcorder," but this director knows what he's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I look forward to a long-term Tess Nanavati job!
