Jeremy Northam's characterization of Morgan Sullivan, an educated and gentle stutter, watching him drop pieces of his true identity under the influence of malt whiskeys and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. Offering him a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking, and he gets lost in his face, neck and lips. No matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. Nor can love be "brainwashed" with either of its two fake wives. In gradual steps, he begins to dispense with his glasses, walk and talk differently, and even his face looks different as the movie progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and drives from time to time. The extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes it almost a sci fi "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I wish I had seen more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's portrait whenever she sees him in her various worn out states, the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, some contained vulnerability, and flashes of genuine sympathy and worry would have made performance less one-dimensional on their part. It's no match for Northam's talents, but I really enjoyed this film and would like to hear about other scripts written by the same author.
