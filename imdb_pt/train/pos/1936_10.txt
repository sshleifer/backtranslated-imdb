this independent film was one of the best films of the high grass festival I've ever seen there, I loved it, there are so many things that was great about the movie, plus all that the cast and crew that I had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal. I thought Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely loyal to his role for a Disney actor. I was amazed at his talent for being able to go from tacky teenage comedy to such an adult role with no flaws. The talent in the movie was simply amazing the cinematography was great if you want to see an independent movie, this is one that you really should see. I think Mr. Gruver would have been very proud to have such a submission at his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the favorite audience that they went and saw it again. This was a really great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional was simply fabulous. I am honestly so enthusiastic about this movie and I really do not want to ruin this for anyone just watching and really be amazed at this I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to go places and hope to see more work from them in the future.
