I can admit that the script is not very good, and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have fun. First of all, the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria.) Michael Douglas proves that he still has it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, Play the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent to the pot. And secondly, this movie is the most fun I've had in years in Theodore: it's plain and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and have lots of fun to see, The Sentinel.
