Oh, come on, learn to have some fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was Oscar-worthy to me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now it's a little stupid, but come on. If you liked "Excellent Adventure", you should probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the movie before "Dude, where's my car?" Only this one is really funny. Like I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you liked the first one, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. For your enjoyment, watch, let go and remember that it's a silly comedy. That is all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
