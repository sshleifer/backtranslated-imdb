Not a movie at all, but this movie is in my top 10. I am a lover of black comedy humor. With a cast that includes Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London) on the tracks, the lines can not be dry. The support cast is almost dead center. Counting the small flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup gave the face a faded look; there were some unsung appearances by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor, and Michael J. Pollard's viewing time was too short. Above all, the cast was incredible without egos to destroy a good script. If you have ever seen Larry Bishop (writer, director), Underworld (a dark crime film), you will like this movie. His next move (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
