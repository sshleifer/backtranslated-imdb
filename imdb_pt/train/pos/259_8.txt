For a Danish film, I have to say that this is a very good film. <br /> <br /> It is in a class of its own but has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget, and is starring famous Danish actors, and some newcomers, who play very well. It can be seen by anyone who likes adventures and a little 'ghost' movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, be thrilled!
