OK. This has been a favorite since I was 14 years old. I do not watch it several times a year, but ... This is not a movie for an older generation that wants a deeper meaning or some brilliant message. This movie is fun. It's very outdated, almost outdated, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable. Whether you want to be charmed with a 90's breakfast at Tiffany's, watch the raves of the 90's or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
