Quite possibly one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see it I suggest you see "South Park" one of the funniest cartoons ever created. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. Pure blow of genius. If you do not think funny, you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
