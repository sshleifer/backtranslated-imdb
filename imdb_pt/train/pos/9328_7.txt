The Perfect Son is a story about two brothers in their 30s, one who is apparently "perfect" and the other who is basically crazy, often putting himself in drug rehab centers. After his father's death, the two are reunited after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces. It is not until the "perfect" brother makes the surprising revelation that he has AIDS that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order, and takes some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of telling the younger brother's "comeback," though it may seem a bit overdone at times (overcoming drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the film more tender is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has become somewhat outdated in filmmaking in the last 5 to 10 years. And also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two siblings previously fought is very believable and well done. The two main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A first solid effort by director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose brother died of AIDS. The end is well done too. <br /> <br />
