The silly movie is very funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it may be a bit too obvious, it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess, but it's funny all the way. And it's worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right-wing nut. This movie is of the same class as Elvira, Master of Darkness, another incredibly funny and underrated film.
