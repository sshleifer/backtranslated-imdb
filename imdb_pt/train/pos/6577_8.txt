With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays virtually disappeared from the theater these days. Too arched, too dizzy seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's funniest plays does not refute this verdict. It is certainly bow and talky, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British theater, it's perfectly shaped with actors who - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us probably never heard of. Carter is splendid as the Bulgarian girl who houses the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and then falls in love with him. One can argue with the particularly ludicrous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the onslaught of enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role invites over-acting and Ryecart was obviously told to over-act. The other players are perfect. Carter as the self-dramatizing Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as the Swiss soldier-of-fortune are in the center of the play, of course, and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" appears as a filmed piece. But you're unlikely to see a Shaw movie that does not bear its origin. The plots are usually clever. However, Shaw is all about the dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are immaterial. Enjoy this for what it is.
