The biggest film by Pressburger and Powell. David Niven plays the RAF bombing pilot who loses his own death but gets a second chance at life when the sky notices he is away and sends an angel to investigate. The scene in which young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all dead in action, arrive in heaven to be sued for eternal life is unbearably pungent. Beware also of Roger Livesey, a deeply underrated actor, and Kim Hunter as the love interest (later, of course, Zira on Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg cast the actress who played the lead angel (Kathleen Byron) as the elderly wife of the same-named Saving Private Ryan, half a century later, an act that speaks volumes about her film literacy.
