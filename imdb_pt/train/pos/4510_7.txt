Insisting that the inspiring spirit of Martin Luther King resides not only in American civil liberties but within the hearts and minds of people everywhere, the Danish Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a Danish high school in 1969. More specifically, he enters the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and grossly abusive director Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with some aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it engaging. A battle of ideologies between a thirteen-year-old man and a demented disciplinarian gives way to the inherent humor, but awkward changes in the misleading moods, while keeping cynically cynical in the same vein as a "Society of the Dead Poets" more than a "Matilda ". He follows a familiar path, but a continuous and precise service for his young protagonist, including a personal subplot that completes Frits when a boy becomes young, manages to transform the film in an exciting family film, with the nose in the money.
