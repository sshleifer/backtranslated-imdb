Nowadays, most people do not watch classic movies like that. Most friends watch only the movies from the 90s to the present. That's kind of mean. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Just because when these films were thought and done, the ideas were new. Now people strive only to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, for the movie. For the true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on an investigator of Scotland Yard investigating the disappearance of a movie actor, and is faced with three other strange occurrences with former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say anymore, because I'm going to ruin the movie more than I already have. But it's a fantastic movie no matter how old it is. And you would never mind watching it again!
