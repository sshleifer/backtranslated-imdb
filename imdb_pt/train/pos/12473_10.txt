A hot and moving film that has a quality of fantasy. <br /> Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many great performances but there is just something about this will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> Above all, you have to see this amazing 5 years. Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by her presence that I had to buy the movie so I could see it again and again. It is a miracle of God's creation. Judging from IMDB's high rating, I'm not the only one who got mesmerized by this young actress.
