The combination of superb black and white photography and the plot of 'Eugene Onegin with a twist' made it a real blow to me. The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with the very bright occasional overexposed white was exciting. There was a superb moment in which transparencies - seemingly conventional holidays, but where actors' faces revealed subtle but instantaneous character and situation - were shown accompanied by Lensky's aria from the opera Tschaikowsky Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me, the hallmark of a good movie is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that means, which means that often the story is less important than images and atmosphere - Last year at Marienbad is a good example of such a movie. Krisana is in the same mold.
