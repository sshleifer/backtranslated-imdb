I know you've done it at film festivals (or at least I think you do, I may just be making this up), but I think that should be the "best short animation" in each. Angry. I can not wait for the full movie. I realize that you may not hear this quite often because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but listen now and accept this as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I'm still serious. And here comes another still - And I can not stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and at the same time, I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all of your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have many of these. <br /> <br />
