"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These, and a lot of other high quality shows, prove that we are in the middle of a golden era in the history of television. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories, highlighted by sublime cinematography (incredible to use that word when describing a TV show), a killer track, great performances and editing. Anyone who is not connected to it is missing out on one of the most important creative expressions on television of all time. It may have its problems, by watching only one episode per week, but the DVD format is really an incredible way to watch it. I hope they stay that way (as I'm sure they do).
