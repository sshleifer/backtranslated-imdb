My favorite movie of "Imperialism" and one of the best action and adventure films of all time. Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring and wise cracks to please everyone but the "PC" of movie goers. Memorable scenes abound - the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys battling hundreds of bandits; MacChesney & Cutter giving Bobby Coote the punch with thorns ("save some for the elephant"); Cutter for MacChesney - "I'm an Expedition"; Rompei Cutter out of prison with a fork ("what do you think I'm trying to escape? A Bloody Pudding?!") And the incredible temple scene with Cutter singing and then announcing, bold as brass - "All right, all of you They are trapped! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice it to say that I try to get this movie whenever it is. <br /> <br /> For adventurers and generals, it's hard to imagine better 2 hours.
