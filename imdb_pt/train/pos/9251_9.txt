what can I say?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl, and as an Italian American, number one female fan of beauty, I can not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> you know that I really do not remember much of the plot, the situations or the other actors. I can only remember about the beautiful Erika and that in this movie she looks better than ever, I do not really care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the good times I had been a teenager in Brooklyn Just contemplating the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well, to conclude, if you are Erika Eleniak's beauty fan like me, definitely this movie is for you.
