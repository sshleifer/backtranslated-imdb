The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric made a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Far superior to "The Grifters," which was a good film, this film really remained true to the pulp fiction / film noir roots of where the story came from. I recommend this movie to all noir movie fans.
