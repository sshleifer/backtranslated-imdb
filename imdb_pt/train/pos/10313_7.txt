China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was directed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost the touch because he is not as good as director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Rothrock and Richard Norton. Whether this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been an action classic instead of a direct action movie for video. China O'Brien returns home to help his father. He's having trouble with the local gang and needs her help. Then she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they suffice to overthrow Mr. Big and his evil friends? <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock then this movie is for you. I just liked the fight scenes, everything else is crap. Why did Raymond Chow not spend a few shekels and hired a first-rate action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
