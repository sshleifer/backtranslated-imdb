I liked this show for two reasons. 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two artists took the show with the support of regular and recurring actors. Replacing the GDR in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is simply tremendous. You get the feeling that actors like to have fun after the camera stops scrolling. This relationship is transferred to the program we can see. <br /> <br /> The GDR gives character personality to his O'Neill character. He never knows when to give her a break. You watch the others roll their eyes, discouraged by some of their statements. Still, they know that he is the man he has around when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' beneath the surface. They manage to keep the cap, but often just barely. The episode 'Solitudes' in the first season had some of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together. "Carter" and "Jackson" often have to soften some of the turmoil created by O'Neill. However, O'Neill's tactical instincts always seem solid. He understands what to do without having to think about it. The team was repeatedly put at risk by others who were not listening to their orders. <br /> <br /> Quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The arc of the original story was largely exhausted and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to the GDR in the realization of the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances in those two seasons. You could see your appearance much altered after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but it's mostly a weaker effort. The main characters do not have the cast chemistry of the original. Wraiths are so improbable as to be ridiculous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe something on the show or it will not last beyond season four. <br /> <br /> There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have pyramid-shaped space ships is a design monstrosity rarely matched in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for lighting in these ships is as bad as. The exaggerated use of the decoration of ancient Egypt, concealing ultra-modern technology, is equally difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> I also wondered about some of the continuities of the program. At the opening of season two, 'Daniel Jackson' is shot and his uniform has a hole where he was injured. He crawls into a sarcophagus and heals his body and restores his uniform as if he had just stepped out of the closet into the wardrobe. The episode 'Hathor' has a sarcophagus falling into the hands of SCG, but is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes in 'Daniel', 'O'Neill' and 'Dr. Frasier '.
