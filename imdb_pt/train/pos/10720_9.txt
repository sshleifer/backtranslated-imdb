Alive! A space movie that does not take itself too seriously and everyone can come to the exciting ride that is space camp. The movie begins slowly, the usual mix of idiots and mixed flyers in dishonest soup. But when things get tough - the tough guys are solved and it's not an unbelievable change in the characters because you can believe there's some responsibility in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as the instructor "I'm right and you're wrong." I would recommend this as a good night out in the movie and a 7 Vote.
