This 370-minute film was shown on Italian public television during the early seventies. It tells him the myth attributed to Homer of Odysseus's journey after the Trojan War. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, counted in the 500-year list after these events, circa 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a 1969 film, so if you buy the DVD version you would think the sound is just mono and there is no language other than Italian until the legend is in Italian. Feather. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if they had the English subtitles on the list. But if that's not a problem for you, I strongly recommend watching this movie.
