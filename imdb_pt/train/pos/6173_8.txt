A great movie. The performance - from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute, with very few exceptions, was marvelous; I thought soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who may be accused of overacting, presented a rather believable and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the camera work - and the way it captured the energy of the streets of bombay, the tranquility of gustad saying their prayers and life inside the tiny apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall that becomes a sanctuary and then it is broken - and the philosophical artists assume that. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies about Indian subjects.
