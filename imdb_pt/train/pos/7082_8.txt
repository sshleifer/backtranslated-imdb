First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his movies, you'll see that the characters have those moments when they are the same. Your character in this movie is way beyond each other so far ... and counting. The story begins in the future (not so distant) where a man is sent into the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of mankind from the face of the earth. The story seems to go toward SF, but I think it's closer to a drama because of the slow pace of the story. About this. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more late than at first, but as you watch this movie, you will be aware of this steady pace of history and revealing facts that do not speed up or slow down. It's the same speed that flows smoothly and very well. But that does not mean that the ending will not make you nervous, because it's very good. As for the direction, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad direction, but this one has become much better. So whether you're getting ready to see a sci-fi movie or some action, you're going to miss it. B There must be more movies like this.
