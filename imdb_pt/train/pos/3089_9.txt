I got hooked on this, as apparently ABC licensed this program for Pearl TV in Hong Kong. This caught my surprise, as it was a break from hearing anything Chinese. But I started to get involved, since the cast and stories are just NYC enough and thoughtful. Nothing too unbelievable, although I find it very stereotypical to write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet !!!! That was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad to hear about IMDb that I can not wait to watch Season 2 when I return to the US. I am as disappointed as the other reviewers that this showed a lot of promise, quality and good taste. But as it shows the characters approaching, it's probably harder for people to watch if they start watching episodes. Which is apparently a bit too late for anxious networks.
