After seeing "Whipped" at a distributor's show at AFM the other night, I must say I was completely impressed. The audience was laughing all the time. Unfortunately, all territories have already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy the film, but I truly believe it will be a great success both domestically and abroad. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be released as "Sex and the City", mainly because unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire about dating that never gets too serious. "Whipped" mocks relationships in a way that most sexual comedies do not dare. In addition, the film I screened in the AFM had one more plot and story than "Swingers," "Clerks," and "Sex and the City" combined. "Whipped" never slowed down and provided the audience with an uninterrupted comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were all solid, which only made the film more impressive considering the budget.
