"The second beginning," as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. Defined long before the matrix exists, this short anime written by the Wachowski shows us the world that could be ahead of us in the not distant future, established at the turn of the 21st century, the second rebirth delves into common issues with human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second rebirth is no exception to this concept, however, instead of a simple man vs. man scheme. machine, this story explains the struggle that machines face, the struggle for acceptance in a world governed by human beings. Where matrix movies show us the human perspective, these little animations tell the two sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second part Renaissance 1 + 2, answers many questions raised by the original film Matrix, how the war broke out, how the sky was black, which led to the use of humans as batteries and also introduced us in the city of machines called 01, which may have relevance to the upcoming Matrix Revolutions movie. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal much of the story, as I do not want to ruin the experience for the viewers, however, I will recommend it to anyone interested in the world of the matrix or simply anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
