I can really say that I felt the film in its right essence, where the mental games of dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of the future faced by Tom Cruise. I did not care much about the acting prowess of Tom Cruise, but I must say that he seems to impress at all times in the film ... not simply because of an engaging storyline but also because it is being passed on to the character main. .. they merge and then they talk and it's beautiful. However, I must say that this film does not come under the "average weekend movie", which you choose randomly and watch merrily; It carries strong feelings and characters, so do not drop it with your beer and your corn kernels. Surely you need more than that.
