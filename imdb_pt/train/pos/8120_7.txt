Things to Come is an old science fiction movie that shows an imagined world, or "Everytown" for 100 years. You can divide it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film covers from 1940 to 2036 and it is mainly about how this ruler or the "Boss" wanted to have the ability to fly on airplanes again, after Everytown was bombed and war broke out. <br /> <br /> This movie only has about 3 flaws: the audio is muddy and the video has some quirks, the characters are not deep, and the overall plot is not totally solid. The plot is missing something that I can not put my finger on ... it just seems a little "cute". But if you like science fiction and are interested in what H.G. Wells could have happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. It is worth seeing just to know what everyone feared: a long war, because they were about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a very good movie that most people need to see once.
