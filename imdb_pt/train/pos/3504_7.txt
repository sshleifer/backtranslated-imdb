This movie looks like a movie project. As if the filmmakers chose a cross-section of society without experience and began to work. The characters are kind of not involved and naive. Despite this amateur sensation, the film is effective. It's like a cross section of life with neighborhood kids trying to perceive or nurture their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a grandfather, it is clear that from this generation there is shame associated with sexuality. This provides some predictable but well-done conflict. Probably the most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in their romantic relationship, realizing a deeper depth to the sexual feelings. A good watch, but nothing stirring ....
