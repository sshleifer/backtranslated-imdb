*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This movie, "The Divers", is really interesting. All I knew about it was that it involved Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everyone spoke Danish. But I decided to check for a reason, the fact that the story evolves around a German submarine sunk from WWII. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially debris that can be dipped. So I was a bit skeptical about the Danish part, but I reasoned that the sub-target could weigh that part. Knowing that the Nordic movies are not always so good and are not sure of the size of the budget, I was at the very least very skeptical. <br /> <br /> On seeing, I was ... surprised. <br /> <br /> I had some thoughts about the actors being inadequate, seeing as some are very young, the two main actors in particular. This was not a problem, both work very well. Like the other actors, they consist mostly of people in their 50s and beyond. This creates an interesting interaction between the young and the old, which is not often seen on the screen. It is not unique anyway, but a bit rare. And everything is fine. <br /> <br /> As for the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was no problem, had subtitles. Another issue was the submarine itself, I suspected there would be internal shots as well as underwater outer shots of the submarine. Having decided that their budget was scarce, I thought this could be the best and the worst at worst. Once again I was surprised, the outer scenes of the shipwreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German submarines, I knew what the submarine would be like, especially inside it, and was not disappointed. The team did some serious research. It's all right. <br /> <br /> I suspect more people than I will watch this movie just to see some scenes of sub-wreckage, so I feel I should give a "warning." The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. It's a special sub. But to give you a clue what to expect, it's a cross between a Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese transport submarine similar to I-52. It is a good project of God and makes a good accident. <br /> <br /> The setting is on an island or Danish peninsula, I can not remember. It is summer and two brothers travel to grandfather to celebrate the arrival of summer as they do every year. Your grandfather is a kind of sailor. The cinematography is quite nice, lots of beautiful summer scenes on the island docks, a bit of newly discovered adolescent love, good diving climate and an overall 'perfect' feel. Once again, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> In terms of scenery, the island receives some visitors of the suspect type, a group of men hire one of the boats, an old mineshaft and its crew. One of the visitors, a man of 50 years, has the German eagle and the swastika tattooed on the back. All the citizens of the island remember when a German submarine sank at the end of World War II and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold deep down. The grandfather was one of the young men who sought out the sunken submarine soon after German bodies began to float in 1945. No submarines were ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> <br /> Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunt, secrecy, competition, adolescent love, conspiracy and ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> I did not expect some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and caught me off guard. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, it fit the story well and does not pose any problem. It's not like "From sunset till dawn," where everyone turns into vampires in the end. That's a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Very good movie, I gave a 8. Some, due to the fact that it is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that I had a fair budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if this had been a Hollywood production, I'd give it a 7 or 8. Definitely worth it. Yes, the story of a child, in a way, but again a mature story. There is a lot of suspense and a great aura of adventure, which I found very attractive. And again, cinematography is really good. <br /> <br /> / Jellyfish 2001 <br /> <br />
