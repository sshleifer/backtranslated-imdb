I read somewhere (in a pretty panoramic review) that this is something like a live action anime mecha, and I think they're on the right track. I watched this movie for the first time when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally did it recently, all the memories came back. I do not think this should be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of the fun of almost-old 80's TV movie (it's set against the background of a rather dark future, although this point is not stressed too much ). What I admired most about this film was that the dialogue did not sound generic - no clich√©s, no predictable lines - all in all, just good fun! Maybe the weather has not been kind to this little movie, but still I can feel appreciation for it in me. It is not perfect, but it is fun and does not try to be anything other than that. Let the nerds and comic book guys worry about technical details - who cares? See for yourself and make your own decision. No one else is important.
