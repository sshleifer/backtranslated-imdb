The good thing about this movie is that it is alone - you do not need to have seen the original. Unfortunately this is also their biggest disadvantage. It would have been nice to have included some of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives developed. Sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the best comedic moments as he tries to deal with embarrassing and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth should be congratulated for a courageous attempt to move the character and create an original sequence, but the film is basically defective and lacks the heat of the original.
