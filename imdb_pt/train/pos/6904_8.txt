This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over. If you've never seen, take a chance. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the movie has so much fun, it reminds me of Julia's untimely death. It is a good opportunity to sit and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much for us in these times of terror and fear.
