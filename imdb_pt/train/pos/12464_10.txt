Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - what more could you ask for? Monkey Grip based on the award-winning novel of the same name explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother who falls in love with a heroine addict Jobe (Friels).) A simple story is really extraordinary through magnificent acting (in particular Noni Hazlehurst) and The Only Fail is (if you can catch it) is that the story is set in Melbourne, although for budgetary reasons, the film was filmed mainly in Sydney, so as a result, in some scenes you see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then , a Carlton post (Sydney scenes). In addition, "Monkey Grip" is a must see (sorry the click, but it is) at least for an award winning performance of the former "Play" School "and" Better Homes & Gardens "presenter Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> 10/10
