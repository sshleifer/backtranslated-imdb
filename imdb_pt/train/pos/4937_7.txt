This film is really pertinent to this day, given the threat of bioterrorism and the threats of superbugs, West Nile virus and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is pretty intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than helpful in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a good interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film that made the most of his mark is Jack Palance. Its well-defined features and seemingly relaxed exterior always open the way to reveal the greedy and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene through the packaging factory is impressive to this day. Recommended, 7/10.
