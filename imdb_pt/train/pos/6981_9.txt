For all those who hate it: Condemning a TV series with an episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. That being said, I was a big BSG fan, I thought it was one of the best TV dramas (not just science fiction) in the air. But it was time to end and the story move on. I liked BSG's epilogue "The Plan", but raised as many new questions as they answered, so I eagerly waited for "Caprica" ​​and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping he would not try to be another BSG, and I was glad that "Caprica" ​​is something different, and I personally found the story exciting, in a different way from blazing space battles, explosions and special effects of science fiction (do not get me wrong, I like these things too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales gave solid performances, and Alessandra was simply wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
