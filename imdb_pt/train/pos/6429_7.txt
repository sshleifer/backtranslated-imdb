If movies are to be believed, the Chinese ghosts are much cuter and more malicious than their western counterparts. The tangles of the three 'Chinese Ghost' films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the details and colors are such that it is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a lot of assaults. For those who have not yet found the 'Chinese GhostStory' trilogy, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre; for those who have, another nice joke in the Chinese ghost world.
