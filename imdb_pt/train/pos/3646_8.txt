"The Rookie" by Walt Disney, is based on the story of Jim Morris, who made one of the most incredible twists in the history of the sport, ending almost 10 years of retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35 . The film begins with a brief synopsis of Morris's childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man. And even as his family settled for good in Texas football, Morris' passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then jumps ahead for 23 years to adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid). now a baseball coach and chemistry professor at Big Lake High School (in real life, it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player, but that did not work out. <br /> <br /> Morris's team is struggling and he talks about giving up on his dreams. They saw the table, saying he should try a Major League team. On several occasions, when he addresses them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he plays. Morris seems not to be convinced, but agrees to make a deal with his players, in which, if they win the district, he will try a Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins the district and, adhering to the end of the deal, Morris watches a test of rays of Tampa Bay Devil. Phenomenally, he plays 98 miles per hour - faster than he played during his minor league career and an excellent speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another test with the team, Morris receives a contract with the Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves you with a difficult decision - stay in your comfortable life or once again chase your dream of Major League going through the bulk of the minor league to earn little money and spend months at a time off House. And the decision is even more distressing than during the first season of the minor league because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs with the Devil Rays, starts at level AA and climbs quickly to Level AAA, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season ends, the chances of him being "called" are getting smaller and smaller. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I love this movie. There are many great performances and friendly characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling into Morris. In addition, the film does a great job portraying professional baseball at the major and minor league levels. And above all, it teaches the timeless message of holding fast to their dreams, even when they seem distant and almost impossible to attain. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie has some flaws. Although it is usually accurate, it overdoes and even manufactures some things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. In addition, except for a scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But considering the leftist zeal of Disney, this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, many of the exaggerations / inventions were made to make the story more dramatic. However, the 20-minute documentary on Morris included on the DVD brings some information that makes its story more dramatic, but is excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth until your family settles in Texas forever. when he was 12, Morris repositioned 14 times. And his minor league starting career ended after four surgeries in which he lost half of the muscle on his left shoulder, which made playing at 100 km / h even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Jim Morris's story, it's good to not only watch "The Rookie," but to watch the DVD documentary, check out the above mentioned link for inaccuracies of the movie and probably also to read the biography of Morris, also titled "The Rookie." I did not read the book, but I hope one of these days. <br /> <br /> But overall, "The Rookie" is a very good portrait of a miraculous story and is a powerful testimony to the power of dreams. and the triumph of the common man. 8/10
