Who would not want to go on a trip with Peter Falk? This guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and moving movie that we all look for as a counterweight to all the bombastic special effects. Women will love all the romance advice for men, and men will love their study of father / son characters - one big scene after another. And it has just one advantage to be a true indie find. Obviously, this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser, who understands what it's like to be father and son, as well as laugh and cry over a lifetime. The most fun part, however, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could say that it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and an actor really enjoying the special craft of Peter Falk. Really delicious. Let's hope this movie hits theaters around the country soon, so everyone can have the chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and the staff.
