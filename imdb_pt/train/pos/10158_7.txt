Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film which is a traditional translation of Gospel stories. The music is great, you realize how Jesus' world was (I've been there), and June enters the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. The narration of money is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was misused. 2. There is no margin for history as Cash puts in some of its faith-based music. 3. For not being convincing, I doubt that this will be widely distributed again. <br /> <br /> I would love to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
