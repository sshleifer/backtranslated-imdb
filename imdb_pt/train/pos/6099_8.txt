I still got grainy, late at night, no cable, cheap VHS dubs this show from waaaaaayyyy back when, late at night, commercials and everything, when I would stay up any strange time that would beat this show - just so I could record it, it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really ABOUT Freddy Kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything other than a Rod Serling-esquire announcer. Instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare, using the traditional horror themes of horrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> From the episode where a teenager accidentally says "I'll love you forever" to the wrong girl, and is stuck with it (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together ...), to the one in which a young stewardess goes home with a strange man, only to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses, and I only vaguely remember comparing blind dates with hockey (and injuries and penalties that accompany it). definitely the most scary thing in the series. <br /> <br /> One episode had Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza marketer with a tasty new secret ingredient. Not original, but still scary and fun .... <br /> <br /> Even so, some of the episodes were great. My personal favorite was "It's a miserable life," where a young man is stuck working at his parents' diner when he wants to go to college. Talking to himself and making small puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until one night when a strange guy gets in the car and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a thug with a gun - it ends with all the hallucinatory episode is just that - the last thoughts that go through the kid's head ... along with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many of Freddie's Nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected tales) followed his girlfriend, who was also injured, but not killed in the drive-by, and taken to " the hell hospital. "They cram all the scariest cliches of the hospital nightmare, and then some - from having their mouths shut accidentally - or awake during an operation - to have their dead boyfriend try to lure him into the morgue for a small hug. <br /> <br /> Again, this was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were a lot dumber, like almost all the ones that were available in the video. They put the evil-doers as representatives of the show, and then no one likes them, finds the show stinky, and then they do not put it on video anymore. It's a Miserable Life is only available on PAL DVD in England - but I'll still buy it.
