Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have had the funding and publicity that the latest Hollywood blockbusters win, but it has double the emotional impact. The tale revolves around this unique Utah family and are the connections between the family people who provide the film with their punch. The main leader (Giovanni Ribisi) does his part very well, in no time he lets you believe that he is acting all his feelings. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me. When the two were together in scenes, they limited their lines to each other, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great movie.
