There was some hesitation on my part about what this movie had to offer. For starters, the cast did not look right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in "24" and the preview did not seem to offer anything challenging for him or the audience. Eva Longoria seemed out of place, and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the film finally ended, I was not completely unhappy to have seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, The responsible parties took a little more care to observe the narrative gaps and give a little more care to character development. We've seen such threats before, and this has made the main conflict much more challenging for writers. As a public, we do not want to repeat the same old story. We want to see something different, to be excited and entertained. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with the cast. From Kim Basinger's first delicious lady. She carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the play memorable. Michael Douglas has been and done this before. Unfortunately, the president is an entity that does not care about its destiny. Sutherland resumes his "tough" approach with enough force to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does an acceptable job as the newcomer. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride to whatever it is. That's right.
