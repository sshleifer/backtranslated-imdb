JUST CAUSE is an imperfect but decent movie, kept together by strong performances and some creative writing (albeit extremely predictable). Sean Connery is a crusader against the death penalty brought to save a seemingly innocent black youth (Blair Underwood) from the maximum penalty. To get things right, Connery ventures into the crime scene, where he must compete not only with the passage of time but with a nosy sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Turns and twists and reversals are plentiful - some surprising, some not - as the old crusader tries to unravel the mystery. The end of the climax is a little ridiculous, but it pays to take a look at a slow night.
