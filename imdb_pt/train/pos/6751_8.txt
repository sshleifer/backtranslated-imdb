Very good film by Preminger; Sometimes labyrinthine, it explores scenarios and locations from various angles and perspectives, as if it were a film about the nature of modern city dwellers and how they live. In that sense, it is visually and spatially satisfying, as his hero, a good cop of bad temper, goes into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plaque on his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and it has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but not remarkable. Gary Merrill makes a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth giving a good contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable, and seemingly bad guy seems to be continually challenging his enemy for the simple fact of being emotionally open, unlike the moralistic, wounded cop who pursues him. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie, which seems to be transient for everyone involved. For the director, Preminger is a kind of meeting with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks at the time the film was made. The supporting cast - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is understandably more optimistic, since everyone was on the right track. Preminger, as a serene observer as ever, allows events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, since the morally ambiguous end is somewhat disappointing, since the game of cat and mouse between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal of the that any simple film contain, let alone solve. <br /> <br />
