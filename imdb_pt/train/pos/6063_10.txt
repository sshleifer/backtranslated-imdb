The Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a movie about a young prince (Simon) who is banished from his kingdom because his father (the king) is killed by the clich√© "evil counselor." This movie is about the adventures of Simon. The special effects, plot, acting and generally everything about this movie is bad. However, it's so bad that it's funny. You will continue to watch this movie simply because it is so bad that it is funny, and, as the other movie critic said, it is so bad that it is good.
