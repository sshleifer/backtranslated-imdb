This was surprisingly clever for a TV movie and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. In fact, it was well researched, and I can only assume it was written by someone who went through a similar experience because it had all the little details. The characters were well-designed, and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I liked the most was that they made them specific and clever, and there was no dulling of the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it was not a "diet out of control, caused by pressures imposed on girls by the media." we are not going to approach ... ") His mother was not completely ignorant - too often on television, they pick up a subject that EVERYONE has some conscience and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remnants on Earth who do not" Oh, my world is all crooked, doctor, please explain everything to me as if I were a small child, "etc.) It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and not even she saw the and the scenes where Beth was vomiting were NOT EXCLUSIVELY melodramatic and sensational, and focused more on the need for secrecy of the bulimics and their lack of control.The scene in which Beth tells her mother that she is bulimic t It made me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Ok, so I liked those pieces. What did not work so well for me was the ending, which took us back to the territory of the TV movies we knew and did not particularly love, but I think they had to shut it down. "You can also cure your child's eating disorder if you have a lot of money and live in America ..." And can I say again that I really like Mare Winningham? She's great.
