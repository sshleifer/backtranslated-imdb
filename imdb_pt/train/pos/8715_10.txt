This movie is by far the most beautiful I have seen in a long time! Wonderful animation and adorable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) Made this a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those with whom I saw him. I still want to see it again, but I did not have the time. Better than Toy Story, which was good too, but not so good.
