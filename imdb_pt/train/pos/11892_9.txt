Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, he is dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son when she dies of cancer. In A in the Amours, teenage sexual experimentation leads to violent clashes with her family. Here we have a spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take on a sexy ex-convict. His motivation is a bit foggy, since Loulou is unable to read or discuss anything more challenging than TV shows; on the other hand, he has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show that physique - he would have been great as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give a tasteless and unimpressive performance (she gave many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want - see the scene in the bar where he is stabbed in the gut, runs away and seeks treatment, then restarts with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with those coal black eyes and anguished look, plays Nelly's husband beautifully; is a good repeat of pairing in Coup de Foudre.
