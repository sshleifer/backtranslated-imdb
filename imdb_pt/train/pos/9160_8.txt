In all the comments praising or condemning Dalton's performance, I thought he was excellent. He does not interpret Rochester as a rich and spoiled boy, but as a powerful and malcuidado man. I liked this version, although the aspect of the video was sometimes a distraction, and the scenes with Jane and St. John never consolidated. I give this an 8.
