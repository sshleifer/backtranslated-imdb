A good movie about downs syndrome. A mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good, but he has lows. The mother does not think she can raise him, so she gives it to some people who have 15 children and 11 children. the mother does not like it and she thinks he should be with her family (I also agree) so they take it to court & the family is broken and the grandparents lose, does this never really say if the mother and daughter makeup? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, still good and has some unintentional laughter!
