Watching this movie again brought back some great childhood memories. I'm 34 now, have not seen since I was 12-14. I had almost forgotten about this movie, but when I watched it again recently, some scenes literally brought a tear to my eyes! That little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like revisiting my childhood. It was an absolutely incredible experience for me. I will always enjoy this movie for that reason. I hope some of you readers may relate to my experience, not to this particular movie, but to any movie you have not seen in a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Thank you for reading
