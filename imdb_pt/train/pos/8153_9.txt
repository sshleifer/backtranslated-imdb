This is a very funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch. It's a very short movie, and I'd definitely recommend watching it more than once, you'll "catch it" more the second time around. <br /> <br /> It's like the lumbar puncture, but the rap version. There's a lot of attitude in that, which can be a negative thing in rap-influenced movies, but it's just a total take and not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> There are many highlights, one of those types of movies that you will find yourself quoting phrases with your friends, and this will generate laughs. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is the 'guerrilla in the middle'. section. Great video, great!
