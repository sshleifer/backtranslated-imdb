Breathtaking, this is undoubtedly the best anime design of all time. I first saw the castle in the sky in the late 80's as a child and left a lasting impression. years passed and I forgot the title of the film, and just by chance surfing the internet I found this masterpiece again. After reading the reviews and reviews of other people, I am not surprised that it has been so acclaimed and touched by many because it leaves a good impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must-see for all children and adults. It is best not to give the story, so I would say watching this movie will be a clear and open mind. If you have kids, treat them with that, I promise they will love it. there is not much to say about this work of art, but if you have not seen it yet, enjoy it.
