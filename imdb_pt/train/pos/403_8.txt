I remember that the trailer for Legend of Zu was quite impressive and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (my all time favorite), Storm Riders, I decided that I should watch that one as well. I know there is a lot of criticism in Ekin Cheng's acting skills everywhere, but he is my favorite in Hong Kong so far (much better than Nicolas Tse) and he is one of the factors that I liked about that movie. No doubt this movie is a work of art from beginning to end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this movie. They must have worked hard on it and deserve good credit for it. The plot of the movie was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story (I think Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but this is not what you expect when watching an action movie. I wish there was more martial arts action with fists and fists instead of battles with magical abilities, but well, that's life and it never happens the way you want it. And why did they sound like supersonic planes in battle for the sky in the end? That's really funny. The Legend of Zu can not be a Man Called Hero in my eyes, but it flows like a video game and that's not a bad thing. If a company decides to publish games in this movie, I will not be surprised as it carries all the elements of the video games. Good job. Please make more fantasy movies like this one.
