I really loved it although while reading the comments it was quite disturbing for me .. But as a fan of anime art I can fully understand this perfect artwork even though some was against my cultures and believes .. But hey, world of art .. !! the beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing.It is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect the one who made it.only someone who is extremely open can make this movie bold.isn't absolutely for children..cim although the characters are cute and adorable, but they go through some disturbing adventures that can not be erased (sorry if spelling is wrong) of their memory.
