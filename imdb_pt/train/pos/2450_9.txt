I have been to this program since I was 14 years old and I have loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just funny! You're going to enjoy this show a lot because it shows you something new and funnier every day and my favorite part is when Benny always has his last comments about George after every punchline about his giant fat head. * Laughter * I laughed and watched with my friends at home, it would be as if we were watching a funny but short film. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a fun comedy series for the whole family and fun for everyone and you will definitely have fun - I enjoyed it! And if you have not already watched, I suggest you start watching because you would not want to stop watching. Even though there are no more new episodes, I still like the reruns. It's still funny. It never wears out. <br /> <br /> 9/10
