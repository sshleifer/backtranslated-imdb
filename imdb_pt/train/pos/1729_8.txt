In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decides to flee a prisoner of war camp using a Gymnastic Jumping Horse on the patio. In 1950, it was decided to film his account, and began a peculiar British film - the history of the Military Prison Camp that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> The Wood Horse is one of the quietest movies I've ever seen. There are no great dramatic moments, but a firm plot ends up turning into a climax that has more tension because the story does not give rise to improvisable dramas, jumps or improvised songs (something about to happen!). It is totally off your time and works beautifully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson led a cast of extras and (I do not think) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and silent. They keep the emotion out of their roles. As many were, until recently, former employees, I suspect they recreated their wartime roles as "Officers and Gentlemen." This emotionless approach does not diminish any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most War Escape Movies, the story does not end in barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me stuck to the end.
