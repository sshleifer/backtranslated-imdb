Any story comprises a premise, characters and conflicts. Characters planning their own game promise triumph, and a militant character readily lends itself to it. The premise of Ardh Satya is summed up by the poem of the same name written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "ek palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya?". "The delicate balance of right and wrong (commonly seen in the busts of blind justice in the courts) has impotence in one dish and dexterity in another." The needle in the center is a half truth?

This causes a profound impact on the protagonist and lays the foundation for many of the subsequent events to follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem. <br /> <br /> The film goes to great lengths to make a part of the poem. However, Chitre's words are very powerful and, at best, the film combines with the poem in all respects. <br /> <br />
