The appeal of old movies like this is that you can see a real picture of life on the move for over 100 years. Here are many people leaving a factory, all dead by this time and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the invention they are walking before. I was shocked to read a reviewer saying that this movie is boring as home videos today, and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first movie of all time (it was the first movie done at a rate of 16 frames per second instead of the normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, all you see is a lot of people coming out of a building and passing the cinematographer on the way home from work, but that's a curiosity for dozens of reasons, not least. which is the first film made by the Lumi√®re brothers, which probably had a stronger impact on the development of cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
