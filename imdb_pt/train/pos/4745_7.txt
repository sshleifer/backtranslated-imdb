I can not understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce the American public to the dynamo who is Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it certainly is not great. The final sequence of the fight is well staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who coordinated the Matrix. But the release in English suffers from editing and dubbing. (I'm begging Hollywood studios to release these uncut movies with legends.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and FranÃ§oise Yip has a cool but brief role as the 701 woman. /> Black Mask has a strange gothic style that adds some interest but is overwhelmed with gun battles and explosions. More focus on Li's fantastic physical abilities were in order. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and get Fist of Legend if you want to see an incredible movie that really shows Li's abilities.
