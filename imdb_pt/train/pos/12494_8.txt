Finally, an indie movie that really offers some great scares! I watch most of the horror movies coming out ... Theatrical, Direct to DVD, Cable TV, etc ... and most of them are horrible ... some are watched ... even fewer are really good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I caught a screening of this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the public loved it ... and my wife and I love it! Not having any known actor, I assume the budget of this movie was pretty low, but you do not know it ... the movie looks fantastic ... the acting works totally for the movie ... the story is good ... and the scares are great! While most filmmakers focus only on scares, they often forget about developing stories and characters, two things that help deliver the scares more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley should know that character and story matter. It develops so much to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters and therefore gets more scared when they are in danger. Watch horror movies that cost $ 80 million to $ 5,000, I think "Dark Remains" to be one of the jewels out there. Check out this movie!
