I have not really seen many of the Columbus films ... actually, I guess I just watched one or two, besides this one. I've always liked Columbus in some way, even without seeing much of it. Peter Falk is and always has been the perfect choice for the character, because of his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) of the films was made in 2003. It's 35 years. And Falk was 40 when he made the first. The series consists of 68 movies (unless my countdown is off), all made for TV. Everyone knows the character, even though no one has seen a movie with him in the movies. This is a great achievement, if you ask me. The plot is very good. The only problem I have is that the killer and the murder are revealed early on (though this may be the same for all of Columbus's films), leaving no mystery, but as Columbo solves it, making it somewhat monotonous ( since there is not much to expect at the end of the movie). The pace is good, there is hardly a scene where you are bored. The performance is very good, particularly that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great dialogue exchanges in the movie. The characters are well written and reliable. The dialogue and script are exceptionally good for a TV movie. All in all, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for a TV movie, and definitely worth watching for any Columbus fan and / or crime / mystery films. 8/10
