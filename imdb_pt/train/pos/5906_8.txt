Doghi is a wonderful film and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. This is Uttara Baokar, who is usually excellent in most of his roles. Along with Kairee, he is an example of Marathon cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both films that tend to doactic - probably would have improved the film so as not to have the few scenes in which the social message is hammered. These scenes probably emerge from the filmmaker's political concerns, but the film is realistic. and moving enough not to need it. But, in addition to minor complaints, it's a movie that deserves to be seen more and I highly recommend it. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shine.
