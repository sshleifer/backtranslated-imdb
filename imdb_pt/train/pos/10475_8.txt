A friend of mine recommended this movie, citing my vocal and inflatable similarities with Des Howl, the main character in the film. I think to some extent I can see this and maybe a little more, I'm not quite sure if it's a flattering portrait or not. <br /> <br /> This is a very unique work, the only movie for which it can have more than a resemblance of glimpse would be True Romance, not for content or style of filming or for the rhythm of dialogue (Whale Music is much more, well, relaxed). But instead, they both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general I am a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example I recommend the Hard Core Logo) and this particular movie. He has an innocent charm, Des is not always the nicest guy, but there is something about him that attracts a kind of empathy.
