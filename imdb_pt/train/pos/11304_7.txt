I do not know under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The postman always plays twice" (I do not know if Viscounti has acquired the rights to the book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version), but thanks to the excellent direction of Visconti and the cast of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensitivities with great effect. The movie is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a bit too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I do not think Visconti has been very good at editing his films). I think film noir works best with a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep the viewer interested. Anyway, as much as I enjoy this movie and the remakes, I do not think anyone made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book.
