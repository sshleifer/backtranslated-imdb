**** Includes Spoilers **** I've been a fan of horror movies for many decades. Just when I think I've seen all the greats, another one appears to amaze me. I've never seen this movie before. It was a treat, off the beaten path too ... not just the way the ferry boat swamp wants. Here was a horror movie made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. The beautiful girl is fearless (gulp) for a change and saves the men, including the man she loves, the monster! How's this for a twist? This girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of the day, without shouting in her own shadow, without fainting with fear, without stumbling on a leaf as she ran. This girl was not afraid to live alone in an isolated hut far from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was in a hazy marsh rumored to be haunted. She even takes naps in the marsh grass outdoors ... like a regular version of Ripley from the 1940s. No snake, gator or ghost strangler would dare to bother this girl. Books on early feminist films should include this neglected work. <br /> <br /> Watch this if you're a fan, like me, of those wonderfully atmospheric classic B / W horror movies that they did only in the 30s and 40s and do not forget to use the iron turtle neck cast for protection.
