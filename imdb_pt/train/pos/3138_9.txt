Yes, I did, while I sit here red-faced, remembering to have felt almost guilty while watching a few weeks ago, while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential (in comparison) as "Dear Mom." <br /> <br /> How do you explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin" - I mean, the only ones who really did tell, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show, with terrible plans and a terrible performance - and, oh, yes, it was terribly funny! And the same applies to this "meeting" and "flashback" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it is stolen, and our friends (like them) jump on the personas of their old characters (if not in their costumes) and depart to find out what happened. Along the way, they reminisce about the series, and we see how it all came together in flashbacks, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing the young Adam and Burt from the TV series. It was really interesting to see backstage from the old series, and Adam and Burt just came back perfectly to the character (even if they were not really in the character - well, you would have to watch to see what I mean.) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you will hate it. If - God forbid - you really thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney made acceptable Batmans, then you'd hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and are still willing to admit that you've never missed an episode - well, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
