The kids, ages 7 to 14, had a huge success with this movie that we gave a copy to all the other kids on our birthday list this year. They all loved it! Children 2 to 7 watch them repeatedly and often, and we have fun watching them. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to entertain children for so long, and offer laughter to adults, too. Most take more than the first. <br /> <br /> High quality production and an excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George - athletic, energetic and totally credible, with a kind innocence and a particular ability to carry a tree in the face - well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law, the Thomas Haden Church as the rival of evil, and all the others. This is fun.
