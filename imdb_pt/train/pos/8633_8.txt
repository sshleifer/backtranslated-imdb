Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A box on a bench, everyone walks over it. So your friend, a writer who does not like books, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he's giving up. He intends to spend the rest of his life making lots of money and sleeping with many women. And he can do just that. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the amount of deaths (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, this would be a farce. There are countless jabs in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a kind amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is the most attractive of her. Definitely worth a look.
