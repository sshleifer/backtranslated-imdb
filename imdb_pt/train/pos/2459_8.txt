A beautiful and touching film that deserves a broader view of what is likely to be achieved. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second generation of Turkish immigrants, who tries to break the mold. Not entirely at home with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience becomes a struggle to meet and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be, despite the family and friends. Director Natasha Arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that she has depth without becoming a thoughtful philosophical discourse, and taking advantage of Xian Gao's choreography skills offspring spectacular fighting sequences. In the end, though, it's the impressive debut performance of Semra Turan that gives this cinematic spirit. Raw charisma and necessary martial arts skills are praised from the heart to make your personal drama believable. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
