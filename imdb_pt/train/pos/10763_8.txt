I must admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I was hoping it was the kind of All American Propaganda that we here in Europe did not like so much. I was wrong. This is not propaganda, in fact, it is by no means political. <br /> <br /> Describes the events of September 11 through the eyes of firefighters called to the scene shortly after the planes crash. It's an incredible coincidence that this documentary was filmed! This film was initially filmed as a documentary about a novice firefighter from NY becoming "a man". We can only thank the filmmakers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal they faced. <br /> <br /> A great job. Absolutely stunning stuff. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Greetings,
