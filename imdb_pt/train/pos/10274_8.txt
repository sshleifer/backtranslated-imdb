SPOILERS This is an exciting movie about grifters. But who is cheating who here? When does the hunter become the prey? This dark and somber movie is slow and seductive. He pulls you and drags you down the proverbial garden path, just to shake you just as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> He has a riveting script, with good acting (at least of the leads). I did not realize the background music, but it was never shocking, so it must have been done right. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I do not usually go for this genre but this one sucked me and kept it on until the end.
