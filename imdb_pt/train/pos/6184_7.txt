As this is Black History Month and I am reviewing the achievements of many African Americans on film in chronological order, I got this VHS movie from the library because Duke Ellington and his Orchestra were in it. His jazz version of "Rhapsody" by Franz Liszt was the highlight of this mix of comedy of musical and musical mysteries. Many other numbers I've enjoyed were especially Sweet Marijuana by Kitty Carlisle, Carl Brisson's "Cocktails for Two" as well as his duet with Carlisle about it earlier, and those of Michael Gertrude who is great as the woman you love to hate . Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably get a little too long with their love / hate prank as the producer and detective, but they grow on you. And Toby Wing is a sexy stupid provocation like Nancy who keeps trying to say something to Oakie, but gets a "Not now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a motive for the killings that take place, I was not surprised by the revelation of who did it. And take a load of how naked the women are here (though, of course, your breasts are covered, either by the hands or by a fragile top). This was very obviously pre-coded. It pays to look at any fan of movies interested in this sort of thing. P.S. As a longtime Louisiana resident, I like to note when someone was born here as Carlisle was a native of New Orleans.
