The usual cat-and-mouse jokes abound until Jerry leaps into an invisible ink bottle. He has the brilliant idea of ​​torturing Tom without his knowing. The cat gets smart and tries to do things to make him "see" Jerry, even if it's not foolproof. Of course Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike the dog in the act (even if it's late in the short, and his contribution is minimal) Brilliant short animation that kind of reminded me of one with the white mouse that scares Tom so badly. Most of the jokes work and all violent as any good tone and jerry short should be. This hilarious cartoon can be found on Disc one of Spotlight's collection "Tom & Jerry" DVD <br /> <br /> My Grade: B +
