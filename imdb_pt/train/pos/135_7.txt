It was an excellent piece for the puppet series because this movie showed the whole series, from one to seven. And this was about a woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would never have imagined that the puppets would be in pain. In addition, he showed some of the series of dolls I have not seen and I see him as bad as part two. It showed a Torch appearance that can turn things and humans, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet master of the first part. He also showed little aliens from part 4 which was also cool, showed episodes of other people that may be good for them and did. So thanks to this Puppet Master will be a great success.
