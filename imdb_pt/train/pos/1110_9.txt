I think you'd have to be from the US to have lots of jokes. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. You can not compare the quality of filming with those, of course, but having the videographer's trip was obviously done on purpose. The Killer Tomato is a hundred times better than the Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure the people of France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this movie is not for a worldwide audience. And while I'm not a trained movie critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing at the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were aching at the end of the movie.
