Among standard liner-like action movies, where acting and logic are checked on the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person in charge of the casting had put "good" actors in that film, it would have been worse (except Richard Dawson, who actually acted well, if you can call himself "acting"). I love this movie! Running Man is, in all likelihood, God's gift to man (alright, maybe just men). Definitely the most quoteable film of our time, so I'll separate you with my favorite quote: "It's all part of the rich pattern of Brenda's life, and you better get used to it." Ahh, more people were called "Brenda" for citing this movie than I can imagine.
