This movie deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy. Although I found this world morally repulsive, the film did the best the narrative should do, and that leads us to an experience we would otherwise never experience. Tim Meadows so convincingly portrays Leon Phelps, and the story drew me to the reckless world of Leon, which I momentarily forgot that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it. Here is the downfall of the film, because its great and bold achievement in the narrative comes at the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of viewers will respond only to the story of this film that is on the surface, and reject this story, I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that I loved it. I loved not only his fascinating insights into the deluded playboy mind, not only for his amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sexual drive, but also for his courage to explore fearlessly in the shadows of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just funny.
