Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ended their career together. Remember that the Grumpiest of Old Men and Oddest Couple have already made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most beloved comedy teams in the last 100 years. Not as "cheeky" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern routine of the Marx Brothers. Such as the physical comedy, as well as the mixed mixture of chaos that Marx, Chaplin, and Keaton were so famous. In Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau interpret complete opposites that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as the Chaplins. The joke is usually in itself as oppose to pass the joke to another. It's not your typical boy movie, it's, in a way, a maturing comedy with two old men as opposed to two young teenagers in their heyday. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is enough entertainment. Although this movie is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
