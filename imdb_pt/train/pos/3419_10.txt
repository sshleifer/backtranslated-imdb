Having just "welcomed home" my 23-year-old daughter of a year in Iraq, Camp Anaconda's medical support unit, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other returning veterans try to better understand their mentality on arrival and not wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your opinion about war and peace, this movie serves as a great start for all Americans to begin healing the emotional emptiness of our returning veterans. The overriding statement of the entire film is "Take Action" about the problem. Incredibly emotional movie. I recommend this movie to the vets veterinarian the whole mature family and ask them to follow up with a plan to hear the comfort help the returning Gulf War veterans. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost a year later & My daughter saw this DVD. It took into account her emotions and, in fact, made a commitment to recover for another 6 years. Her time spent in the sand was that she did something good. Balad's local children received first-class medical treatment for a number of common diseases they normally could not afford for free with an escort and a translator. His look over his shoulder on his Iraq tour was. "We've changed some hearts and minds back there" Great DVD you have to keep an open mind and see all sides
