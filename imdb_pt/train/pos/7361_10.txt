This film would normally rank as the worst film production of all time. Ever. But in my opinion, it's possibly the funniest. The horrible direction and script make this movie priceless. I bought the film while sifting through the bargain DVDs at my local pounds store. Me and some friends then watched it, admittedly while a bit drunk. It soon turned out that it was not a normal movie. Instead, an invaluable relic of what will likely be the last James Cahill movie. At first we got confused and shouted for the DVD player to be turned off, but fortunately in our abnormal state no one could be bothered. Instead, we watched the direct movie. In the end, we soon realized that we had found any dream of washing, something that you can laugh in an acceptable manner for hours while laughing at all the wrong reasons. We soon showed all of our other friends and they also agreed, this was not an abysmal movie job. This was a movie that you can actually get wet from laughing. This was a movie that anyone can enjoy. That was great.
