Thank God, ABC got it instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is actually Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best way possible. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if an experience with death and fate early in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I certainly enjoy his productions. I also like plaid floors, pies, talking toys, gravelings and other mischievous items :) Although a bit "Burtonesque", I certainly think this has its own niche that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground . Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood colliding with each one and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest!
