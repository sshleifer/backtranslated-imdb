La Coda Dello Scorpione (also known as the Scorpion's Tail) was the continuation of director Sergio Martino for the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the giallo par excellence, with all the aspects that the fans of the genre knew and love. Enigmatic plot, pretty girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a little blood come together to make a piece of Italian exploration. <br /> <br /> A bunch of gialli favorites, both in front and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argio gialli around. There is the aforementioned Martino adding his touches as director, great giallo Ernesto Gastaldi as the writer, Bruno Nicolai creating the song, and a host of stars and giallo stars, such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and the attraction Anita Strindberg. <br /> With all that talent behind it, does Scorpione offer? You bet. The film works on many different levels. It's an exciting murder mystery, a tense and violent horror film and a thriller of suspense. All in all one of the best gialli back. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some points in the film, he seems to be channeling Argento into his approach. For example, there is a direct violation of the scene in Bird With the Plumage of Crystal, where the killer tries to break the door, which actually surpasses Argento's move. <br /> <br /> Is there a problem with the movie? ? Hmmm ... just the smallest ones. First, all the scenes that are not following the murders or the romance between the two leaders begin to get bored. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will come out of nowhere and you will be back in the rhythm of things. <br /> <br /> In addition, in the end, the twists are a bit too bizarre. I mean, what good are the scorpion pins? If you do not pay much attention to the dialogue, you can easily get lost with the weaving, torsion plot. <br /> <br /> But despite these little complaints, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, suspense-filled, all-movie fun for giallo fans. Look for it!
