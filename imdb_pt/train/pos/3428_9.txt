I saw this movie tonight in New York at Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I did not read much about it, as I knew I would see, no matter what. All in all it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" declarations, which, for me, has left politics out. Soldiers spoke mostly of their awareness of toxicity in their training in training camps, and how difficult it was when they returned to civilian life. It was great to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war, but refusing the order to return when it was against personal morality. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says that has not seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls.
