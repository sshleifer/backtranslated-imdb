This was a success at the South By Southwest (SXSW) film festival in Austin last year, featuring a great cast led by E.R., Gloria Reuben, and a John Glover chewing scene. Although filmed on a small budget in New York, the film looks and sounds fabulous, and takes us behind the scenes of rehearsing and editing what the actors call "The Scottish Play" as a reference to the word "Macbeth." thought to bring the ancient curse of the game. The acting company displays all the emotions of the piece itself, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and a bit of fun as well. The games begin when a talented actor is replaced (in the lead role) by a known "handsome face" of the TV soap opera scene in order to attract larger crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds well. Good soundtrack and good performances around. The DVD includes comments from the director and some deleted scenes as well.
