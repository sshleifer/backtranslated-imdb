Granted I'd seen some "Speed ​​Racer" but I'd never watched it and I'd also seen other shows with these characters dressed like birds flying a ship called Phoenix and another spinning around a spaceship that looked like an ocean The giant ship and it flew back at times for some reason and it was really dark and difficult to understand by someone who was maybe five. This one, although I watched almost every episode and the incredible one for me at the time, was that this show had some resolution for that. In fact it turned out, the bad guys did different from almost every American cartoon, where nothing really concludes like the last episode of the Transformers generation that ended with Galvatron and this new villain swearing to get the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never coming at home, with GI Joe with Cobra still ready to try again and so on. This one finished and presented a pretty cool robot that gained new weapons while the show progressed, it was a little bland to begin with, since it could not fly and it only had some cool arms. As he continued, he got a straight shot like Android 16, used against Cell in Dragonball Z, so that weapon evolved to include razor blades that fired. Then the big robot even got wings to be able to fly and even more weapons were incorporated in the wings. He would also have some allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called Bobo in America. The villains not only consisted of Dr. Hell, but a very strange person who was half man half woman and a guy with a flying head. Interesting show and it was kind of nice to see a conclusion.
