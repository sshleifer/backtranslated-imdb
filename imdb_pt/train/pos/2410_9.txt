This movie is one of the most provocative movies I've ever seen. He does not seek to tell the whole story, but merely portrays an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is darkly witty, playful, and seriously faithful to the elements of Jewish tradition and the interpretation of modern scriptures. Judas is much more common than other portraits, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but a grossly misguided man, terribly misguided in his zeal. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed - very human and at the same time divine. The final dialogue is carefully done and serves as the kind of small talk two powerful men can make when they end up committing an atrocity. I watched this movie again and recommended it to others.
