This movie is good for what it is and unpretentious; I did not watch it twice though: I am a completist of Peter Cushing and that's why I watched it. The best feature of this film is BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar movies, it does not drag its feet forever, since each of the four (plus one) segment lasts less than 30 minutes, with the last one under 10. Good unusual vibrations. In the first segment, the writer of terror who suffers from "writer block" moves to an old isolated house for inspiration. He finds a lot of him when he begins to visualize one of his fictional fools. Conspiracy device similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use from the point of view: is the writer getting mentally ill ... or (as the final shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with her husband's phobias to drive him crazy and protect his properties .. Still, Will the intriguing bima survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two lost friends gather in the same isolated house but can not help to visit a bizarre horror. museum with the wax statue of love long lost from his youth, which once separated them. From the guardian of the Gothic museum, they learn that the woman portrayed is a dead ax wielding a murderer ... or was it? <br /> <br /> The third segment was the least interesting for me. <br /> <br /> Fourth shows a horror movie actor - who thinks he is the best of them all - sunk deep in the low-budget C movies. Seeking a fantasy to give more credence to his fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> The performance is fair, with the two initial segments contributing the most. Good movie, taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing, nor Lee ... but worth watching.
