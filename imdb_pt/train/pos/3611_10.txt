I saw this movie after I saw Blue Crush and other Michelle movies, I thought she had a bleak future in this business. I was extremely wrong after watching her performance on "Girlfight". I was amazed at how she captures the thrill of a fighter but also a warrior. In this movie the way she confronts her father about her treatment and her brother, the way she conveys her anger at being hit. Her character learning curve in the film of her can not always put up a wall and hide from love, or that just because she has power, she will not win. I believe that role was perfect for Michelle, although she had no previous experience, the director via talent, I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her.
