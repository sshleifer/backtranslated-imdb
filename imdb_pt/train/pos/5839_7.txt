The last (I believe) of the films that The Boys did with Hal Roach, this is also the last really funny movie they did, before they went to the 20th century fox who so famously unmasked their talents. Although there are weak times - the business with the "lung tester", for example, is a bit, ah ... exaggerated (but worth having, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but overall this movie is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) has appeared in other L & H movies, and he is delightfully menacing here as the doomed Nick Granger. The scene in which The Boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ("Looks good, smells good, and probably tasty.") Is one of my favorite moments in the play. Stan and Ollie will always be nice companions in the lives of their millions of dedicated fans.
