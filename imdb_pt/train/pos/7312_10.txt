It took me a while to really enjoy John Carpenter's Halloween. As a kid, I remember I really enjoyed the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and it took a long time to get to the point. I watched it a few times recently and now I know I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and blood. It's not about naked girls and lame jokes. It's about the worst night of Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night your demented brother comes home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is supposed to be scary and I think it succeeds. It's also one of the first horror films, a subgenre of horror that I've always loved. Halloween has a very somber atmosphere, scary music and talented young actors, like Jamie Lee Curtis in his first role. Need I say more? Anyone who has ever seen, a horror fan or not, should do their film homework now. Very highly recommended!
