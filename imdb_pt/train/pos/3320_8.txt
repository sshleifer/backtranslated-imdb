I liked this movie, cute and funny. I found this movie to be a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this movie was when he made references to the New York Yankees. You have to be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Sorry to say this to Yankee fans. I recommend this picture for the whole family. Of course with your typical love / comedy movie, there is a long time in the film, with I'm in love and what I do, but the movie makes up for it with every slapstick moments. The movie shows a few moments of how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park) as the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always spoiled at the end of the season and how Sox's love and love with another human go hand in hand.
