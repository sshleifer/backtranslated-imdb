Surprised to see the low score of this movie. I just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and I remembered why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, to a time when Michael Keaton was a comedy guy and you can find some joy in this movie. It's a gentle comedy - the kind Ron Howard specialized in - but if that's what you like, you should check that out. Keaton's understated charm is ideal for this project. "Gung Ho" is a bit dated, because it happens in the last stage of the pre-global economy world, when it still mattered what country a company was based in. That said, it offers laughter and a lesson in how people can learn from each other to great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and have fun without remembering one. scene in particular you really liked, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but steady stream of laughs. It's like an I.V. drip. And I mean it in a good way.
