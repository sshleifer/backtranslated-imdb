It's just two episodes in a five-part drama, but I can already say that's one of the best things I've ever seen. This is on TV, on the silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it's almost demoralizing! As a viewer, it's so much fun that I'm bothered with the episodes for a fortnight instead of Monday through Friday. Of course, all these negative aspects are really positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern guy who used to appear in TV dramas. In comparison to the movies, the TV dramas always seemed to be old-fashioned, very tame, and well, usually boring! "Five Days" really brought the drama of TV into the 21st century, so, at least for me, it's a change of mindset. Go watch.
