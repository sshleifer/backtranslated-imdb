This movie is like marmite. Either you love it or you hate it. If you enter this movie expecting a suitable film with decent production values, a good plot and great characters, you will loathe. If you get into that movie expecting a low-budget slasher, you'll probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you enter this movie expecting to see one of the craziest characters ever filmed in the form of Harry Russo you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of the insane and murderous coke demon. <br /> <br /> Special effects are abysmal at best, but really, who cares? If you are the type of person who is prepared to watch a Schizophreniac film: The Whore Mangler, you have certainly seen countless blood-filled horror films. With the budget for which this movie was made, even if they had tried it, it would probably be mediocre at best. I'd rather laugh at something abysmal than not be affected by the mediocre. <br /> <br /> To summarize, you will probably hate this movie, but if you are one of the few who decides to see it anyway, it will become the best thing since sliced ​​bread # 2 I hate marmite.
