I found it very interesting that the film really bridged the gap between my American culture and that of the creators, that is, the Chinese. It becomes a story about values ​​and makes the observer re-evaluate his or her own choices in life and loyalty to institutions. Incredibly, he managed to do so in a gentle, slightly humorous way that only looks in retrospect to threaten his status quo. I enjoyed the movie and watched it again if I could.
