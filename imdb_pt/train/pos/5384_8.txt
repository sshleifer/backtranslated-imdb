I thought the movie was pretty well made for a TV movie, and contained a lot of action and humor. I found the value of entertainment worth watching, and would watch again or a similar show again. I'm disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I can see the possibility of a series of action based on this concept or a sequel to Sean again playing for even higher "cash" bets, since his life would be back online anyway. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played the role very well, and reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux in Days of Our Lives. - the soap opera.
