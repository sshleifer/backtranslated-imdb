Will Smith offers once again in a movie about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to correct his mistakes in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts !!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino come together and create a masterpiece that I recommend buying and keeping in your movie collection, because you will never get tired of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Will Smith as he is not just a brilliant actor but you can say that he has a genuine love for people and life that no doubt made him perfect for the character he played in this movie. You will feel yourself feeling your pain and anger, the frustrations about your love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, which by the way was fantastic as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact that your characters are falling in love. Woody Harrelson also stars in this Top Notch movie. I find it very difficult to write this review without distributing the key points of the plot ... All I can say is: Watch, and when you're sure you have nothing to interrupt, pick up the phone, sit down and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS agent Ben Thomas ... I thank Will Smith for another Great Movie !!!
