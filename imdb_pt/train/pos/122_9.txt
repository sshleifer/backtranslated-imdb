I had begun to lose my faith in recent films being flooded with the typical Hollywood genre film. Story lines fail, and camera work is merely copied from the last movie of similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical plot is not only fascinating, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you on a lovely journey every step of the way and takes you to Europe in 1945. We have all seen death being displayed in hundreds of thousands of ways, but the beauty of this film is like you pass Every slow movement that leads you to death. Unlike many movies, it does not cut after a second showing (for example) a knife, but it forces you to watch the devastating but sensual beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all get something different from what this movie is trying to say, but it's definitely worth taking the time to figure out what that really means. I'd love to talk more about the movie to anyone who wants to email me. Enjoy!
