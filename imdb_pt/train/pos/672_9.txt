This film has a constant and amazing rhythm supported by great performances (one of the best performances by Chamberlain) and a story that is revealed to us over time. <br /> <br /> In addition, music fully establishes the mood and helps maintain an uncomfortable, cautious, and somber tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story is enhanced by using aborigines, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous. <br /> Although they are not related so much in history as in the genre, this kept the same feeling within me as "Lathe of Heaven" by Ursula Le Guin (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember, "hacking and hacking" does not make a movie a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and anxiety that rests within us all.
