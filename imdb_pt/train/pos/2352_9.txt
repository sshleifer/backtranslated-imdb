I have to say, when "Pushing Daisies" came out I was immediately beaten by the fairy tale as scenario of such severity. The narrator made a cake of the whole ordeal by making the death seem as routine as, well, Ned (Lee Pace) making pies. And that bringing them back to life was so routine. <br /> <br /> Ned's trio, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), and sometimes the helper Olive Snook (Kristin) Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked a delight, made some fantastic conversations and nonsense. It definitely deserves the title of comedy / drama (romantic). <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck have created a shy couple and not so ready for love that is still exploring their feelings, even touching - an obstacle that seems to really be no obstacle with aids such as gloves, cellophane and quirky schedules around the apartment. But despite the embarrassment presented while working their feelings around a strange secret that few know, they still manage to show their chemistry on the screen by playing in scenes like when Ned gives the hives to Chuck. The presence of Olive, however, contributes to some moments of pause in the song and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season fell dramatically, putting a damper on a show that had real potential. In some of the episodes, the plot was rushed and awkward, making you ask "what happened?" both in the general plot of the dead person of the week and in the main plot. The addition of Chuck's father plus two half brothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the lines of the plot was almost recycled (the episode "Comfort Food" did not look like the episode "Bitter Sweets" in the fact that the dead person of week died in food?). Some touching moments (hives) helped to improve the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they approached, the writers decided to play another monkey key instead of letting the relationship develop (Oliver back from the monastery, Chuck's dead father comes back to life and does not come back, you get the photo). <br /> <br /> What a shame it did not work, but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy-smiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it is not "Dead Like Me ". Then again, it's in the "Pushing Daisies Time," according to Creator Bryan Fuller, so it makes plausible again. <br /> <br /> It should have lasted longer, but it's just melancholy thinking right now. Congratulations to any new show that tries to replace this short gem.
