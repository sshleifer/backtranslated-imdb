Seven-star stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collector who has a hidden reason to meet those who have fallen behind on their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while driving talking on his phone and the film follows his attempt to repair his crime, frankly, unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The plot is as subtle as a brick a green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the end of the Titanic was more surprising when compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is going on. <br /> <br /> I usually just like Will Smith when I'm in Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Nah" as whenever he tries to act serious only appears as a pathetic attempt to try to win an Oscar that he is so obviously desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I was not looking forward to the movie, although here it is very discreet. There are comedy flashes, but they are subtle, in fact, it was Will Smith's most unobtrusive performance I have ever seen and for that reason he was fantastic and, ironically, should be nominated for a grand prize. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was all great too - Rosario Dawson looked very well alongside the whole movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were just as good as all the other players. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a screamer - but he's not playing all the usual cliches and sentimental violins to give him no other choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart almost broke. You will be hard pressed not to encounter one of the situations that does not relate to your own life, which makes it even more real. <br /> <br /> I would give 8/10. Will Smith's show enters the drama without all the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and comes even better because of it.
