Opening credits: great. Music: ideal for this movie. Cinematography: despicable with great effect. <br /> <br /> Distressing excitement in a type of train accident. This is how out of control some lives can become. "Wonderland" portrays drug-induced savagery (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but shows how this really happens in our society. It is better than the representations of another wild group - those of Manson - because all the movies, books, etc. of Manson focus so much on Manson's insane mind, instead of the general picture of fame and cheap randomness that is so pervasive these days. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "Method-acting" in the movie, watch Kilmer in this movie. It shows how "The Method" can be fascinating in the right role. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers here are able to raise "out of control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of giving us cheap emotions.
