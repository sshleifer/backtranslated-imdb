I love Sabrina! It's one of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes are; the one in which she turns Libby into a nerd, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as high school, but they were better than the last grade, which was awful. Valerie was a good character, being more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation as to where they went! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they were not as good as their other friends.
