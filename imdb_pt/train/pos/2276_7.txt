If you've read Mother's Night and liked it so much (as I do) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a key element of Vonngut's writing - which in addition to your story is Vonnegut himself, You can not put a human mind on the screen. His humor and humor simply can not be transcribed by a script or even by the best acting performance. I believe this film goes far beyond asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but the frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does that mean the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie is successful because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a means for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in an unpretentious context. I've seen other versions of Vonnegut's book movies where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses the grip on his own craft. I would not put this movie as one of the best I've ever seen, but it's on its own legs as one worth watching. Taking Vonnegut's "voice" out of the film's narration or trying to insert it into whatever it is, Mother's Night tells its story brilliantly and preserves the fundamental lessons of the story without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
