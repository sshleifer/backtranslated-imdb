The 12th Disney Cartoon is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Even if a bit outdated, it deserves a place on the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> It's not among the top Disney jobs, but it's satisfying. One of the "simplest" works of Disney, yes, but it maintains a certain magic and enchantment (by which the old Disney is known). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this were a failure, there would be no more Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is like a return to Disney's first animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") because it brings back the fairy tale genre. It is not clear where the story goes, but I suppose it is somewhere in France, because this is based on a short story by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many nice characters, like Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno. (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main rats), the fairy godmother (for a fairy she is certainly funny), the birds, the king and the Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very intelligent and fun. I love his voice. It really has that mouse quality. Gus may not be so smart, but he's good-natured. <br /> <br /> The king is hilarious, but I think what makes him so funny is his short temper. The Grand Duke is a very nice and funny guy too. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and responsible for many of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is certainly one of the most charming of Disney. There is no doubt that Prince Philip's "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince, because they have a very similar appearance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) should not be nice. because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly, selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is kind, gentle, beautiful and kind. By the way, I think her pretty pink dress is a lot prettier than the Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, he raises his nose in the air, and those arrogant, snobby facial expressions make him funny. Ironically, he is very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with his stepmother's attitudes toward Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is a devilish and evil cat. However, there is nothing annoying about it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, though not among the best in Disney. The best song of this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many well-known talented voice actors such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. Despite being simple, the film has a good work of art as well as its nice details, though never anything "out of the world". However, the king's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.
