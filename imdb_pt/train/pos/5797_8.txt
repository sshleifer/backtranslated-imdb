And I do not say that in a bad way. I watched this film in the movies when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins, it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. . When we left the movie theater, Michael was our best friend, although we knew he had no idea about it. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've watched this movie show a few times, but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that sense of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So, I only saw this movie once and I believe it was a good decision not to watch again. If I saw him today, I know I could not help but criticize MJ's performance, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings about it are from a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see that my adult self interferes with my assessment and gives an 8 to memories and wonderful music. For that little boy who watched with admiration 20 years ago, that's definitely worth 10.
