This movie is brilliant in every way. She touches on the complexities of love relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script never condescends to any character, not even to the unhappy Johnny. It also benefits from direct direction, production design, casting and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and more different from "Cher" than she ever was, is a wonder to me. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and I just saw him again this Christmas Eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they also loved it. There is something for everyone with a heart and leaves you full of joy in the end.
