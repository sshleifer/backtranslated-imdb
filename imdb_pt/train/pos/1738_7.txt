This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star signing a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken outfit during the run! Jim Nabors is his boss (not very convincing) mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) Is assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly adherent to the contract. This is a funny movie in which Burt proves he is not very proud. I like it!
