This movie is really fun! If you would like to rest your brain for an hour, then go ahead and watch. It's called blonde and blonde, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends (especially if you're not very sober.) Pamela and Denise are still very hot girls. It is a mistake to judge this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLONDES! It's supposed to be light, funny and shallow. One more thing, I do not think the girls will like it and like this movie, but the guy will definitely like it.
