Call me stupid, but I loved the 2001 horror movie, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well represented, well run, etc! Everything was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely creepy and creepy (Paige's death), and simply sad (the first scene). I think the whole cast did a great job, especially the three protagonists: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met and got autographs during the filming of this movie - MUCH nice people!), And Marley Shelton. I am very sick of people calling this movie "another Scream clone". This movie is by no means a clone of Scream. In fact, this movie rings rings around Scream. It actually makes sense! Scream was also NOT the only film to feature a masked assassin. Excuse me, but it seems that Scream was a clone too (ahem ... Friday, Halloween, and many other horror movies also featured masked assassins). I also think the novelty of the killer with cupid mask is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all these horrible things. Another novelty (the nosebleed) paves the way to a fantastic end! The ending gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you did not like it the first time, see Valentine again and give it another try! <br /> <br /> PS - Keep an eye on my new site (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon...
