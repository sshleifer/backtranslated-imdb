If it's action and adventure you want in a movie, then you'd better look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to keep up with this mood, check out "The Straight Story". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth makes a compelling presentation as gentle and gentleman Alvin Straight in this true story of Alvin's journey on a lawn mower in three states to see his distant brother who has suffered a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels for a long time. winding road, making friends of strangers and handing out lots of grandfather-type advice on the family along the way. The story moves as slowly as the mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson that Alvin will offer. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which ranks a 7/10 in my book.
