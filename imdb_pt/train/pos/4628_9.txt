One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies that you would almost certainly miss. Unless you are a true art devotee, you probably will not see many documentaries. Only a handful gets any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year, a group of prisoners presents a play by Shakespeare. Director Hank Rogerson and his team accompany the troupe as the roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed, and performed. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us who have not been exposed to prison environments. . Despite the labels we know of (condemned, criminal, murderer, etc.), we soon begin to appreciate and respect these men as human beings who feel the thought. By chance, the piece chosen for the year of filming was The Tempest, with its pervasive focus on forgiveness and redemption. All actors deal with the relevance of the play in their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary, like a book, the best it can be. What we hope is that we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation to me. "The brave new world, which has such creatures in it."
