"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, wonderfully bizarre film, as only director Sirk could have done. The film is submerged in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramas and colorful contrasts. The connection between financial success and moral decadence is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to see the film as a prime example of what Sirk could do with the kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The acting in the film is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (she deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress), who manage to keep the film at a boiling point. Congratulations to Frank Skinner's pulsating punctuation, Russell Metty's brilliant camera work (each scene is a masterpiece in its own right), and the production design department. Also, the title song is a beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
