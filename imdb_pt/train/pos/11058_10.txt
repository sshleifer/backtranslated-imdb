I would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I have ever seen. had depth, and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together, there was still nostalgia and anticipation. the thought that maybe they do not get together ... it's an indie movie after all. this film was well written, directed and acted. the dance next to the road scene was magnificent.
