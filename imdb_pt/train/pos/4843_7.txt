In fact, this is one of those movies that you should give 7.5. The fact is that; as has already been said, is a lot of fun. Wonderfully atmospheric. Askey really comes across with an exaggeration, but it's a great vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will Hay. If you like old movies and trains, this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Strangely, it's the kind of movie you'll want to see again and again. It is friendly and charming, in a nice way, with all the nostalgic references that made a great war meal. The bunch of "strange" characters simply perform as they do in many other typical British war films. It would have been wonderful to have seen this movie if it had been recorded by Ealing studios. A pity that the original 1931 did not survive intact
