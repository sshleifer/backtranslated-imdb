What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio, and Senator McCarthy were together on a night of mental relativity? <br /> <br /> This delightful roman-to-clef never uses the real names of the characters so finely veiled and outrageously exposes not only to the individuals they must have been but also to what they have come to represent over time . If you are confused by allegory, or if you like your films served pre-digested and soft, you will not like this movie. It is a demanding work that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Dropping for the moment the strict avoidance of using the real names of the characters, we see Einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a United Nations group dedicated to nuclear weapons, being visited by Marylin Monroe, after filming the notorious seven-year itch scene that some say led to the end of his marriage to Joe DiMaggio. They have a beautiful interaction in which Einstein is faced with a proper professorial clumsiness surrounding the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a red. He is determined to extract Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the House's Unity Activities Committee, delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person, perhaps not as perfect as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein has become his mistress, although Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the Special Theory of Relativity. <br /> <br /> But there's more. <br /> <br /> Just like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which reveal one by one in scary flashbacks. It is these weaknesses, ultimately, that lend to mankind figures we can not but see almost exclusively in the abstract of today. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision and the statement of the film is clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> The insignificance is one of my top five films of all time. It's absolutely incredible.
