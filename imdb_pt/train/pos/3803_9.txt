What people can not understand about this movie is that it's not a beginning, middle and end, it's just the conclusion of a long TV series of 26 episodes. So remember that when everyone talks about how the world has not been exploited enough. Everything was done on the TV show. As big and impressive as the visuals are, I think the discussion between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the movie was what really made me love this movie. Seeing characters that I had followed over 26 episodes of fighting like that was distressing, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly by himself amidst the floating ruins while Lian-Chu edged his blade was almost shuddering. <br /> <br /> Next, we have a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these insanely impressive dragons (which had already been featured before in the series), while Gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I'm surprised that this particular scene has not been mentioned any more in the warnings. Any child who has a little common sense will be able to see that Gwizdo was not himself and was totally determined to strangle that little girl. It was enough to bother me, and I'm 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The world is incredible, the plot is much better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a good way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check out. :)
