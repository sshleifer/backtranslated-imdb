What surprised me the most in this film was the audience that attracted. Similar movies, such as Anita and Me, have never caused as much commotion as this movie, although I think it's probably because of the mention of 'Beckham' in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant movie conveying a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough, and put your mind on it, which is such a positive message for anyone watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of Keira Knightley's best films, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and she was great for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say that to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers because I do not think he was such a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a bit scary. <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant movie and a brilliant story
