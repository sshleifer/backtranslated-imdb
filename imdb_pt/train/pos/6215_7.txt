While I'm not a big fan of musicals, I loved the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies because they are so much fun. Of course, they may be a bit stereotyped, but even if you know what's going to happen, they're still very nice to watch. However, despite this, I was a bit disappointed with this tour. Part of this was because this movie does not have the wonderful support cast as you've seen in TOP HAT or WE SHOULD DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be lacking a bit - especially in the "fun" department. The silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films a charm that you simply can not do with FOLLOW THE FLEET. Also, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this is more of a jerk - as his fat head Rogers in trouble again and again. And as a result, it's much harder to like him or want to see them together at the end of the movie. In addition, although the song is from Irving Berlin, the songs do not seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs were so special and I can not remember any of them even though I've seen the movie. While this is still a cute and worthwhile film, it just lacks the glitz and magic of some of his other films. Good, but far from great.
