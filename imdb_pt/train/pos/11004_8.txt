In the near future, the common man above any suspicion of the suburb Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is hired by Digicorp, a huge corporation, to be designated as spy and steal secrets from its competitors, Sunways. Throughout his training, Morgan is brainwashed, takes on a new identity from Jack Thursby and travels for boring lectures. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advises him that nothing is as it seems to be. Morgan recognizes a new reality where he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise to me. This film was not released in Brazil, but the engaging and thrilling story is quite complex, with many plot points and with great script, direction and performances. In the last turn, I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall." This movie certainly deserves to be seen more than once, and I really did not like the last scene when the independent spy puts the disc in dispute at sea. I only know the director Vicenzo Natali of the fantastic "Cubo", and this second work I see is also stunning. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
