I spent years searching for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs) so that I could show it to my kids. The movie is funny, and Spike and his band members show why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be so good to play so insane. I like and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about a quarter-century headquarters, with a crew of misfits who are firefighters and the department's band (when it is not fighting the fires). There are the usual jokes, plus the chaos of Spike Jones and his orchestra. In addition, comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and Hugh O'Brien.
