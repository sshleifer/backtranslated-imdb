The MISSOURI GIRL comes to New York knowing exactly what she wants: to add something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her good-looking knockout, she quickly catches the eye of the playboy, the son of a tycoon, but remaining faithful to her virtue, she will also discover true love. <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow vibrates in this excellent comedy. With her platinum hair and beautiful paraphernalia, she's a gorgeous. But her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress. She deservedly earned her place at the top of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast gives Harlow good support: Lionel Barrymore as the cunning old tycoon, wise in Harlow's ways; Belo Franchot Tone as his son, in love with love; Patsy Kelly shrieked, stealing his scenes as Harlow's helper; debonair Alan Mowbray, as a well-educated English Lord; the elderly Clara Blandick as resolute secretary of Barrymore; the warm Hale Hamilton as a wealthy man with an eye for women; Muscled Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard catching Kelly's flirting eye; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced soon after the institution of the Hollywood Production Code. A comparison with RED HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which the character of Harlow follows the same ends, but uses very different means.
