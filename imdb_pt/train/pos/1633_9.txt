I loved this movie when it came out in the 80's and still does! I still quote classic lines like "say it again" and "you said that I would rip my balls from you". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was underestimated and repudiated by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be my treasure and a movie that I would take with me if I were sent to a desert island! I just wanted someone to release the DVD because my VHS tape is worn! If you like comedies full of fun, this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It's military humor is better and worse! Rent it if you can not own it!
