That would have been a lot of fun to watch in a theater in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste that really enjoys shockingly well made movies. <br /> <br /> "The dentist" is sometimes panned, probably because people usually have strong feelings about dental issues. Perhaps the ADA has launched a campaign against it, since dentists report that they need to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only one scene comparable to many in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was filmed in 21 days. Of course, post-production may take longer than filming, and the issue of "The Dentist" is perfect. The quick cuts increase so much tension that in the scene where the Dentist "looks after" his wife, there are only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role, since he has much experience in interpreting characters psychologically "out" and completely sold the obsessive-compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the rhythm of the movie was just right. Filmmakers reveal their wife's malice in the right way. All the characters in the dental office look like real people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension while they are dealing with impatient people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is on the verge of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very very tight. All victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways. Two types of law enforcement even involve themselves in a small subplot that ends up creating a confrontational clash near the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the dental phobia, but a real roller coaster. and strongly recommended for fans of smart gorefests.
