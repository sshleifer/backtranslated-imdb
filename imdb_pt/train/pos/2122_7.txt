Back in the days of the big studios system, the most vicious decisions were made. Good old American all-American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. If I had released the film, Kralik's part would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problems in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was her most frequent protagonist on the screen, he made four films with her. But it is only this in which none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda at the time. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable managed to become an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all other players were also American, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart then you will see a great Ernest Lubitsch movie. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest do not get along in person. But it seems that they are keeping a correspondence with some anonymous admirers who end up being one to the other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects that Stewart mistakenly got involved with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the leaders are well and Frank Morgan gets away from the usual confused me, the two players who do best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he takes off after Morgan starts asking for opinions from people. It becomes very scarce. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is great as the little worm that is constantly kissing on Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I know many like Schildkraut in real life who are in office politics 24 hours a day. It's sad that this makes up for most of the time.
