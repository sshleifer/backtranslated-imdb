This movie has one of the most cheesy plots I've ever seen. For me, that's what makes it so incredible! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they have achieved in the original Munsters series. Although there was less clowning, they still worked wonderfully together "comedically." I wanted Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, to be more involved with the plot. She showed that she could do comedy in the original series, but was mostly wasted in this movie. This movie is also starring the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think a better job could have resulted from this.
