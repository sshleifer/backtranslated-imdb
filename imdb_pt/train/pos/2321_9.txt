Here's the kind of love story I like to watch. And mainly, it is for two reasons. One, focus on young, VERY young. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. We've all been there in our lives and "The Man on the Moon" is a magnificent reflection on our memories, perhaps adding more details and enhancing them more than any of us have ever experienced. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I believe that, as teenagers, it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters may be really in love or that they are so new to love that they just believe strongly that they are and after a tragedy happens they will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man on the Moon" is full of talented big names. It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing the harsh district attorneys as well as the strict but careful and wise parents as in this movie. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young and young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young and talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think about ten years down the road she will win the Oscars. All cast members perform great performances and, with convincing script dialogue, are enhanced to look like real people in real situations. As if everything really happened. This is the kind of movie I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I would love to see movies that make everything look real and is not fake or unbelievable in any way.
