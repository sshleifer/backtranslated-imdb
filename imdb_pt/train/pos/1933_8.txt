This indie movie looks at the lives of a group of people attending an adult swimming lesson in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. What drives the film are the characters, excellently played by mostly unknown actors. The highlights of the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher who experiences marital problems and Weixler as a casino marketer who works as a stripper. Both actresses have natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive cinematic debut for writer Schechter and filmmaker Setton. The latter keeps the narrative moving in a fast clip. The title and the poster of the film suggest something cheeky, but this is a wonderful comedy drama.
