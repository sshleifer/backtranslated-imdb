Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced. Humanity has made a number of technological advances, but is humanity mature enough to handle its new toys? There is moral decay in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on BSG's background) that there will be a problem with Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are all the other problems that we humans bring to ourselves. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least not to the extent that humanity is fleeing from a relentless problem that was ultimately of its own creation. There are not many special effects based on photos or space - at least not in the first few episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> What he has are very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performances by the actors. They can make a culture that is similar to modern but alien society while being completely believable. Like BSG, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentialities and failures. It may seem a bit strange that a human society in a different set of worlds has neckties, vintage cars and chicken. But these things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone who gets stuck in these details is really missing the point. Whether you are from a mafia-style culture or a rich, high-tech culture, human beings and human nature are not as different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past as we see in the world today. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
