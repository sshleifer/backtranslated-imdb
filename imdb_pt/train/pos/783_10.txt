The first word that comes into my mind after watching this movie is "beauty." Beauty is everywhere, in the actors' play (Andie is superb as always), in well-designed photos, and in the red line idea of ​​the authors - Love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in the life of these three otherwise boring and predictable women. His interaction makes Andie's character live as fun as it could be. When it is gone, it has become obvious that we can not really appreciate and maintain our inner beliefs and our sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie recovers from this loss is not bad at all, but it shows that life prevails anyway, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it's so British in every way - everything houses and "fags" and accents :))). And Andie is doing a great job again! It's a pity that this movie has such low ratings. 10th of Dec!
