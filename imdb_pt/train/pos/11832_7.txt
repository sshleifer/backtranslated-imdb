Time for rhetorical speech, huh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there have been some things that prevent me from rating it above 6 or 7 (I'm being a little generous with 7). <br /> <br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon aggravates me. I was thinking, 'What an idiot voice they called the main character,' when I first heard him narrate - and then I realized it was Matt Damon. The man bothers me a lot - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the film for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin it, but that's another story for another time), as it almost happened "Spirit." I was able to get through this fact because of the little narration there was actually ... fortunately. <br /> <br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams sucks ... The whole score was terrible ... The songs were not original, generic and poorly executed; I never found the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the thigh songs appeared, I was off. I almost thought I'd start listening to some patriotic propaganda slipping into the lyrics of the American super-freedom style (I could not help but remember those awful patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11). In light of the Native American aspects of the movie, they should have gone with the montage of music using certain instruments, no crap radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap. I thought I was back in high school. I can not believe that anything better could have been done - I refuse. If it were not for that, I would rate the movie more with Disney, who knows a thing or two about originality (okay, do not bother to say what I know some of you are probably thinking;). Too bad, it's a shame they did not hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked art and animation, except for a few things here and there ... as sometimes the angles look very sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines mostly near the end). Many times I thought they had tried too hard on emotions and facial expressions and could not draw any real emotion. But there were also times when the excitement grew thick. Anyway, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm sleeping here, so I'll summarize it before I start to make less sense ... <br /> <br /> Good attempt at an epic movie ... turned out to be mediocre though. Matt Damon, you suck!
