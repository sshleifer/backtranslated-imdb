That deserves a 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show needs to come back, I've seen all the episodes and this is of real quality. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a couple of New Yorkers, plays with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are awesome, as is the lovely Caseman. The setting is amazing and the wardrobes are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more programs like this that make viewers feel they are smart people, not irrational drones. <br /> <br /> If he ever comes back, six degrees will be very much felt.
