No, this should not be a high-budget glow, but it's brilliant by itself. you have to look at it for what it is, a low-budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12-inch love stick that he keeps off hitting. those who came to give this film a low criticism were probably looking for the next classic cult or hidden gem as they say and simply did not get there. I love how everyone points out obvious observations, like the "5-cent baby stuck to a fish pole" hahaha, well, yes. I do not think a movie with such a budget could allow actors or "good" effects, so they worked with what they had. the bowels and guts were really very convincing. the film was somewhat unstable moving from sequence to sequence, but overall, this is one of the best movies I've seen lately that does not follow any trend or predictability. very good for laughing.
