Some of these guys who watch movies and complain about life are forgetting something: the DVD menu system. I tell you people, I watched the main screen repeat in this about 35 times. It was amazing. A cinematographic tapestry of cascading glow that made me from where I was, which was the beginning. Often the sum and Bam! He was in prison. Again and again and again. And more. <br /> <br /> "Doot of doot, do of dodedo". And that's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I'm laid on the bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is on the flat roof and this soft evening is again soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that crosses in me is already rested. I put the DVD. I was hypnotized. By night. "doot doot, dood do." <br /> <br /> The Blob. Look. Steve Queen, two policemen and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
