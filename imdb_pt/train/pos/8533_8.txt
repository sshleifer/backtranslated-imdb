This movie is more Lupine than most, especially coming from Funimation. Others then the bad dub, not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very much like Comic (which is what all Lupine the third material is based on). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko is using Lupine's weakness for women to try to take some of it out. The last bit is not so bad, he's with other women, but of course Fujiko is still number one. <br /> <br /> Many of Lupine's other films are more familiar, with bad words, then Lupine. Any good Lupine fan, I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie). It may be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they get a little softer), but overall, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few to watch Lupine III again.
