In the Strings Attached presents Carlos Mencia doing stand-up that makes us laugh and think. He not only mocks racial issues (as many complain), but also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they want to be treated equally ... why Americans are more crazy than the Arab terrorists ... why no one needs to pray for the Pope - and what he hopes he's doing in heaven ... a theory of how the Easter traditions (aka Big Ups for Jesus' Day) began. ... the film's Passion of Christ - and its subsequent argument with a woman about whether it is affected by Jesus ... how society should treat the physically disabled ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or do not. <br /> <br /> In addition, it never fails to remind us that each of us has a voice. Therefore, we should use it to speak the truth, to say what we think and not to be afraid of others being offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
