There are few movies or movies that I consider favorites over the years. The way of the Gospel was one of them. I watched this as a young teenager and would like to have the opportunity to watch again. My favorite part was the fact that 1 / Jesus was blonde, <br /> <br /> 2 / the last supper was a big meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he liked to play with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> The film may not have been theologically correct or high quality, but it touched my heart at that time. Plus I'm a fan of Johnny Cash and it was a brave undertaking. If I ever go out on DVD, I'll buy it for purely sentimental reasons.
