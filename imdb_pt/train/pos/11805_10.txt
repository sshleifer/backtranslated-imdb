Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's List was excellent. A great watch for children and adults of all genres. Large noses can be seen as hinting at phallic symbols, in the same way that H. R. Puff N Stuff suggested marijuana smoking. Your kids will love this movie. I liked it very much as a child. My father showed me this movie as a kid. He also liked and pointed out that exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although at the time I had no idea what they were. The film is comedy and adventure. The plot is crazy and cheerful. You and I will enjoy it together.
