Jim Henson's Muppets were my favorites since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway at a music show somewhere else, but in New York. You'll see special appearances from then-Mayor of New York, Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 years this year and I hope today's children will learn to appreciate the nonchalance of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit disappears and the gang has to meet him in New York. It pays to watch children and even sentimental adults like me.
