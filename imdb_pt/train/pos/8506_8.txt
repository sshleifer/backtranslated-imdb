. . . but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very diffused. I really would like to be the owner of the movie, since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I'm a bus driver and by the time I saw this movie, I was driving that model bus. It was only (during his murder trial, about 15 years later) that I vaguely remember that OJ was one of the stars in it. I just remember that he was the driver and bus that was being shot down and driven wildly. I've been looking around for this whole unsuccessful movie since I saw it in the mid 80's. I liked the movie, I do not usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide, and seeing its beginning (though fuzzy ) I stayed for the whole thing.
