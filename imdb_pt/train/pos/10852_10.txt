Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still a crazy-holic. It was just another movie I watched partly on TV. So I had to get the videotape to finally find out how it ends. So I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed early signs of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to get my hands on the soundtrack. Then on various movie posters and the movie script. At the time, it became even worse that I tried to push other people into addiction with my site and with Still Crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What led me to addiction? <br /> <br /> OK, it's one of those funny, but somehow sad and melancholic comedies, as only the English can produce. All right, the movie is a world apart from things like "This Is Spinal Tap," because of the characters, who are not childish or super cool, but real. This is a story about aging men as well. A story about men getting along. Or not. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, which makes one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is unbelievable. Mick Jones of Foreigner wrote the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bassist Les Wickes, and Bill Nighy, who plays the egocentric but awkward vocalist Ray Simms, are actually singing. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you've only heard Bill Nighy sing in "Love Actually," you have no idea how big and powerful your voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will have fever for all the scenes that will come at x-th hour, especially those scenes of shows. You'd die to really be in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing "All Over The World," singing at the top of their lungs. You want to weep and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit on the stage of the festival of Wisbech. <br /> <br /> It's difficult, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is a world where this band really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> You're still crazy ... anyone?
