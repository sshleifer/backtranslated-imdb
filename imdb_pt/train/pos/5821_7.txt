I was quite surprised to read some of the reviews on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a plot ??? Okay, when this video came out more than a decade ago, I watched what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It does not have a plot or a central plot. It's a pretty artistic anthology, mostly long videos, all done cleverly and creatively. Michael Jackson may be considered a freak these days but, after all, this was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many the best music video ever) and established trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker , he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took their music and dance moves to create vividly entertaining things, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance scenes and even self-parody (the "Badder" sequel) . . And for those who wonder what Joe Pesci was doing there, this video came out just before it became a household name, and was one of his most memorable movie appearances. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequel (the choreographed section) beats anything else Michael Jackson did up to that point!
