This joint work on adults returning to the summer camp of their youth was a keen participant and cinematographer in the fall of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but again, some of the best films are quiet releases that do not get much praise or compliments. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (which is painfully good here) are the group of actors playing these roles like people who have aged with good, bad and funny memories from past summers. This film covers the misfortune of mostly pleasant emotions, and the film never botheres the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling, preferring to allow the viewer to enter into memory on their own. As I am a moviegoer who frankly stirs up blatant manipulation in the movies, this is something I appreciate from screenwriter and director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great cheap rental, a good rental and even a beautiful sit in a theater movie. You may come across this on TV, and I would definitely suggest a look.
