I thought this movie was hysterical. I've watched it many times and highly recommend it. Mel Brooks, was excellent. The cast was fantastic .. I do not understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating. I loved it .. I've seen other movies of him and they were funny too, but this one actually stayed on my mind because of the humor .. His I just can not say enough about this movie. I try to make it periodically, but never enough for me. The people who played homeless compared to the funniest standards as well. Please put this movie more often. I can not see enough..Leslie Ann Warren was also another of my favorites, since Cinderella. I always thought she was not very funny, but she loved her acting. In this movie she was very funny ... and she and Mel did a great job together. They should put more movies on TV.
