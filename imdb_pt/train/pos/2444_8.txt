"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I have not seen all the episodes, but I still like it. There are many episodes that I liked. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) got into a moving piece of machines. If you want to know why, you will have to have seen it for yourself. Before concluding, I would like to say that everyone always performed well, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even if new episodes can be seen today, I strongly recommend that you see it just in case it leaves the air forever.
