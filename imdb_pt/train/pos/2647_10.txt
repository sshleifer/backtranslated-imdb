This film can be interpreted on many different levels. Do not listen to the other comments that attack the movie and say it's a story or something new and it's just about drugs. It has superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and because I think it was done in person) really is not about that. It is really mocking the psychology and conditioning of society. It shows, for a fraction of a second, that the main character's brother is watching these videos online. Because? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all this horrendous thing we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanics in our professions, instead of seeing people as people. As for the logic scene, it is also catching up with people in the 1% intelligent classes ordered by the federal government who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it sounds on a macroscopic level. You have to apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and to leave room to change your plans and adjust yourself along the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. This may be well above your head; it's not for you, it's for those people who are having trouble dealing with life, not exercising as a math problem. When you're critically analyzing a movie or writing your reviews, try not reading the back cover first (written by marketing professionals and parapsychologists)
