I miss the Angel of Darkness! ... <br /> <br /> I understand that neither one likes this, but, as far as I am concerned, the show should not have been canceled, especially for another simulated space program ... < I'm reading the books now. they're doing a good job of explaining some things, but I still think we should make a TV movie or something. <br /> <br /> FREAK'S NATION LIVES !!!!!!!!
