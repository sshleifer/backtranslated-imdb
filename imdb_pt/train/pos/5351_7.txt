Although this movie is a little stuffed with eighty cheese I have a place for it in my DVD rack and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is 'television is rubbish, so turn it off and go get a life'. For those of you who decide to listen to the message, then you should try to read the book, it's nothing like the movie. To ruin it for you at the end of the story, a fatally injured Richards ends up colliding with a plane in the network building, killing himself, all in and turning off the network at the same time. I read that many years ago, but today it would be difficult not to compare it to September 11th.
