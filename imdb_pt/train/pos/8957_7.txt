I did not see this movie from 1958 in a long time and I really enjoyed Kim Novak playing Gil Holroyd who is a real witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a wizard brother named Nick played by Jack Lemmon When Gillian sets eyes on Shep Henderson, (James Stewart) who is engaged to a girl, he is getting married; Gillian performs some magical spells with a cat and changes his mind about his bride and then becomes very lust and falls in love with Gillian. The story goes that a real witch can not fall in love, blush or cry, and this becomes a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they had to do something about it. Great film to see more and more and a great classic film of 1958.
