This is not a criticism of the film, but a comment about how blind we are to our own past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel - except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to the Winter Soldier because of its one-sided message, both films illustrate how we hasten to engage in false-based conflicts, and allow our young and courageous (and often naive) youngsters to bear the brunt of such greedy war speculation. Both films effectively show that mentality forced on young minds and willing to make them efficient killing machines but the training is insufficient to teach the diplomatic and police skills needed to effectively conquer the hearts and minds of the people who supposedly fighting for . Ultimately, this is what lost the war in Vietnam and will probably also lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so unilateral that it can easily be passed on as propaganda on the left. Not by me, remember, but by those who intend to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view would speak to a larger audience.
