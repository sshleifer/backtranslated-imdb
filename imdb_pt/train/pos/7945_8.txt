I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can get a plot and put the animals as the main actors, you'll usually get me. Homeward Bound did just that. They picked up a plot that was as old as time and gave it a new spin. It was a complete success. It's much more of an archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group (shadow) that is wise and logical, you have the kind but brash and suspicious Chance, and the princess who thinks she should be spoiled and praised. These three personalities differ very well. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not win. Most people say it can not be good because it's too much of a children's movie. What they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a children's movie, and this still does not take the actual movie. This is a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without the cartoons, a movie with a better plot. I undoubtedly advise you to watch.
