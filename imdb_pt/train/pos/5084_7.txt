I was surprised, that '' The Secret Fury '' was a nice nice film ... Probably because, I had no expectations for this movie ..... However, the film has its holes in the plot. ..... I would say, you could not guess who was behind the whole scheme, by the end of the movie ..... At first, I thought, it was Robert Ryan, using the same method as "Gaslight "where the husband tries to drive his wife crazy, but I was wrong ... The main problem with the film is that they drive in another direction, which did not give clues in the beginning. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert carried their parts well ...... Also, Vivian Vance, a great character actress who steals scenes in this ... Those who like movies, who guess what, you'll like this ......
