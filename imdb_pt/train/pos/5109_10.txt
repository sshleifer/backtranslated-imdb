I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result, I do not remember anything about the movie. But I remember the feeling it caused in Gilley and Johnny Lee's mechanical bull, "Lookin 'for Love," which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I listen. <br /> <br /> However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is that I was impressed. Few movies hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's farm, the Texas City chemical plant, Gilley's dance hall, Bud and Sissy. And perhaps for this reason it does not have a wider appeal. But no matter what you think of country music (I can not stand it, despite my roots in Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. That's why I love it!
