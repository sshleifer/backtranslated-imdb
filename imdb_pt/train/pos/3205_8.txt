I saw this in the theater and I immediately thought it was good enough to own on video. I'm crazy about Sci-Fi action movies anyway. <br /> <br /> Without giving any of the story, it's worth seeing if you like science fiction without requiring much thought. The story is basic and the plot is very good. Well worth your time to see! <br /> <br /> Maybe they'll follow up? :) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
