This was Keaton's first feature film and is actually three shorts, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Era, Modern Era) in the eternal triangle of the novel. The stories are parallel, as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which was intended to satirize. The strengths of jokes and gags almost all depend on anachronisms, bringing modern business in ancient settings. <br /> <br /> **** ATTENTION - SPOILERS FUCK TO MAKE THE BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using a turtle like a tiny board (Stone Age); A wristwatch containing a sun dial (Roman Era); A carriage with a spare wheel (Roman Era); Wearing a helmet like a tire lock (Roman Era); Early golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); Dictating a will being carved on a rock (Stone Age); The changing weather forecast (Roman Age); The car race in the snow -Buster wearing skis and huskies with a spare dog in the boot of the carriage (Roman Era). <br /> <br /> The above scenes are all things that make us laugh. There are unforgettable moments, however: <br /> <br /> Buster pulling out the shaving equipment to match the girl who does makeup; The fantastic double when a drunken Buster looks at his plate to find a crab looking at him (within a second he jumped to stand in his chair from a sitting position and jumped back into the waiter's arms - one of the funniest moments I I already saw). And that lion - the manicure - just brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of racism when four African American flags abandon their mistress for a game of Roman crap. <br /> <br /> Kino's impression is somewhat distorted and contains numerous sequences of nitrate deterioration and film damage - probably at the ends of the coils. The subway facility is marked with piano and flute and is borrowed from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Fun and full of laughter.
