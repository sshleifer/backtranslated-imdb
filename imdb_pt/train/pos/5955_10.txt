As the creator of "This Darkness", I admit that we neglected 3 very important recognitions on our final credits. The omissions were views that could not be corrected once committed, nor did the parties involved - who saw the film - mention that at the time. On behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film, I extend an apology. Obviously, some of the criticisms posted here are harsh in the light of your credit being accidentally. Our production values ​​were insignificant and our "special effects" were really very special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod's cinematography is superb. We hope you, the reader, enjoy "This Darkness" and the efforts of those who have worked for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, director.
