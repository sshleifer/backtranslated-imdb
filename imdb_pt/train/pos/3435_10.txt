This movie is a wonderfully simplistic work. Pleasant from beginning to end, it is both sad and uplifting. The performances of Miranda Otto (ah, as she deserves much more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and almost painful to watch, as the two tortured souls come to understand each other. The supporting cast of the Dead Card Office workers is wonderful in themselves, as well as Alice's suffering boyfriend, who I could not help but feel a little sorry for. There is a particular scene that I could watch over and over again (and I have!), It's a shame that movies like these are not recognized, and therefore attract them more in the eyes of the public so that more people can enjoy. I cried, I laughed and sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
