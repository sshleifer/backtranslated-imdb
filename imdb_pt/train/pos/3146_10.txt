If the TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to the TV after dinner. With the constant changing of relationships and discovering who is the true father of Hyde, this show was a success when it began in August 98, although it was set in 1976. And getting out in the basement of Foremans was always the thing to do back then, and it is still today, along with circles. This show gave great laughs in premieres, and still happens during the reruns. If you watch a few episodes of this show, you'll have it all and want more. Now it's only this show one of the best ever created, it's smart and funny.
