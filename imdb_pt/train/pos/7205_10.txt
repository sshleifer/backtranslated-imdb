Deathtrap is not a whodunit. It's who's going to do this to whoever first. It's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything, so I will not mention anything else about the plot. As for acting, it is the most important role of Cris Reeves as Clifford, a young playwrite. You really see the scope in your acting skills in this movie of "exhaling cheeseburgers" for absolutely scary. Clifford is such a difficult role to play and in stage production I have never seen Clifford play well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor interprets it as a puppy or homicidal maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen who has the right character all the time. As for Michael Caine, he's ..... well, he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this movie as good as it already was.
