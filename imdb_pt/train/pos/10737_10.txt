If I did not know better, it almost looks like it was staged, but it was not. It was set up perfectly, and how they got all these pictures is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well together in this documentary and the classic images that have made this an unfortunate classic. Only the story in the filming, by itself, should make it unmissable for any American or person affected by the tragedy of September 11.
