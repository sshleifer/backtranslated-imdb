Get ready for it: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am relatively unaware of the other works of David Mamet (writer and director), but after having watched this movie half a dozen times (it is always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is extremely well written, and it quickly draws you into its environment of fraud, con art and confusion behind the scenes. The sensation of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and is also a homage to the film noir. <br /> <br /> It's a psychologically complex film and it will definitely make you think of the various twists and motifs of the dark characters. It's a bit predictable at times, but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. Generally, the acting is superb - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone who watched the movie commented to me that it is not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a player, a smoker and a thief, but also sports a bad 80's hairstyle. I agree, but I think she's nevertheless noteworthy on paper. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better, as well as Mamet's latest movie, The Spanish Prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride through a movie that comes dangerously close to the glow.
