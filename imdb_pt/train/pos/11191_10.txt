This frightening and rather bloody adaptation of Stephen King's great novel features excellent central performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some gruesome effects. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style, and manages to make this one of the few versions of King's work that is not just worth seeing but genuinely unnerving. The representation of the zombie child Gage (Miko Hughes - later in "New Nightmare") is equally noteworthy, as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and frightening. As for people, they think that this it's scary-watch it alone in the dark (eventually with your reticent girlfriend) and I guarantee that "Pet Sematary" will crawl Some horror movies like this or "The Chainsaw Massacre" should not be seen as a group. It is recommended for horror fans!
