One of the best director Miike Takashi. It's so good that it's hard to put into words. Almost fifteen years older than the target audience, it thrilled me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It resembles similar childhood films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) these films were not afraid to scare - There are a lot of nasty details here that I initially found shocking, but I soon realized that it's nothing different from what I grew up with. The movie is a compilation of 1980s children's movie conventions. You name it, there it is: a young boy hero driven from his own unhappy / dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a downfall; a sadistic woman (Go-Go Yubari of Kill Bill Vol. 1); a villain who draws his evil power from something that everyone in the world can relate to. But all these gender conventions receive a new twist and additional depth. <br /> <br /> One of IMDb's reviews starts "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" and it's a feeling that I wholeheartedly agree with. Even as I watched, I lamented the fact that I had not grown in him; which was not part of my childhood as Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and, to a much lesser extent, The Neverending Story. These films, and others like The Goonies, are remembered but never copied - Miike tirelessly offers us a new view of things. Poor CGI is a milestone in many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints, but only as often an artistic choice - a desire to present things in a strange way. Here, the CGI is mostly average, just because of budget constraints, but nonetheless it does a fantastic job of making a spectacle. The effects of CG combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and a truly extraordinary makeup to create a world full of rich characters (and characterization) that is often confused with the visionary. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest children's characters. movies already made. Not for younger or more sensitive children, however. <br /> <br /> Just drop your wonderful chin. See for yourself and if you think your kids can handle them, show them. Let them grow in the Great Yokai War as a small compensation for the fact that you can not.
