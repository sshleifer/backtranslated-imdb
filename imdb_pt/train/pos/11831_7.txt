Despite the dazzling and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the most inspiring Disney movies I have ever seen, and I do not play Disney movies very often. The spirit is a wild stallion that is repeatedly captured, either by the cavalry or the Indians, who try to "break it". The spirit ends up forming a connection with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is history. Except for the beautiful animation of the horses, neither me nor my five years old were very inspired or animated with this film. It's ironic that it's titled "Spirit", since Spirit is what this movie could have used a little more. An extra point was given to the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is rated G, you probably have to end up explaining what "breaking a horse" means for your five year old. I made. <br /> <br />
