A young and seemingly promising college student (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young woman and is placed on the death row. Sean Connery plays the "happy and lucky" lawyer who the young man's grandmother discovers after retirement and asks to take up the case hoping to free his grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is committed to unraveling a theory that Connery can unearth to try to free the boy he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Late Lynne Thigpen co-star in this very intense dramatic thriller.
