That's right. The movie is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But the film is so much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I have not seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about it in my commentary on the miniseries. But I missed some. The film is filmed in a better location than where the mini-series was filmed. And the REDRUM scenes are more frightening than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
