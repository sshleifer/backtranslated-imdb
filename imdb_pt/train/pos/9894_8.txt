"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous slasher about a school nerd, Marty, who gets caught up all the time by some pranksters. The joke goes awry and he ends up being wildly burned. Five years later, all his tormentors participate in a reunion. only the ten of them is clear, and low and behold, Marty kills them one after another. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as the heroine (who dies anyway!). The acting is completely horrible, there is also no suspense at all. Many grotesque death scenes to satisfy the freaks: a guy's stomach explodes, another female victim literally takes a sour bath, a couple having sex in bed is electrocuted, a guy is crushed by a tractor, a girl is drowned , and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye. The killer uses a decent and rather frightening silly silly mask and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really nice.All the end of the dream is totally pathetic.Among it is Truth that "Slaughter High" is a piece of crap, but I liked it. Just for fans of real horror movies.
