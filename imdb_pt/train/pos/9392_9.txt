I got home late at night and turned on the TV, to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their choices of the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West" except two thumbs up and see before you leave. He would not spend much time in theaters because of the distributor's financial problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon, I followed their advice. They were right, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever had. As some readers point out, there are some holes in the plot and the last 10 minutes seem to never end. But worth it, for the good craftsmanship that came in the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems perfectly scaled up. Dennis Hopper is almost on top, which is ridiculous, but reinforces how much everything else works. Sets and music contribute a lot to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I rented it later for my family, it did not work so well. The long scenes that built the tension in the theater were hard to appreciate, with the distractions at home. It deserves all your attention; turn off the phone, make sure not to be disturbed, watch and listen to all the scenes, especially in the beginning.
