I've been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since Phenomena, and after hearing about seven minutes in the sky, I saw her as soon as I could. The film is not just a comedy if you think that many of these things that most of us went through as kids and are currently going on not only was the fantastic movie driven by the phenomenally jennifer connelly as it captivated my attention that this movie was terribly written and acted out it was a good deal I loved it and watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you can not postpone seeing this movie !!!!
