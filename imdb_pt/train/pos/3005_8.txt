This is still the point of reference for judging all whodunnits of the Golden Age, and given the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on-screen), it bears all generations of similar attempts, from the movies and TV . Fast and furious with many wipes from Warner Bros, and fortunately there is no time for a love interest, galloping, taking the splendid cast to the violent end. I never understood why the prosecutor had to track Vance everywhere, I always found that they were connected. Palette as the detective, but especially Girardot as the doctor, is deliciously eccentric and non-PC - looking at the second murder victim, he smells that there were many people in the world anyway. Of course it's William Powell, like Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director), who makes the movie what it is - when Powell went mad? <br /> <br /> The police army at the crime scene did not. It really does a very good job of finding the second corpse and the unconscious dog! The best part is where Vance tells us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders - cluttered models combine with fantastic camera angles to produce a very modern feel, and surprising with what happened before. The only problem is that, as usual, the conclusion can not coincide with the general deductive processes exhibited along and a somewhat artificial end is invoked; some Chan's, Moto's and many others, of course, could only be completed this way too. But because it happens so fast and it's ... a little doubtful morally, it does not lessen my opinion about KMC's status as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the impressions I've seen of KMC are (at worst) like looking at an aquarium, so if you're interested in watching it hold on until it's sucked.
