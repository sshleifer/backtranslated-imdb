OK, this movie starts as a long-running movie and does not improve until the end of the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff' and the cast is not well-directed most of the time. In the first half of the movie, the little girl pissed me off. I do not think this is one of your best acting jobs. The only reason I bought the film is because it was for sale and had Ellen Burstyn. She is great, but neither is one of her best performances. The story is based on actual events and this helps the movie. In fact, I did not even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when I saw pictures of the traveling balloon, I mean ... get to where you're supposed to go and end it! But everything is forgiven when it reaches its destination and the story comes to an end. If this does not bring a tear to your eye, it will not be! It is tacky and predictable, but it also makes you feel good about the world again.
