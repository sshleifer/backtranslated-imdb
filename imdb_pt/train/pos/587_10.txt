One of the things about the film that warmed the chords of my heart was that dry fly fishing was an important part of the scene. I have occasionally accomplished my dry fly fishing times, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spent a day in a river or other looking to try the always elusive Brown Trout to get up and catch the fly . which we were offered. <br /> <br /> When we had occasions like this, any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world dissolved to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in activity and in the world. wherever we were. <br /> <br /> This was one of the incredible things that was pictured for me in the film when the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed the ritual. For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing, since there is something ritualistic about so many hobbies. You can not just start pitching your fishing line and waiting for the best. You have to tune in to where you are, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best spot can be to place your fly and depending on your skill level you can even get the his fly to land long enough for a fish to take note of it and attack. The 'fly fishing art' has been directed and performed so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the film could not be more appropriately chosen because the river actually ran through the life of father and two children. However, this film spreads more than the family and community in Montana, on the Blackfoot River, where the film is shown. It has the ability to draw it, to conquer it, to capture it, as the history of the family, the community and the period unfolds. The story told is not just a family story, but a life story. What can be classified as a "river of life"
