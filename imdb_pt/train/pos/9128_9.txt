I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke limits, established a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I still play on the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the movie itself, I just meant what I said in the title, because for the movie For the most part, this movie itself is made by music. The acting? Please do not let me judge this, since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know I was not worthy of Oscar by any means. But I think the duo that got this movie was Morris and Jarome, their passwords talk was a bit beyond hilarious. I just want to rate this movie in the sequences of shows because I felt that was what made the film. <br /> <br /> Prince is a musical genius and has created beautiful music. While the film and acting are very bad, this movie is still fun to watch at night and even dance. This movie defined the 80s, so just enjoy it. The prince would want it just to celebrate! Oh boy, that sounded lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
