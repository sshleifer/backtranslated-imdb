I used to love watching "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of TGIF's best shows. My friends and I used to get together every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was adorable and so funny. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend, Harvey. It was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a good teenage witch too. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Overall I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC will bring it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
