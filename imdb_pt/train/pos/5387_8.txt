Even in the 21st century, pregnancy is dangerous: women have abortions and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the ward of "difficult cases" of a motherhood. Loretta Young plays the leading role, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not pertinent to the plot) to give birth; She is in conflict over the fact that she will have to give the baby after birth. She is in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the protagonist, the excellent performance, as always, is put by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner B's women in the 1930s, appearing prominently in supporting roles, and sometimes taking the lead in B movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in various parts of the "Torchy" B movie series). Farrell plays an expectant mother who does not want her children, because they only hinder. She does everything she can to disrupt nurses, including smuggling alcohol into the ward (this, of course, during the dry days) and drinking like a fish - apparently they've never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome in the past. 30s. <br /> <br /> Curiously, unlike most early 1930s films, it is not women being foolish fumbling with heroic men - this is the reverse, with expectant parents being heaps of jelly. (Watch veteran actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "Life Begins", being one of the first speakers, treats the subject with a lot of melodrama, for sure, but it's a very charming film. Turner Classic shows him, though infrequently; I just saw this show up in a few days honoring Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to see when it appears.
