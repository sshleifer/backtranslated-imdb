"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the main early episodes of "Columbo" that helped define the program for the next thirty years. He marks the first of four appearances by Robert Culp (three as a killer), playing the same role in each show. In this case, Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large detective firm has asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Kennicut, is having an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, hoping that he can blackmail his wife in exchange for fragments of information about her husband's business associates. She reacts badly to this suggestion, a discussion that quickly turns violent when Brimmer hits her face. Because he is wearing a large ring, the blow knocks him down and kills him. <br /> <br /> There are some really invaluable moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be reading his hands, though this is in fact a device to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring. Columbus being Columbus, he only reveals what he really knows when the time is right to tighten the screws a little. So he plays the role of a rather simple-minded man who gets carried away with the "lifeline that goes over the moonlit," or some ridiculous mumbo-jumbo to read his hands. <br /> <br /> A great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his company, effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose. Again, Columbus does not reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honored and excited about this job offer. <br /> And there's another one where Columbus tells Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that he wants the killer to hear his talk. He wants to suggest to Brimmer that he is about him without directly accusing him, so he, cruelly (but understandable under the circumstances), decides to play mental games in Brimmer to scare him and do something stupid. Of course he does! All the while, the bereaved Kennicut does not know the subtext of this conversation. It is only near the end that Columbus explains everything to Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not reveal how Columbus finally spikes the killer bang, but let's just say there's a potato involved. .. <br /> <br /> A very good episode, possibly the best of the first series. If you liked that, you'll also enjoy "Double Exposure," also featuring Robert Culp.
