I could not believe the comments made about the movie. <br /> <br /> While reading the terrible opinions about the film, I really wondered if you had actually seen the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actresses and the director did a fantastic job on the film. <br /> <br /> I did not have the pleasure of seeing any of the actresses before and I could not have been more embarrassed by the incredible work they did. I would have to say that it is the most convincing film I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has a problem with Deanna's drug choice in attempting suicide scene, from the comments made it sound like it was the choice of the actresses and their stupid choice. That I do not understand, is a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else, so how can be the mistake of the actresses that I can not see. I think it was a really convincing film that I would see again and recommend. Opinions are what they are and it is very bad that so many are so close. I hope to see any of the actors soon, I think they all played a big role. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will be the highest paid actress one day and I hope she can laugh at everyone who criticized her! You go girl!
