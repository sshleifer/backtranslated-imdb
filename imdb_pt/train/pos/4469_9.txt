Usually musicals from the 1940s were of a definite formula - and if you studied films you know what I'm talking about - a certain duration, very "showy" performances that were great on the surface but never entered the realities of the cinema. characters etc. <br /> <br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and light years are better and worth its indication for the best photo of the year - 1945 (although there was no chance of defeating the eventual winner - Lost Weekend). Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - yes I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain." This is different. He really enters into his character of a sea wolf thinking (in the beginning) that "catching any girl while on leave" is nothing more than a lark. And if you had to come up with a "story" to get it - so be it - until. More or less like the man of the song when he gets "with his foot pinned to the door". The eventual hilarity of the film stems mainly from his attempt and his new friend (Sinatra) to make the "story" good to "get the girl" that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love. You'll have to see the movie to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are so many other elements of great film in this film, it is a story of a classic friend, nostalgic for a time when World War II was almost over (the war ended about one month after the release of the movies), the realization that a guy who always laughs at life may find that he really is a great human being, great music and probably some other elements of classic cinema that I can not think of right now. <br /> <br /> Why not a 10? Near the end - at almost 2 1/2 hours it starts to feel a bit long. There are a small number of ballets that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945, but it seems dated and seems like it only adds minutes now. But overall, this is a definite winner on all levels.
