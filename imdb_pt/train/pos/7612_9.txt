OK, I'll be honest, when I first saw the program trailer, I thought it was an advertisement for some sun screen product. With all the people walking on the beach. Despite this, I decided to watch it, thinking it would be some new spectacle that I could laugh at. But I was seriously astonished. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked, why he was lying in the trees, why the plane crashed etc. etc. <br /> <br /> It's not every day that a show comes along that combines intelligence, humor, action and suspense. But 'Lost' gets it all. With a great cast and crew, beautiful locations and very decent special effects, 'Lost' will catch anyone who tunes, and is a must-see for anyone who is tired of tacky comedies and bad reality shows. <br /> <br /> Lost is on Tuesdays at 10 on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
