Wow. I saw it last night and I'm still recovering from how good it was. Each character seemed so real (though most of them selfish and selfish holes) and the bizarre story - middle-aged widow starts fucking her daughter's irresponsible boyfriend - felt totally convincing. The best performances of all time except those of Anne Reid and Our Friends in the North, Daniel Craig (the latter appears as the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> What about director Roger Michell? This is as far away from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
