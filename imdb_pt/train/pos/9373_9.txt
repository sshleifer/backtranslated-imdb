Like many of you I'm a big fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir movies - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us who yearn for the past. The term 'neo-noir' has been so often misused in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserved to be described as such. The cast is perfect around and would have felt right at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you get hooked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated that. Many contemporary films leave me wondering why they do not do them like they used to, and I'm not that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future as they pay homage to the past.
