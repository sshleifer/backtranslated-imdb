Western deftly interesting from a director who had few pairs in the genre. Much like other Anthony Mann images, The Far Country combines a potent boiling story of marijuana with a deft knowledge of shocking landscapes. Both of which play among some of Mann's peccadilloes such as honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death! The story shows fortune hunter partners Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) traveling to the Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the flourishing of the gold boom, they plan to profit from the sale of cattle in a town of Klondike. Arriving in Skagway they find the self-appointed judge Mr. Gannon (John McIntire) ready to find justice for Webster because Webster has broken the law, all with honest cause, along the way. In punishment, Gannon takes the partners away from them, but they steal them back and cross the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men in pursuit. Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless city will fill the destinies of all involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from beginning to end, The Far Country benefits greatly from the bubbly hero of James Stewart in the portrait waiting, and Mann. Smooth direction of the tight script Borden Chase. The cinematography of William H. Daniels is superlative, although it has not been favored by the current prints on DVD, and the film has some surprises and a "will not it?" Paying dividends to re-watches for fans of the genre, it's still an essential vision for beginners to venture into the wonderful, yet dark, Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
