Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I actually watched. The story was totally surreal, but still great! What anyone who ranks and analyzes the movies should keep in mind is the purpose of the film. It's the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies - like this one - only aim at simple and comical nonsense. Such films can not be classified from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course these films do not have quality, do not have a sophisticated storyline, often do not have first-class acting, but if they meet their main premise - fine. I do not have this movie here on my all-time favorite list, but I still find it funny, I had very nice sequences and I made a good story. Brian Bonsall is an intelligent actor anyway.
