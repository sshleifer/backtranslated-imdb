I thought this move was very good. There were some things that were not perfect, but overall I was quite surprised. The court scene at the end seemed a bit unreal, but it was real enough to be fun. I discovered that the film communicated the difficulties of leaving with military training and the sacrifices that accompany it. Being a military pilot, I could relate to many of these parts.
