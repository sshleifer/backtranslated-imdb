Being from a small town in Illinois, I can relate instantly to this movie. Considering the era in which it was made, the town people seem uncomfortably with a lot of people I grew up with. Yes, the plot is like this. And yes, the performance will not be nominated for an Oscar soon. But that's not the point. The goal is to suspend reality and just have fun. And this movie has fun in abundance. From the ambitious and sloppy banker to the well-intentioned, but guessed adjunct, this film was made to mock the genre and the small town of SciFi who live at their best. Who can not smile at seeing the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I wanted to have one when I was growing up. Overall, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a pleasant joke in childhood, when you could sit on a Saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, and laugh at the weaknesses of life in the small town. This is a movie that I would watch again and again, if for no other reason than to mock me and my small towns.
