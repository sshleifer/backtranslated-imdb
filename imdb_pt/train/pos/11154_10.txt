In my opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made in America and it deserved every award it earned and it's the place on the AFI Top 100 list (although it's shamefully very low on IMDB's Top 250 list, only on # 183 as of this writing ). If you enjoy acting the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman are a great combination), well-designed characterizations and creative direction, editing and cinematography, you'll love it as much as I do. Schlesinger paints a vivid and ever-credible picture of the New York City scene in the late 1960s and there are many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amid the amorality, poverty, and hopelessness of 42nd Street, New York City. <br /> <br /> The production techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of New York's (and the city's) underground film movement and are nothing short of breathtaking. I've seen lots of ideas (including quick editing, handling of voice-over flashbacks, drug / travel sequences, and the caricatured face slipped during a murder scene to convey distress and terror) stolen by other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is treated so as to be seen as an extraordinarily strong friendship OR having its homosexual foundations. I think the director has dealt with this in a subtle way so as not to escape the censorship of the times, but rather to focus his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> <The MIDWIGHT COWBOY is a film of magnitude, influence and importance that has not lost any impact over the years, so if you have not seen it yet, you're missing out on a true American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
