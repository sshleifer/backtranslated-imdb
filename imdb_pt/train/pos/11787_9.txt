It's a short film by David Lynch with only 8 minutes, but it has all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, inconclusive, mysterious and strange; and before the blonde starts talking it's even a little scary! Is the soundtrack exceptional to create this strange environment because it is also sinister and mysterious? <br /> <br /> On the scenery itself, it does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but it has walls painted purple, which gives it an equally sinister effect. <br /> <br /> Plot is about a girl who is locked in a dark room and she asks for help; so comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's there just because of her ?? Do not we know what happened or what will happen next? finished unsolved and intriguing, as a good Lynch movie should end! <br /> <br /> It's a great short, despite some amateur acting. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short.
