A great movie, quite challenging than really fun. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you're leaving someone you loved, you have to say what I'm saying now: "Goodbye, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is ignoble. (I did not watch English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There are so many tactics involved in the relations between Alexander and the others, and yet everyone longs for a little more truth. However, knowing the truth may hurt even more, as Alexander experiences. The common interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of "liberated love," describing the undesirable implications on the people involved. This, in fact, shows this in a convincing way, but I would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a little more deeply: it is not that liberated love is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work in itself and try to overcome the dominant morality before and not through the practice of liberated love. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie is realistic and really worth watching.
