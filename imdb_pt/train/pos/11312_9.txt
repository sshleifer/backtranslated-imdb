Ossessione is in pretty bad shape, but is now undergoing a complete restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a "positive Master" 2nd generation originally from the impression that Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It was scanned into Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software. After that, the rest is manual labor and we do not expect to finish before the beginning of spring. At some point next year, it should be available on DVD and, hopefully, also released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come.
