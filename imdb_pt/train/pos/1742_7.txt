Perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I've seen in the last ten years .. excellent performances (especially yiannis zouganelis is great), well written script and effective direction of a very special, by very average Greek auteur standards. A film, obviously influenced by Straw Dogs, by Sam Peckinpah, which could be a masterpiece if it avoided some obvious and exaggerated situations and symbolizations in the end. However, this is a film that deserves our attention and belongs to this rare category of Greek films that should be seen outside of Greece. It is a pity that in Greece it has not worked commercially, in addition to other false and superficial productions like Politiki Kouzina.
