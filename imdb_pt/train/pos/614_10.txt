What a wonderful and fanciful movie "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I could easily end with this statement and suffice it to say that it can be accepted as a very strong recommendation to go see it. At a time when Hollywood seems inclined to force the remakes and sequels down, "Stardust" reminds us why we go to the movies - to get away from reality for a few hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike joy that we all yearn for. "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. It has the maiden in danger, the hero, the ladinos, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms and even a touch of speed of light to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from the city of Wall, which is conveniently situated next to a wall separating the city from a magical kingdom. The only way to cross the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by an old and sloppy encoder (interpreted wonderfully by David Kelly). One day, a young man from Wall, named Ben Barnes, maneuvers the old guard and backfires. He happens in an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a young (and very sexy) chained one called Una. She is held captive by a witch and tied by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is far away, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to the Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is summoned to the breech wall where the old guard gives him what you might expect - a boy. <br /> <br /> The boy, named Tristan, grows up to become a very unhappy young man (Charlie Cox) who is in love with a girl out of his league and also promised another. However, the young lady (named Victoria and Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love for her. After spying on a shooting star, she says he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and goes out on his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the realm of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. . He calls his remnant living children to tell them who will succeed him to the throne. His children's names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus, and Septimus. The other children were killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> Either way, he throws his ruby ​​spell in the sky and Voila, who brings the star to the earth. The star falls in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she, of course, is using the spell. But she does not know that she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the Princes, and also an old witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut off the hearts of the stars to regain her own youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds. Tristain is the first to find Yvaine, but she is so blinded by her devotion to Victoria that she does not recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. Her initial interest lay only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of her love. But he must pass through the princes and Lamia first. Princes are not such a big problem as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just like in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also finds the witch who enslaved her mother (although he does not know she is his mother) and a bunch of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> The most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays on a tee. He steals the film with his resistance and soon learns a secret undercover that will leave audiences on the floor laughing. Although his role is small in size, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy bad witch. Claire Danes is more appropriate as the confused and anguished Yvaine. She makes a perfect maiden. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of lightness as the fight princes who, as they die, return as ghosts like "Baltic Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> Director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directing experience was "Cake of Layers," brings a charming tale that everyone will enjoy. "Stardust" can be very complex for small children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie several times. That's nice. "Stardust" is what movies should be. Perfectly written, perfectly thrown, perfectly directed and perfectly rendered. In other words ... perfect.
