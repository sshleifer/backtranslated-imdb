Here I thought "Northern Nanook" was the last word in archaic semi-doc 'eskimo' films. How wrong! Like an avid sea kayak, I stayed up until 3 o'clock in the morning to watch it, hoping to catch a glimpse of some handmade "leather boats." The film did not disappoint me. Any student of kayak / umiak construction should take a look here. (Note to fellow SKers: They seem to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single blade blades). <br /> <br /> But the film went far beyond this admittedly limited interest. Although there were, as others noticed some minor flaws, the film has so much heart, that are just a little annoyance. It was (from the point of view of this amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect time to make this film. Early '30s: the talkies are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Really let the Inuit speak in their own language. And there is so much that it still was, despite the infused, authentic melodrama. They are really attacking that polar bear, that whale and that caribou. A fifties version of this movie would have been so extravagant with 'stars', Technicolor, etc. to slip. The seventies version? Not even. A great complement to this excellent film is "White Shadows in the Southern Seas" (1928) Geographically, the mirror image of "Eskimo" also addresses the implacable and profound disturbance of Western culture / technology over an unsuspecting people.
