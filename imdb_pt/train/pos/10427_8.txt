Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from very different backgrounds, he is American and she is French, after they talk a little on the train, Jesse manages to get Celine off the train and explore Vienna with him. For the next few hours, the two roam around Vienna, absorbing everything the city has to offer and falling madly in love with each other. But will this newly discovered relationship last until the sun rises? <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air for a declining genre. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" never bores because of his small cast. In fact, it flourishes because of the bonds that make you love your characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.
