The CAROL JOURNEY is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons. Clara Lago's acting is simply incredible for someone so young, and she's one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. The director Imanol Urbibe presents a rigorous and controlled film, without breaking of continuity, impelling the plot at a constant pace, with enough suspense to keep the person imagining what the scene of the nest will bring. The screenplay by Angel Garcia Roldan is what tells the story at its best, which seems to be the biggest goal of the films, after all. The plot is unpredictable, but events as they unfold are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is to tell a story of the Spanish Civil War as it has affected people. It was a great 20th century event, but almost no American knows that. In fact, in 40 years of university education, I averaged about one student per semester I had even heard of him, let alone anyone who could say anything about it - and the overwhelming number of students were academics of merit. to the enormous amount of censorship in American education. So in a way, this movie is a good way to start a study of this event, keeping in mind that when a segment is pulled, a large part of the story is unraveled. The appreciation of this film is, therefore, in direct relation with the amount of knowledge of somebody. To see this film as another adult film is the lack of the film completely. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of the film - acting, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and art - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for average and 1 for need of help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average in all respects, with the exception of the dialogue classified as medium. The average LEI for this movie is 9.3, increased to 10 when compared to the IMDb rating. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
