... so what's missing 10 minutes that were so horrible that they had to cut them from the original movie? We were three years into the production code of the film ... Barbara Stanwyck had starred in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity" with Stanwyck, as well as his hit "My Three Sons." Keep an eye on young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope films) and the fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who showed each film recorded on tape. Of course, he works in the ship's salon! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good time and smart play in the beginning. Maggie's friend, Ella, is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend of "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", Maggie, the tourist finds a soldier who is leaving the army. Maggie loses the boat when it leaves the port and curls itself on the soldier. Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama, where Johnson (MacMurray) plays the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid come together and try to figure out how to get back to the States. Some good singing for Lamour. Good (but brief) performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph," the wise and helpful owner of the local saloon in Panama. While others lamented how bad it is, it was not so horrible, and it's even a bit exotic, with the fake scenery of Central America for the first half of the movie.
