For those of you who are not aware of the subject that Kusturica continues to exploit intermittently in their films - the Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible for you to understand their narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is the one that Kusturica has elected to command. From his fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's films "Black Cat White Cat," "Life is a miracle," and recently with "Promise Me This," his carnival style underscores the 'Westernization' of the Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional language. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of the city space (urban space) and the village (traditional language) is contrasted. The world of the city reflects the western attributes that harbored the spatial and temporal scenery; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a broken sense of identity and vehement disrespect for traditional values ​​- as expressed to the young boy - villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion when we observe a funeral mass and marriage on a one-way dirt road. They are in a heavy collision; appropriately, marriage, which represents the village's lifeline and pulse, that is, traditional values, is about to collide with the mourners of the funeral, exemplifying the death of tradition within that context. However, Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own stylistic uniqueness. With its outrageous and extravagant style serving as a vehicle in its interpretation.
