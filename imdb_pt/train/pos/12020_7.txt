The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw making a long sentence freeing himself from a chain gang. Does he and his friends go to the Mexican border and security chain? No, they do not, because Coburn has a revenge mission. Kill the peace officer who brought him and in the process killed his wife. <br /> <br /> That peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and knows what Coburn is looking for. As he explains to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was hiding in a shack and was wrapped in a Waco as a standoff. His Indian wife was killed in a shower of bullets. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral victim on a hunt. <br /> <br /> So that we do not feel sorry for Coburn, he shows us very well what an evil man he really is. Heston is his usual brave hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. It blows everyone off the screen when it's turned on. Coburn has the brilliant idea of ​​making sure Heston cheats Hershey by kidnapping him and taking her to an Indian reservation where white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal at the time. <br /> <br /> Coburn's gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along with who his son-in-law is. <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men is a nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen drove and I'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows much of its influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. Of which there is much. <br /> <br /> For a bit of Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
