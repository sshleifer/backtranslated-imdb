It could have been better if it had been run by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great work of film art. <br /> <br /> It is, however, a beautiful film. I loved it from local channels used to show this. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some very bad movies were made from their novels and stories. (Many people love "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them.) I think I've seen "Brighton Rock" once many years ago and enjoyed it, but maybe I'm just thinking fondly about romance.) That's superbly released. Charles Boyer is not, admittedly, seen as Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temper for this character - tired, cautious, affectionate. Lauren Bacall is attractive as the British girl who falls in love with him. But the support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. His performance is a bit Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, with whom we meet for the first time and who teaches Boyer in a universal Esperanto language, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the heart harder. She appears as an early precocious teenager. The character wants to be useful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The reservation is mostly that is a little impassive. But history and acting can hardly be overcome.
