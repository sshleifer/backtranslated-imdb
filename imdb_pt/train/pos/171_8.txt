I strongly disagree with anyone who can dismiss this movie as "fair" entertainment. Set just after the carefree and noisy 20 years, during the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, the Dance is, at heart, a serious warning story with a clear message on how best to withstand these difficult times. However, this fast and well-planned film is far from a tale of gloomy morality. In the 1930s, Hollywood had a knack for producing an enlightening public-pleasure after another, all without wasting a movie frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the * four * movies that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 - has only 80 minutes, but his characters are well-developed, his story never seems rushed, and despite his many twists in the plot, left back. <br /> <br /> With the sole exception of Lester Vail, Bob Townsend, the support cast is uniformly strong. Worth noting are William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (better known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as the gangster Jake Glove. <br /> <br /> It's Joan Crawford's movie, and she absolutely shines in it. Made when she was only 27, this lesser-known version of Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work. However, here's proof that long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the truest sense of the word, a fantastic actress with the charisma of taking a photo by herself. <br /> <br /> Score: EIGHT out of TEN
