I saw the movie for the first time when it landed on the US cable a year after it came out. It blew my little head, I was only 16 years old and it was the first new wave song I heard, having been a strictly folkloric and classical child growing up. The music hypnotized me, as did Hazel O'Connor's incredible visuals and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels's hard but smooth manager, Cockney, just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's drugged saxophonist. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic, he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the movie is not Rose! But he was really excellent for his limited budget and his portrayal of Britain in the early 1980s, blowing up with young rebels, looking for a way out of the waiting line. I went to Britain only a few years later and found that the film reflected very well the atmosphere I encountered when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see. It's a great movie, with some wonderful performances, and the song will end you. <br /> <br />
