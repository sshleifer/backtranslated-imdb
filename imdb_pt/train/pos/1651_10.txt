I watched the show on PBS in the US when it aired in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries was available on DVD, I bought the first issues of all three books last year. Since then I've been looking for the series on movie sites on the internet. Today I found this site. I'll give up the search. <br /> <br /> I would also like to purchase this complete miniseries - 26 episodes. After buying the DVDs, I read each book and watched the episodes in that book. That's what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas Ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or series of books that have become very good TV miniseries - or movie series? available on DVD?
