If The Lion King is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, Lion King 1 and a half is the total opposite, full of whimsy and joy. The Lion King told the story on the side of Simba the young lion, a year and a half is from the vision of Timone and Pumbaa, a less perfect pair composed of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a boar that has an odor problem. The film is a bit short on substance, but Disney does a good job of filling the time with several sketches starring Timone and Pumba as they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is the sing along that happens in the middle of the movie, make sure to watch the bug bouncing! Disney announced a year and a half as "the rest of the story," though it actually is not. It's just a different perspective from The Lion King, without all the serious stuff that permeates most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumba for his voice work, without their efforts, the movie may not have worked. The singers entertain and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a boar.
