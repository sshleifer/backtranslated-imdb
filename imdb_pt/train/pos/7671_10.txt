Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! Anton Mordrid was on Earth for 100 years waiting for Kabal, an evil sorcerer, to come and kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabal. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit confusing at first, but soon you feel part of the action. I will not reveal the ending, so go and see Dr. Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the film very enjoyable because it does not have much violence, or sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and that's what I like! I think the best movies are the ones where times seem to go by. That's because you're so engrossed in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantastic and captivating film! I give it 20 out of 10. Well worth seeing! <br /> <br />
