This is certainly one of my favorite Trek episodes. There's so much going on in this movie that it's really cool. First the guys go down to an alien planet about to explode. They know a kind of weird librarian (very well played). Then Kirk manages to be transported back to what is very much like the Earth of the sixteenth century. McCoy and Spock try to follow him, but they almost freeze to death in the frozen version of the alien world of 100,000 years in the past. Kirk manages to be locked up and accused of witchcraft while Spock spends his time with a sexy cave that has been defeated in the frozen world by a bad guy. Spock decides he's happy and gives McCoy a real harassment when the doc suggests they need to find a way out. Anyway, they all finally escape, leaving the poor cave behind. It takes a lot of convincing before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can literally feel the sadness in the end. Leaving the entire cave alone in her frozen land looks cruel and it's really touching. Spock must have left his volcanic mind to leave behind his greatest hope of love and human being. Despite this, in a not so cool neighborhood! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you make so much money with this episode ... A love story, the Salem witch trials, Spock as a human, the despair of being left in total isolation ... abandoned, and three completely different settings on the alien planet. It's amazing they managed to put it all in a fifty-minute movie. This is a classic, do not miss ... I want on DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
