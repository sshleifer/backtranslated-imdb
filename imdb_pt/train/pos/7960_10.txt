There have been countless talking animal movies in the past, most of which feature digitally animated animal mouths to almost equalize dubbing, or are ridiculously amateurish. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is not at all. <br /> <br /> This film does not need the addition of moving canine lips, nor does it need to gesticulate feline limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to each other, and you can get quite emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great movies of boys and puppies should). Homeward Bound is the epitome of all the animal play for the whole family for me, and features some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive cast ... <br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... Opportunity <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> Frank Welker (Voice of God) ... Miscellaneous This is a modernized version of the classic children's fiction work "The Incredible Journey," which has been transformed into a Disney semi-documentary film long ago in 1963. sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) is not as good as a movie, but extends the adventure of my favorite friends and is a fun urban twist on the great outdoor adventure theme. Want to entertain your kids with a spirited, cute, warm mini-epic without the idiot and often ridiculous comedy of modern children's movies? Parents, buy the three films for your children - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes every time I watch this classic of the 90's!
