Life Stinks (1991) was a step down from other Mel Brooks productions. He stars as a rich man who makes a crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live as a homeless man for a month. His shocked and entertaining friends accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" at the Bowery, he meets a bunch of strangers on the street, one of whom catches his eye (Lesley-Ann Warren). They create a friendship as she teaches the many tricks she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive on his own without the luxury of being rich rotten? Will he win that unorthodox bet? Who are your true friends? Find out when you watch LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie was unfairly run. Of course it's not a classic like your previous films, but it's still fun. I liked the way Mel Brooks pays homage to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've watched Chaplin's previous silent films, you'll also have the humor. Recommended for fans of Mel Brooks.
