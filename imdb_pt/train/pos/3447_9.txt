There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But unfortunately, despite having directed several films that have garnered great international attention, there are still a few of his films that have escaped the breakthroughs. Tachiguishi is one of them, and even though I've loved him in tiny pieces, it's not hard to see why distributors in the West are reluctant to release him. <br /> <br /> Among his big and serious films, Oshii is known for doing some smaller and weirder projects. While Tachiguishi definitely fits into this category, Oshii really got over it, creating something that is very difficult to classify, even as a weird Japanese movie. Go figure. <br /> <br /> At its core is a documentary not unlike Otaku in the Video. But instead of making a fool of an existing subculture, Oshii invents his own and plunges into the lives of culinary heroes, seeking free food and maintaining the Japanese culinary level. Oshii's approach to the subject has close ties to Dai-Nipponjin, as the subject is treated with a deadly sense of gravity while the on-screen images seem as ridiculous as they can be. Impassive humor carried to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, rather than simply filming his fake documentary Oshii decided to do so using a new visual technique called superbook. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and puppets on a stick. Performed and staged (or posed, if you like) by the big names in the Japanese animation industry, since the design should be as cheap as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think it almost covers, know that the film is extremely heavy on dialogues, making it a good complement to Innocence. The influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural, political, and even philosophical angles, fired into the audience through a continuous flow of monologues and dialogues. And to make matters even worse, the whole film is entirely based on Japanese history and customs, making it even harder for a foreigner to have a good grip on the material. Needless to say, multiple views are advised to make the best of all the details hidden within the movie. <br /> <br /> That said, on a conceptual level, the film is easy to follow and already quite hilarious. Several criminals are presented as they were the most influential historical figures in postwar Japan. The film plays as if it were expected that a serious documentary of any other important figure would unfold, but somehow the large, rudimentary members of clipped photography of which figures are mounted are not so serious. The range of characters presented is sublime, Shinji Higuchi carrying the cake as a cow creature wearing a nose piercing, while facing the fast food chains with his bull / people gang. Oshii Kenji Kawai regular, plus a rather comical performance, a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to crazy, strange and comical. It is very entertaining from the noises and exaggerated effects, complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Visually the movie is very atmospheric, although it should be said that the animation is rather sparse and, although effective, remains attenuated, only to explode in hyperactive weirdness from time to time. Which is not exactly a bad thing, seeing how Tachiguishi is as heavy as dialogue. Despite this, the film is still a visual masterpiece, as each frame looks absolutely exuberant and is adapted to match and enhance the overall mood of the film. <br /> <br /> Beware, because Tachiguishi demands a lot from the viewer. . If you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that require some attention. In addition, the monologues in the movie area stretch quite a bit and can be difficult to follow. The film still lacks English subtitles and, although my French has been largely enough to understand everything, I'm sure I missed many of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not easy. movie to enter, but in the middle of the way it reaches the maximum energy and does not exit from there. I still hope to see it again with the English or Dutch submarines. A dub would really be the best for a movie like this (much like Container), though I think a quality anime dub is a bit much to ask for. <br /> <br /> With all that said, I can only congratulate Oshii for another wonderful film. It is rare to find a movie that combines and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is unique and still works. The film is intelligent, looks and sounds good and is full of creativity. It's immensely funny, even if you can not get all the details on the first display. But do not forget to at least get it with acceptable subs, since the automated translation in English that is floating around is completely useless and the movie has no justice at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and it does not surprise me that the French have been released while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the western world) still waiting for a sign of this film. But for those who like Oshii, they enjoy dry, expressionless humor and crave for creative spirits, it's a film that can not be lost even if it can fail. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
