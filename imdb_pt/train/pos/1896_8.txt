Arthur has always been a personal movie for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help with the horses during the stable scene died recently. If you look fast, you may see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background, while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry talk. Frank was an equestrian champion and would miss him for everyone who knew him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, in fact, I have known a real life, Arthur Bach. He was not as wealthy as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life primarily as a child. His parents tightly controlled the purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent much of his time getting intoxicated with various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just as Dudley Moore does. <br /> <br /> The wonder with Arthur is why someone would bother with him no wealth. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a very charming person when you first met him. In fact, it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He could not buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the seller. He spent his life being a perfect guest for the party. The term wastrel that was in common use in the 19th century would apply to it. <br /> <br /> And that's what Dudley Moore is, a spendthrift. Unlike my friend, Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him. This is a full-time job, as shown in Arthur. My friend also never met a Liza Minnelli, a Liza Minnelli man, actually because he was gay. Still, Moore's interpretation of Arthur Bach is extremely accurate and real to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, of the 20th century, is being forced to marry another baby in Jill Eikenberry. As he does not work to live, the threat of being cut is very real to him. He only has his Hobson butler played by John Gielgud and the driver Bitterman played by Ted Post to expose his problems. We should all have such problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud in his nearly century of life has surely done a better job than in Arthur in the movies, and indeed Gielgud is most prominently known for his stage performances. Still, 1981 was a year of Oscar-winning sentiment. The Academy gave Oscars Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn to On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor, essentially for the work of a lifetime. That man was incredible, still in his craft almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So for Frank Graham, who worked on the film and for Jackie Weiss, a real real life Arthur, I dedicate this review.
