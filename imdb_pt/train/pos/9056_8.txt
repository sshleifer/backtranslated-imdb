Then we commit. This was a rather charming film, I liked the art direction (it looked much more "real" than most children's films), and the costumes were not very beautiful. The child actors were not bad to watch (adult performances tended to cheeky). It was great that they showed how a battered kid intimidates others as well as children who are facing bullying. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults would like to see this for themselves, but it's a great movie to get a kid to. And since "Barnyard" was apparently watched by over 100 children at the same time, I'm really glad we chose the sparsely-watched exhibit of "worms" instead.
