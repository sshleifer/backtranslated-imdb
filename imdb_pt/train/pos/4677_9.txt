I understand this movie as a premiere feature and as such is very impressive. It has the feel and rhythm of a "true indie," but director Todd Yellin clearly has the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional. The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to carry the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon present a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical "paint by numbers" type scripts. It is a story that needs talent of character of caliber of Judd Hirsch to have a chance to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; as well as Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin managed to take nuances of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotypes or excesses. Anyway, I find the film refreshing and fun.
