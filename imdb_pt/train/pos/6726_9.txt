Once again Stacy Peralta is true first to the people who lived the story. By letting those involved in the genesis of surfing on the big waves tell us their stories, how they felt and what they thought, you have the feeling of being there. The film takes you from the 50's to the present, focusing on three key architects who contribute to the evolution and development of the sport. The "home movie," like videos of themselves and their contemporaries, takes you into their world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a pure view of the athlete's athletic ability and fabulous big wave images give you a complete perspective of this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth watching.
