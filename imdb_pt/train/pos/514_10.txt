Certainly one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made anywhere. Screenplay, cinematography, direction and acting in a class on its own. This movie works on many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never been shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly screened at the National Film Theater in London to fill homes?
