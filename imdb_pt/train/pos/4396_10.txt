I really liked the detail that went into the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (misspelled) and Jewel excelled in their supporting roles. As Jeffery Wright was. Toby McGuire did as good a job as he had described, when he had to amputate the arm of his best friend, knowing that he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialect training to capture the southern accent incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was swept under the rug by Hollywood promoters that I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes everything more attractive to me. I gave a dozen copies of DVD for gifts. <br /> <br /> Film completely neglected. Rent or buy and give all your attention for a few hours, then judge.
