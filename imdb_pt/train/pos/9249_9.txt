This movie is witty, watchable and totally touching. And now, do you often see Jean Harlow (or any actress of that time) give the other woman a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow's Ruby was sent to a reformatory after he had mingled with Gable's Edward Hall (his grin and affectionate smile), his situation becomes even more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant, and she is convinced that this rake has abandoned her, but in fact, her love has reformed him and he comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested and, with the help of a minister, will be married. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with his teammates is the second in relation to his electrical chemistry with Gable, who was his most frequent leader. His cynical character is a perfect match for the talking Gable villain. What's not to like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not be a bad lady - if it were not for your face!" Ruby speaks enthusiastically to Gypsy, her rival. "If you will get so close to me, I'll have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
