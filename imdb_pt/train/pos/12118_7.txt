When I saw that this movie had only 80 minutes, I thought we were in trouble. Condensing W. Somerset Maugham's gigantic novel for a movie that comes in less than an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. But you know, the film is not at all bad, and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard many movie buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodles of an actor, and he was, but I can not think of anyone better suited to play the role of Philip Carey than in a wet noodles , because that's exactly what Carey is. Howard interprets him well, which means you want to shake him and hit his head repeatedly, then finally take him out and buy a spine for him. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there's Bette, like the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who brings her world crumbling around her. I did not know what the hell Mildred's appeal was in the book, and the film remains true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she becomes the most fascinating character in the story, and if she is unpleasant and unpleasant, she is at least the most dynamic person on the screen at any moment. Davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting as much as Brando would have done almost 20 years later when he shouted "Stella !!" in that little-known piece of Tennesee Williams, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is intense enough to frighten. She makes no effort to wrest any sympathy from the audience, and gets ugly and glamorous. Her appearance when Carey approaches her at the end of the film to find her dead or nearly dead from an unidentified illness (though she's not taken very carefully to hide the fact that she's an STD) is shocking. Of course, it helps that this film started to sizzle before the Production Code came into effect; if it had been done a year later, you can bet things would have been a bit different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the cutting room floor. and the story really turns on Carey and Mildred and not much else. I have found that to be the least interesting and tedious part of Maugham's novel, but it is the title part of the novel and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now, so it seems to me a wise decision on the part of the filmmakers that they chose to adapt the novel in the way they did. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
