I really liked this movie. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes this. She portrays a housewife in an African American family who is climbing the social jail because of her husband's (Danny Glover) success as a lawyer. She moves to an all white neighborhood where people are friendly but a bit awkward for her. The various events that come up during the movie make some laughs, but they usually attract the other emotions. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give a strong 8/10. I recommend you take it on the TV or rent it soon.
