The first part of this notorious horror series features a woman being kidnapped by a gang of men dressed in black who torture her for several days before finally killing her. She is beaten savagely, turned on the chair endlessly, has nails ripped, animal guts are thrown at her, boiling hot water is poured on her, and finally her eyeball is pierced with a needle (scene very sick and nasty). The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and to me this one is the closest thing to a snuff movie that you can grab without committing murder on tape. Of course some of the special effects are pretty bad, but the idea of ​​making a snuff is pretty awful. I also saw "Flowers of Flesh and Blood". which is more bloody and sadistic, but less disturbing. Anyway, this is a must-see for horror fans!
