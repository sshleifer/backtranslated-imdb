The last part of the action thriller franchise is just that probably the most difficult of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne does not like what he's doing and wants to know about his obscure past. Everything about this film goes from the nail of cinematography to the work of choreography / stuntman, from script to acting. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a rush when Bourne is fleeing from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up exactly where the first movie stopped. Or that? The weather is a bit confusing here, but we have the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback when trying to clean almost catches him, but he can and will not kill anyone. They are not your target. From there, we have more of the intrigues of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back, as is Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a past with Bourne as well. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in your face following almost everything. The pursuit of cars is even more intense if this seems possible than the first two. And the veteran cast that pursues Bourne is superb with a beautiful piece of Albert Finney. It also has slight policy implications for delivery and other government policies, but this is minor and is very well integrated into the plot. In short, this is the best of the conclusions from this year's trilogy, if not the best action trilogy of all time.
