This is one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the greatest film of all time. I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an ad on TV for ADGTH and brought back good memories of me watching when I was a kid. And when I watched a few nights ago I became addicted to the movie. Normally I do not like animated family movies, but this is special, it's the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie always touches my heart and it saddens me a lot, but that's what makes this incredible movie better than all the crap that's coming out for children's movies today. I mean that the film is rated G and it's about 2 dogs that are involved with the game, there are a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell pictured in the movie. That I believe makes the movie from good to great. I mean, today's movies do not bring reality to the kids and in this movie they did. <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
