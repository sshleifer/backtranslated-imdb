This is a movie that must be seen by everyone if you want to see a great performance. Mr. Torn and Ms Farrel do a great job. I think they should have it on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> It gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through physically and emotionally. Great unpublished film. <br /> <br /> It was done when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I've always thought of her as a comedian, but this is certainly not a comedy and she's simply wonderful. There are very few dialogues, but this just makes it seem more real. Mr. Torn, as always, is a great presence and only his breathing has a great feeling. I need to watch movie.
