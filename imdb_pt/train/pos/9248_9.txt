Hold Your Man meets Jean Harlow, the working-class girl from Brooklyn falling for scammer Clark Gable and facing all sorts of problems. The film begins as your movie, but by the time the finished emphasis definitely changes for your character. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gable doing a street game with partner, Garry Owen and the brand screaming for the cops. As he is being chased Gable plunges into Harlow's apartment and being he is such a charming fellow, she protects him. <br /> <br /> In a short time she is involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to pull a badger game on a drunken Paul Hurst, but Gable will not go through it. Of course, when Hurst realizes it was a blow, he is still sore and becomes belligerent and Gable has to punch him. But then he ends up dead outside Harlow's apartment and that platinum blonde hair makes it easy to identify. She becomes an accomplice to manslaughter. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about her and her adaptation to life in prison. His interaction with the other female prisoners gave him some very good scenes. I think part of the material was later used for the MGM Caged classic. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets to make the title song and it's done as ballad style torch, very popular in those days. She speaks / sings in the manner of Sophie Tucker and very well. Gable is well-released as a con artist developing a consciousness, a part he often touched, most notably in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> It is still Harlow who begins to shine in this film. I think it's one of the best she's done at MGM, her fans should not miss it.
