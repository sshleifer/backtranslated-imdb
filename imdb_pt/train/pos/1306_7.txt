An unusually direct actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as you would expect from a clearly filmed movie on a tight budget, but the drama is involved - it's one of those movies that when it's repeated ad nauseum in Cinemax 2 or More Max or as they call it, you end up watching blocks of 40 minutes when you should be going to work. Alongside W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget colleagues who have a real ability to make a movie when he really is interested in the material (ie, do not bother seeing your Shannon Tweed movies with 3 or 4 after the title!) Actors who have had little to do recently (Mancuso, Ford, to Gary Sandy by chrissakes ) really put their all in some of their best roles in years - as for Grieco, he has the right look, although his acting is a bit of a note - it is clear that his character is to be self-destructive throughout the film, but Grieco can not convey it. I checked the IMDB and see that the writer also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for the director - both minor classics in their own right, but obviously "silly" Roger Cormon-like Cinema - this is more like some of the best photos of Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan of the '70s - giving you the element of exploration, but offering drama involving at the same time - a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane," and the comedic final moments are a bit disturbing, but an above-average, well-written, character-driven straight-to-video actioner. Small accomplishments like this should not be neglected when they come up, which is rare enough (as I remembered when I tried to go through an Albert Pyun monstrosity called "Heatseeker" the other night - this low-budget material is not as easy as it looks - But that is another story!)
