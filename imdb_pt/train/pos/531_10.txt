This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this movie for the first time a week ago since every day I see the opening and every time I feel as thrilled as I felt the first time I heard David Niven uttering the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh's pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> Give me my scallop shell of silence, My faith team to walk on, My scripts of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My dress of glory, the true hope of the gage; And so I will take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburgers are completely justified by having created such a wonderful opening? Because they had already been admitted into the Paradise of the Poets long before they made the film. <br /> Imagine the two facing judgment during the Last Judgment Day and saying indifferently to an angry God: I beg your pardon, Lord. So you want to know what we've done in our lifetime? Well, you'll see: We write directed and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think enough, sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature, Muse or whatever you may call "When to Kill Life and Death". The fact that other people's lives would be justified by their actions might not be apparent to everyone, though I think my life would have meaning if I had never done anything else to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Veterans will be tempted to say: they do not make movies like that anymore. They will be partially deceived; they also have not made movies like this in recent times. <br /> <br /> I have already mentioned Keats here, but I will repeat his words: A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
