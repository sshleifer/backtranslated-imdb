The barbarians may not be the best movie any of us have ever seen, but really ???? ........ It's so funny ...... I can not describe how I laughed when I first saw it .. The director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it's so bad .. so bad it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ...... So my advice is you should see it ..... and if you ever did, get it again !!!!! !!
