This is probably one of the most unique love stories I have seen for centuries, especially for a movie based on war (briefly). Basically, it's a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictional, but the filmmakers say at the outset that it's just coincidence if it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was going to crash on a plane, he talked to June (Kim Hunter of the Planet of the Apes) before leaving and saying he loved her. He was destined to die from jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he is seeing and loving June in the flesh. This other place, like a paradise, is unfortunate because he survived and should come to their world, so they send the French maestro 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life in the other world's court, he is granted this. Obviously, love prevails when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, and June offers to take his place! Also starring Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as An Angel, a brief (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as An English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as The Judge / The Surgeon. David Niven was number 36 in The 50 Greatest British Actors, the movie was number 86 in The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, was number 47 in The 100 Greatest War Films, was number 46 in The Greatest British Movies, and was number 59 in The 100 Greatest Films. Exceptional!
