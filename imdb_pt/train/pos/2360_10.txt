He felt that he was well-balanced in showing what Jehovah's Witnesses did to protect American liberties. He also showed the strong faith of two families who were witnesses of the first generation. I also liked how this became a Jehovah's Witness affects family members who are not witnesses and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays, the sad part is that families who are not witnesses do not think about having your family witnesses for family dinners / visits or give them gifts at any other time except holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow medical care and sloppy surgeries, while bloodless treatments make the medical staff highly qualified and trained, what do you prefer? treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
