A high-profile Columbus story that was actually the first episode filmed from the long series, but was originally broadcast in second place (after "Murder By The Book"). Robert Culp makes his first three appearances as the guest killer in the series and plays the owner of a detective agency, who blackmails his wife (Patricia Crowley) of a wealthy and influential businessman (played very sympathetically by Ray Milland) after he falsifies a report in your favor. , after it is discovered, she was having an affair. The wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme, but is killed in a fit of rage .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many ways, particularly because the plot is so strongly established and subsequently developed. also because of Columbus's rare ingredient that crime is an unpremeditated murder. The whole thing is reinforced when the widowed husband uses the killer to help Columbus in his investigations: a feature that facilitates numerous good-quality scenes, particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and Columbus's crucially deceptive qualities are marvelously in evidence. Directed with talent by Bernard L. Kowalski and acted to a suitably high level, this really set the tone for entire series (since "Murder By the Book" was disappointed by a bad ending). The script by Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link is accurate, well structured and well thought out and is sustained by a stable and productive rhythm and significant sequences that truly exhibit the unpredictability of the story. Ultimately, the end fits perfectly that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great detective job for Columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team worked positively. and constructively to render a polished history of Columbus.
