This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootings, bad guys and worse faces. It's fun to watch James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he's gotten himself into since he stole $ 12 million from the great final boss "The Skipper." That sounds cheesy. If you can overcome the silly storyline than you will find that this movie has some surprises in store.You can argue that the twists are predictable, but the fast pace of this film does not give him time, and also thinks too much, which is a blessing, since this film is not about revealing the definitive turnaround. people hated this movie, they were probably expecting a movie about mobsters rather than some bad guys coming across.
