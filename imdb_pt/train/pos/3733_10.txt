I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after returning. So when I saw part of that movie one night on a pay-for-view channel, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt when he prepared for Vietnam. I left and rented this movie and have to say it's the most exciting movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way you pull so many different directions emotionally is something I've never experienced with any other movie. As for the films on Vietnam affairs, I think it's the best, although Platoon runs a close second. On top of all that, I think it's also Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like him in most of his movies, but in this movie he was amazing. I gave it a 10 because it's one of my five favorite movies.
