I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was really cool! Now I'm 26 years old, and my friend is on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We took a box of beer and watched this classic! He lost NO of his original kung fu coolness! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called "Pick Your Poison". <br /> <br /> Watch soon!
