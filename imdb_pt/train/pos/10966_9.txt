Gray Gardens is a world unto itself. Edith and Little Edie live in almost total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in an impromptu kitchen in their (seemingly) shared room. Cats play while their mother Edith insults her daughter's elocution. This is a Tennessee Williams piece that comes to life and should inspire writers and playwrights, since the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation in the house reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50 year old daughter lived for a decade (unless they were poor and clean). They fought all day, the grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past, while her daughter continually blamed her for lost opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must-have for anyone writing a mother-daughter relationship of this type. It's sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an incredible job, leaving the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. It is rare to see true life this way and even more special considering the context - remnants of a powerful family that vanishes into nothingness in the skeleton of its own mansion.
