This film is head and shoulders above the great majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It's practically flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and excitement are wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is captivating and delicious! <br /> <br /> Each character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the protagonists of Cher and Nicolas Cage to the many supporting roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - to grandpa with his backpack! Each of these artists, in addition to Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this joint work. For many of the actors, this was a major early exposure on film, so the cast is also exceptional - and we have many acting powers today whose careers have been altered by their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times all the time - which can sometimes substantially reduce the impact of a movie. More revealingly, I realized a few years ago that whenever I surfed the channel in a scene from this movie - any scene - the scene was attractive and beautifully crafted. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes in the original encounter between the characters of Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story of sadness; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his lover in the opera, amid the splendor generated by his business of plumbing gold mines; Olympia Dukakis reprimanding John Mahoney for dating his student on the classic line about connections with co-workers: "Make no mistake where you eat!"; Danny Aiello on the bed of his dying mother; Nicolas Cage "taking" Cher as the rapture of an aria rises to the bottom! There are, of course, many romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially the original Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry Met Sally; The apartment. <br /> <br /> No one is the same as Moonstruck!
