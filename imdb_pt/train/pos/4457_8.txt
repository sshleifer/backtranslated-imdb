Yes, this is one of the great music movies I grew up with great artists like Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the small and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dance are superb. I understand that Frank took classes with Kelly; and there's Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays a waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's big underrated stars. I saw it again on A & E TV and also on my old VCR tapes. Never get tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood?
