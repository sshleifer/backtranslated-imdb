* a few spoilers * I was pleasantly surprised to discover the harsh criticism (acting, dating dialogue, plain plot) unfounded. Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, threatening and voracious spirit who needs to gain his wings, but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so. He learns too late how the emptiness of his materialistic life was without love. Mostel is equally as great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one. The two social worlds that the characters represent alternately collide and complement each other, the result is hilarious and poignantly sad. <br /> <br /> The bewildering end is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After searching around Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a feather falling, and he searches frantically as if he was finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte could not finish his miracle (to restore Fanny's or Mostel's health), so he never got his wings. The feather floats teasingly out of Mostel's reach, a metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you do not get a second chance. Like "It's a Wonderful Life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
