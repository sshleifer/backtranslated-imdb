How can you make a mistake with the incredible Ramones? What a crime two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while the useless live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. HIGH SCHOOL ROCK AND ROLL tells the story of a group of marginalized children struggling against the oppressive administration of high school. It's an extremely silly thing, but there's an optimism about it that is refreshing (even if they use the building). Who knew this would become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule from a time when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to society in general. It's full of children who know that authority does not have the right answers. On the contrary, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But the most important thing is that this is pure exploration. <br /> <br /> Do not take any of this seriously. Just come in and have fun. If that was not what life was like in high school in the seventies, then it should have been.
