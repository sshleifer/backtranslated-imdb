A very well made film set in the early 1960s in communist Yugoslavia. The five young teen actors at the center of the story give strong, heartfelt and emotionally deep performances. A clear description of how the natural trust and ingenuity inherent in adolescents can be easily manipulated and how it has impacted the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
