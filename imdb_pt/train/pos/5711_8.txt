In Le Million, Ren√© Clair, one of the great directors and great pioneers of cinema, created a light comedy that, for all its lightness, is an innovative and technically brilliant film that clearly influenced the subsequent filmmakers such as the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch , and Mamoulian. The plot, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot, but has to frantically search the entire city for the lost ticket, is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comedic scenes staged in a world of dreams. the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this film is that despite being in the middle of Paris and not including anything really impossible, it achieves a sustained and engaging fairy tale atmosphere. , in which it seems natural that people sing as much as they speak, or that a dispute over a stolen jacket takes the form of a football game. Another memorable piece is that Le Million includes what may be the funniest opera ever released in the movies (oh that blonde braid soprano!) I laugh, ha! Ha! ") Also a delight the cast: Clair set up a group incredible actors of the character distinctly different, each of them accurately illustrating deadly satirical a "kind" bourgeois French, so that the film looks like a set of Daumier prints coming to life. <br /> <br /> The hilarity takes a while. to begin with, I found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they might be, even in a light comedy (as they are, for example, in many Lubitsch films). For these reasons, I abstained from giving the highest mark. But these little flaws should not divert attention from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> If you see this? By all means. Highly recommended if you want a classic and influential movie job or just a fun comedy.
