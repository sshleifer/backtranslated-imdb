Some critics found this film somber, but for me there was enough good humor and optimism to overcome that impression. For example, her daughter's quietly positive and stoic character is still the center of the film, often counteracting the unfortunate aspects of the setting and plot. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of ideas and original characters, and the end result is not predictable: I felt it could have been anyway. <br /> <br /> By the way, many of the reviews I've read mention the actual use of black and white, but the impression I saw, shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia, was in color. <br /> <br />
