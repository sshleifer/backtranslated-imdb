Tian's remake is not good. I just click on her documentary remake to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the exhibition of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun at Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, his appearance in Hong Kong films is always a surprise to his fans. At this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic film, and Wei Wei's filming of the film is being seen in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei is so beautiful back then.
