"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it's a lot of fun and accessible to many audiences. The original film could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke rewriting his signature on the Broadway role, but instead they fixed the plot, so the film is very unsatisfying. This reissue, which aired on ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script, and includes some original songs that were used in a national tour from which this film took off, starring Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this film .) Jason Alexander is a very different type of Dick Van Dyke, but he is well-scaled as Albert, (before his "Seinfeld" days, he started in musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. His is also a great work of Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role he played on the national tour). <br /> <br /> This movie is not without problems, though. The biggest responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, as attractive as she is, just looks and looks too old to be teenager Kim. And George Wendt is a bit insipid as her father, playing a little "kids" (an original cast number with whom Paul Lynde stole the show). <br /> <br /> But on the whole, this is a pleasure, well done film that the material deserved.
