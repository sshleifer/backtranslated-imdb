I just watched this movie, maybe for the 7th or 8th time, I got a night before at Blockbuster and I loved it, I showed it to 4 people so far and they liked it too. Avoid all the glamor of Hollywood, special effects and stress on the "shock factor," this independent Paul F. Ryan movie hit full on the head when dealing with the later affects of traumatic situations. Occurring after a high school shooting, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely link. Alicia, the girl with the heart of stone, the goth who has a pessimistic attitude toward life, helps Deanna overcome the issues of life and death and live in the aftermath. Meanwhile, Deanna tries to help Alicia see some of the softness and light in the world again. Not stressing in the shocking event of the shooting, but in the interpersonal relations between those who survived, the film undoes. Despite its low budget and short shooting time, this film is far from tacky. Ryan respects a situation he never endured and tries to delve into the human psyche. With an incredible and promising actress, Philipps adds the dramas needed for dialogue and the overall feel of the film, and Christensen helps balance the feeling that the film may have. Overall, I highly recommend this film and if you like the theme of school bullying and violence and learning more about it, I also suggest the documentary "It's a Girls World" published by CBC in 2004 that addresses the issue of social bullying by comparing and contrasting two groups of girls, one in Montreal, Quebec, and another in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who killed herself after being brutally mistreated.
