I did not have much interest in watching The Flock. Andrew Lau co-directed the Infernal Affairs masterpiece trilogy, but he had been fired from The Flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I had the feeling that Lau had made a good movie but had not satisfied the study so they dismissed him and hired another director. This usually does not work well (let's remember the invasion). But the herd turned out to be better than What I expected. It's not a great movie but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The character's development is very well done and I could get to know the characters very well. Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible .Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring in competent performances. Now let's get down to the negatives. One element that really bothered me (there was a time when it irritated me) was the excess editing tricks to give the movie more "attitude" and style. What tricks seem out of place Their presence is arbitrary. Besides, I think the film should have been more ambitious. Despite this, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not memorable, but it's fun.
