Stylish, moody, innovative bloodbath driven by revenge. Also tacky, of course, and sporadically very tacky. It reminded me so much of The Big Heat because it has the revenge plan triggered by the same event, and the girl comes to the good guy's side because of the bad behavior of the bad guy. It's sad that there is Gloria Grahame, but it's so fantastic that it's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be someone as handsome as Alain walking around in a cashmere sweater and a waterproof coat? However, it is totally hard and cold. No one can touch him these days - although someone like Jude Law could try it, I think. Hard for any girl to get along with him. The music was funky and flawless and there were several excellent car chases (and these are not usually my cup of tea) - especially a Willy in the woods. People also knew their deeds in a creative and bloody way, for example, in a junkyard crusher. But beyond the cheese, the general atmosphere was affecting and cleverly ripped off. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this movie "forgotten" than most of what I've seen lately.
