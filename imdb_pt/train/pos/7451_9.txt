Here's one that the whole family will like ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall was overcome with this unique and imaginative vision of almost all the popular fairy tales of childhood. The scripts offer new twists in the old fables we grew up in and have a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard and, in my opinion, is one of the top five in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember "Flashdance" - and she's still in Hollywood making a movie here and there ) in the title role, Jean Stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and Eve Arden as the impersonation of the wicked stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden make a hilarious duo like the sisters. Matthew Broderick is an affable Prince Henry. You all will keep coming back to this one!
