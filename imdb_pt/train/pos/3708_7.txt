A lawyer is drawn to a deadly game of cat and mouse when engaging with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a gothic atmosphere of suspense, but the script is weak. Boasting a southern accent, Branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is attractive as the object of his desire. Downey is nice as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger complete the impressive cast. After an interesting setting, the film is limited and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always worth a look.
