Originally I rented this movie for my daughter, since she likes football a lot - and I was not disappointed with that (except that the plot interfered in the football scenes). As a parent, I suppose I was a bit surprised at the introduction of the lesbianism theme - but I have to admit that, as a parent, these issues are completely available to children nowadays (no matter how uncomfortable I feel about it). In a way, this emotion was a direct step to the movie's premise - that at some age you should trust your kids to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British teenager - Jasminder (Jess) - of East Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional football. Her older sister's wedding at a traditional Hindu wedding offers many opportunities for her to explore (in a pleasant way) her hopes and fears about her future. The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique for exploring Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations of her - again no different in substance than most parent-child relationships. <br /> <br /> In short, the football scenes are great (a lot to learn in slowmo) and although I did not need the plot - something was needed to keep the movie running.
