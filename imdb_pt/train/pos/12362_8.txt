I'll be quick to broach the subjects of the film here: It was a very engrossing story about the destructive qualities about all the consuming passions; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally connect with her politically radical fianc√© arrested (partly because of her apolitical attitudes and carefree approach to life) finds solace and passion in a new young lover with whom she embarks on an explicit sexual relationship. The anxieties, the rage, the tenderness and the passions that circulate in the atmosphere of the story equate the dispassionate stillness that seems to engulf the two directions. This lends the film a disturbing climate that permeates the entire political struggle that is lost on the viewer (unless you have a thorough understanding of Italian politics during the 1980s). I found the film convincing ... what spoiled a bit is a free oral sex scene that the actress plays in the lead role ... is not simulated and leaves little to the imagination. There are other sex scenes in the movie, which I think are necessary because they describe the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the scene of oral sex, I feel, makes it impossible to focus on real history. It was quiet to navigate to that point and since the infamous sex scene appears (which caused a lot of uproar on your day), it's like hitting an obstacle. It is shocking and unnecessary and I am in the field who believes that the film would not have been harmed if the scene had been removed from it. And what is unfortunate is that this particular scene may prevent people from watching this intriguing movie, which, I believe, is worth seeing, because there is a lot going on beneath the surface, additional emotions and riots in the subtext. <br /> /> General: Wonderful movie impaired by an unnecessary sex scene.
