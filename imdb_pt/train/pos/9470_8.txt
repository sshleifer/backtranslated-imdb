I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie about Dan, a board columnist who goes to his parents' house to stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. It is a story that was told before, but not so. There are just so many little bits that make the movie better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is very good as the widower who must know everything, but discovers that knowing is different from feeling and sometimes life surprises him. Sometimes witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card may be, the movie still manages to grow in you and be something more than a factory movie run. Worth a look
