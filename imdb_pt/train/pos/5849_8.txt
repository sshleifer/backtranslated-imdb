Damn straight ..... this show was butt back in the day and still continues to obfuscate cartoons today. I can not wait to track down some of the DVDs to share with my guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one) and I laughed out of my head when he said to me one day "Dad ... you sure saw some amazing drawings when you were a kid !!" How cool is that. <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, take off that dust and give it a live action try. It could not be worse than Spider-Man 3 was ... Man, oh man ... 2007 has been pretty bad so far for summer movies. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll shiver now <br /> Congratulations
