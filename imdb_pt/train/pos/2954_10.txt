This film, however, critically acclaimed, of course has not yet been released in the US on DVD, as another great "Housekeeping" by Christine Lahti in the same year. But if you can support DVDs from Region 4 (Australians), this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some copies of VHS available on the internet as well. David is complemented by a great story as well as memorable performances from his supporting cast, especially Claudia Carvan and the late Jan Adele. Surprisingly, or perhaps not, this movie and its stars were not recognized at the time of the Oscars, as it did "Housekeeping", but deal with both - you'll be glad you did!
