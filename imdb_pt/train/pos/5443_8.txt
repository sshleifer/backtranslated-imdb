For what it is, this is a very good movie. I like Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong performances. Love interest is OK, but this is more of a guy movie than a good dating movie. I love Harleys, and I hated watching them paint on the "14 coats of hand-wiped varnish" with the good old Army Olive Drab. There is a little history lesson here in which Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I do not know if the training was very similar to that bunch! The film kept my interest the whole time without getting slow anywhere, with good action sequences of piloting. I love looking at the demographics of voting history - an 18-year-old man gave the film a 10 (true bicycle lover, I think). I would not give a 10, but I gave an 8. I do not weigh all the movies with the same scale. There are movies that have been big budgets, with great actors that you hope are good, so when they fail, they fail a lot. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
