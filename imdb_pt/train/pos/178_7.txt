"Protocol" is a hit-and-miss photo starring Goldie Hawn as a cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of an Arab visitor from a murder attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our nation be the same? Hawn is excellent as ever, although "Protocol" is not as funny as his best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
