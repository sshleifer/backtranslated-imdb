I like my bold and elegant Ronald Colman, the guy you see in movies like If I Were King and Kismet. I like it as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A thoughtful Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in A Double Life precisely because his participation as actor Anthony John is so unusual to him, Colman was recognized with an Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. It became his best known part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who really takes the method very seriously. He has just finished a successful run in a comedy of good manners and he is a very jovial guy. For a change of pace, now that the play has completed its Broadway season, Colman is bringing a rebirth from Othello to New York. The most opposite part you can get. <br /> <br /> His protagonist in both is his ex-wife Signe Hasso, who loves him a lot but can not change his mood when he's at work. Colman loves her very much and wants her back. But he is headed for a mental breakdown when he starts to confuse himself with the envious Moor Othello and Hasso with his role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters as a poor waitress that Colman depressed picks gets in the way of her madness and she ends up as poor Desdemona in the play. Murdered the same way and now it's a matter for homicide cop Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Is Colman's performance so good that you can imagine that this is an occupational hazard for the actors? I would shudder to think so, if there were some unresolved homicide around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, then they tested Othello. <br /> <br /> I never got to buy the story for that reason, but I certainly applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part. I'm sure there was a bit of regret for him winning the Oscars because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others in the race that year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman gets support from the rest of the cast including Edmond O 'Brien, who is in the undesired part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. Still, you will not find any equivalent Iago in A Double Life, no one poking envy, it's all in your mind. <br /> <br /> And that of one of the most cultured and civilized minds of the last century.
