I love these movies "Diaper Baby"! You could not make a movie like this today and it's rich in film history. It's silly and the movie was made to make you laugh, which does. How they got these children to "act," I'll never know. I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh, but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naivety that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had fallen, the world depression was starting and these movies were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you can watch movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but dinner for 25 cents is fine too. It was a different time with a totally different mindset.
