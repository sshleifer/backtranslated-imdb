Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the Stooges' best short bar, and they are right. Curly is a scream dragging dress as "Senorita Cockroach", and Moe and Larry are in their best shape as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. The beautiful operatic voice of Christine McIntyre is full of reins - she was actually a trained opera singer - and she is wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer terrified by the Stooges at a society party. Really funny jokes, good direction and very limited editing make it to the top of Stooges' prolific production. What's even more surprising is that Curly was having serious health problems at the time, and in several of the shorts he did during that period, you can see that he is obviously ill; his time is very far, he speaks very slowly and hesitantly, and has difficulty getting around. Fortunately, his health was on the rise when he made this movie, and it shows. Stooge's classic comedy, and tanned by non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who could not stand the Stooges, but even laughed at it). Unmissable.
