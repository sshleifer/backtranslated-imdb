Reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this film, even though I only have a video version dubbed in Japanese. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to consider that the premise of the story has been used before, most notably in the great "It's a Wonderful Life." For me, a major premise is a major premise, no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy to see more movies using that particular premise - the disgruntled man who has a chance to gain a new perspective on his own life through of some "divine magic." <br /> <br /> I suppose people and critics of a more intellectual inclination are not so drawn to the story, but I do not go to the movies to criticize them with a notebook in hand - I go to the movies to play in them and let them take me wherever they want. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental like me, you will be well rewarded to see this photo. The performances are excellent and the film was very well released. Wonderful choice of music too. Michael Caine is superb as the friendly bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job as an "ordinary Joe" guy who wonders if his life was not as it should be. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again on target as the loving wife. Jon Lovitz entertains as always, and even has some surprisingly thrilling moments in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a Wonderful Life," but who says it has to be? Taken on its own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is a nice, well done, funny and moving film. I've seen my numbered Japanese video several times, and I'm sure I'll see it several more times. If that somehow makes me a lowbrow, so be it! I'm glad I did not read any reviews of "Mr. Destiny" before I saw her. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I could not help but doubt myself after reading all the critical comments!
