Every day we can watch a lot of movies, soap ... on tv. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director-director. For me there are two movies that everyone needs to see: the first is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope." As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love for others, about accepting another civilization, another way of living. We also have to fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; we just have to love our land mate. This wonderful film helps us achieve John's dream (Lennon): Imagine that all the people who live live in peace. These two films are hard to see: watch them, but you're sure to be hurt, but better. Great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and guarantee of crying, but also better understanding of others. Enjoy.
