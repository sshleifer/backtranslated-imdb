Not knowing what this movie was, I checked into the store and after seeing it, I liked it. Little seen film of several genres of director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a Glenne Healdy's fan, I was surprised by his British accent. The only exception to this movie was the ending. However, it is worth the rent.
