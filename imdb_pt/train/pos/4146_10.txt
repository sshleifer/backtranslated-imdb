Anyone who has lived through the times of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will enjoy this movie. It's one of those movies that offers everything you want in a "Spring Break" movie, plus make fun of the college film genre. It's funny, there's a cast to die (Amy Pohler!), Rachel Dratch !, Sophie Monk !, Parker Posey !, Jane Lynch, Amber Tamblyn !, Missi Pyle !, and her guarantee to make you laugh out loud. Writer / actor Rachel Dratch is a comic book genius and Sophie Monk is a big villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I'm just repeating myself now ...) He's going to live with girls who like Miranda July, but they feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb.
