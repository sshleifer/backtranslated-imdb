It was only in my second exhibition, years later, that I realized two things about this film: 1) I enjoyed it immensely, and 2) because its execution is decidedly more accurate than the premise itself guarantees. I had laughed over the film before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests - valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness (just * good * - airheadedness -natured) are simply not inherently funny, especially when drawn to the length of the feature. But as the film's momentum begins to spread in the end, Reeves, Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) exhibit a comic sense of humor so remarkable that even the most spoiled jokes (eg, Ted not recognizing a certain inhabitant of Hell) works as easily as those who are dying (for example, the challenge). And the team of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the team of Bill and Ted (who spends only a separate scene throughout the movie, disaster if they are not well matched) seems totally unconstrained. <br /> <br /> (Note: I found the first movie only sporadically entertaining - apparently different comedic sensibilities there, it seems). <br /> <br /> I give a 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
