The acting in this film was superb. As an amateur rocketeer, I found very few mistakes. As a human being, it touched my heart and soul. To watch the actors, you would think they are the real characters. Laura Dern, one of my favorite actresses, left nothing out of her performance. The young actors who play the Rocket Boys have shown talent beyond their years, especially the young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love-hate relationship between father and son, so it seemed real. If you do not have a lump in your throat or shed a tear when the first successful rocket rises or when the father and son come to an agreement, then check the wrist (you may be dead).
