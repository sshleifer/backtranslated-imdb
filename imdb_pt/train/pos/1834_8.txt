This is the film is very moving. I do not care what people say about this movie, this is a really good movie. The performances of the role of Amitabh Bachchan make the father die to be great because he wants to teach his son to deal with life should something happen to him and Akshay Kumer would be great in his role as the spoiled Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good at her little role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as the brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as the show-in-law's father-in-law has a very good connection and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
