This film is not complicated, despite the low production and its link to the productions of Troma. A dark fable for adults. Exploration is a Sugar Cookies theme, and someone wonders if the cast did not fall on the theme. A strange movie with appealing visuals: shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth a look, especially from Warhol fans and stylish decadence. Through all the cruelty and wickedness, a morality, although distorted, can be glimpsed.
