Hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced before the imposition of the Bluish Hayes Code. Yes, in fact, the priests told their flocks that anyone who was to see this movie was committing a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I'm not making this up. They had several reasons as follows: Item: Jane likes sex. She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their shelter by the treetops. She stretches sensually, and with a flirtatious look says, "Tarzan, you were a bad boy!" So they not only had sex, they also had perverted sex! Some years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) should not be portrayed as if they were enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane prefers a sincere, though wise and resourceful savage (Tarzan) to a civilized and respectable man from nine to five (Holt). When Holt impresses her with a beautiful London gown, she wavers a little; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane believe that he is dead, she swings a lot. But when she realizes that her man is very alive, the attractions of civilization disappear for her. And why not? Tarzan and Jane's relationship is egalitarian: he does not have the "civilized" insecurity that would force him to assert himself as "the boss of his wife." To boot, it does not have many more "civilized" hangups, for example, envy. When Holt and his friend arrive, Tarzan greets them cordially, knowing full well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt wraps it up in a London dress and dances slowly with her to a portable phonograph, Tarzan descends from a tree and picks up his knife. Jealous? No. He is only wary of the strange music machine, since he has never seen one before. Once explained, it is cool. <br /> <br /> Item: Civilized Holt is dirty. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. As Jane slides into Holt's tent, Holt watches her silhouette as she turns into the extravagant dress. In contrast, after Tarzan takes off her play dress, kicks her into the hole and dives behind her, there follows the hottest naked scene in the entire movie: the couple spend five minutes in a lovely aquatic ballet. filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the movie's release, but the nude version is restored in the video now available.) And when Jane emerges, and Cheetah, the chimpanzee steals her dress only by a provocation , Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their problems. Where is "universal recklessness" so dear to the hearts of the seminarians? Nowhere, that's where. Another reason why the hangman considered this film sinful. Item: The notion that man is the crown of creation, and the animals are here only for the use and comfort of man, takes a severe beating. Holt and his friend want to be led to the "elephant graveyard" so they can pick up the ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to guide them to the graveyard. You, reader, are thinking of "maybe fat!" and you are right. He's shocked. He exclaims "Elephants sleep!" which explains everything to him. Jane explains the feelings of Tarzan, which the two "gentlemen" think ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane, the ex-civilized woman, is far more ingenious than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and his friend explode and are besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. It's Jane who stays calm. While the boys panic, she takes charge, gives them orders, and distributes the rifles. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane's outfit is a kind of poncho with nothing underneath. (The original idea was for her to go topless, with foliage artfully blocking her nipples, which is indeed the case in a brief scene.) <br /> <br /> Finally, several men in the cloth complained that film was called "Tarzan and his companion" instead of "Tarzan and his wife". No comments! <br /> <br /> Of course Tarzan, who was aided by his ape friends, comes to the rescue, steals the white hunters, and induces the elephants and the Africans to return the ivory. they stole the sacred place from which they came. The end. <br /> <br /> So you have it. A totally subversive film. Like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey) that constituted such a fluid genre in the early 1930s and were brought to such abrupt end by the adoption of the Hays Code. <br /> <br /> The joy of living in this film is best expressed by Jane's soprano version of Tarzan's famous cry. A beautiful touch, which unfortunately has been abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear the artistic freedom, the feminist Jane and the sex.
