I kind of liked The Lonely Lady. Give Pia time. She looks great and she has really nice eyes. What's not to like? The scene in which she is raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was kind of rude and cruel. In fact, many things that happen in this movie are rude and cruel. But it's a useless movie. Many movies that are useless are not all bad ones. I liked it better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not just useless, but boring too. At least that was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia gets nude a lot and looks miscast as a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy who is three times his age is unbelievable. I'm sure Pia is a cool person in real life, she just does not project the writer's vibe. She looked much happier when she was working as hostess for the Saturday Night Fever guy and wearing a shiny disco dress. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are funny. The one in which she tells the two-time actor that she's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and clings to her to "stop walking around!", All the while he's practically flattering all the rumbling buds. <br /> <br /> The scene of Pia's nervous breakdown is good. It was probably a mistake to go so supernovae about him (the vortex of floating faces and frozen screams - whoa!) And his subsequent catatonic stupor is a bit of an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> The acceptance speech is a hoot. , Although. I want to see someone do this speech in a theater class. <br /> <br /> But again, this is rubbish we're talking about. You could find worse in any movie of the week in the eighties.
