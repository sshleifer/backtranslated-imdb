This movie is so much fun. I recommend that you watch and then watch again with your friends. I did last night and it was fascinating how Norma Khouri could pull everyone in her world! I felt a little strange watching my friends pass by the same roller coaster as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talking about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a crook almost at the level of Norma Khouri, but not near the ring of the same size. He tricked very naive and wealthy people into my old CA Berkeley A.A. group where everyone trusts everyone else. He would "sponsor" only people who seemed very well to do. Who knew he would have stolen more than 100k (in 1987, when it was real money) after being in town for only 1 month. Their victims were as fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober. He was mean with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The crime above is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did with her former neighbor. But I do not want to give anything. <br /> <br /> I just found out tonight on a late night movie channel, "Showtim," I think. This is always the best experience for a movie fan to be totally fooled into seeing something and having his mind exploded. Just drag your friends to see this and tell them nothing. It's a really fun movie, it moves quickly and never bores you. <br /> <br /> This must be an international classic of all time. I believe all the great movies will end up on top. The weather will be very good for this movie. I'm just sorry no one has heard of it, somehow that makes surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> JUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!
