Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars are from CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (I imagine what Luca is currently doing, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey, son of shadows "Anyway, in Thorn's EMI video, there's no song about opening credits ... but the music is great when it comes ... with Italian films, movies they are not as good as the music ... my favorite scene is with the kid with the robotic arm following the alien through the desert.Alternative says why are you following me? Tommy responds because I feel that ... Alien responds that Way you're going to Tommy says West then Alien says well, I'm going east So after a long walk, the theme playing in the background Alien looks up and sees Tommy sitting on a rock stroking a pet hamster .. Tommy look up and tell Alien, what took you so long ... I love this movie ... It touches my heart. The boy with the robot's arm needs a father and Alien is recruited to be Tommy's father in the desert. . . Oh yeah, they need water too. . . not THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) by any means, but a silly Western movie / post nuke with a boy with a robotic arm and Alien and Trash and some other good guys with an evil girl with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL who looks like Wez on the road warrior. . On Sunday afternoons on Channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA) after church, I would come home and find this. . . often . . . oftentimes. Love. 10/10
