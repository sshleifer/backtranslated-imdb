This movie is a great rhythm, you never have to wait for a belly laugh for more than a minute and there's a lot more going on than the movie's initial premise. Along the way, there are mockery of the traditional schmaltzy genre of boys-of-the-place-done-good-overcoming-adversity of which these parodies. Do not let anyone tell you that you're trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities - of course, there's a lot of that, but it's all contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it cost me just Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so in terms of entertainment value it was the best movie I saw this year.
