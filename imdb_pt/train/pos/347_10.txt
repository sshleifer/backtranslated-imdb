Valentine is now one of my favorite horror movies. The death scenes are elaborate and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton did very well as the female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the films "I Know ..."). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason I saw this movie, played a very small role, but it played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was awful at it. The only scene I was happy to see her was * SPOILER * her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before watching "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
