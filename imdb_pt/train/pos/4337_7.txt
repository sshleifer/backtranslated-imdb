I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use a lot of profanity for no reason at all. Maybe this is your idea of ​​"adult" movies, many unpleasant words with the mood of the bathroom thrown in? I thought better of him and I think less of him for this movie. <br /> <br /> Falk's acting and some moments of humor, as well as some possibly important themes, are what made me give such a high note. <BR> This can be a good movie for grown children to watch and laugh about their own friends and their weaknesses. But the lack of consideration by the public's families seriously undermines what might have been a family film, but fails. It certainly is not worth spending money, although it may be worth watching for free on television.
