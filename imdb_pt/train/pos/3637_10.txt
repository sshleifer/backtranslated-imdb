This was a really great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very nice actor who is a lot of fun to watch. The chemistry that the staff had since they were together was spectacular, it just shows what you can do when the minds come together as one with a goal. This team has returned from the limit, having several losing seasons to win almost everything. I love movies like this because they are really very inspiring. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid has achieved a place in the major leagues. You can not do anything but cheer for this guy. It seems like when someone should do something, they will do it. Things just happen and make everything clicked. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really make you think of the fact that "nothing is impossible".
