Excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other films of higher rank in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to skip these incredible performances at the top of their career? A history of friendships, parent-child relationships, corruption and deception. The two actors gel incredibly well together, and Aiello and Fonda's supporters are equally impressive, though Aiello is brilliant, especially when the newspapers run to print. Instead of focusing on an overly complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure a political bribe. The final scenes with each of the main characters are beautifully written and put into action.
