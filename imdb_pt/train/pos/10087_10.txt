Fabulous costumes by Edith Head who painted them in Liz Taylor at their best! SFX is very good for a movie of its age, and the stuntmen looked even the actors, even with the body type. , a rarity in films of this vintage. <br /> <br /> A cozy film with splendid panoramas - even when cut to make pan and scan.
