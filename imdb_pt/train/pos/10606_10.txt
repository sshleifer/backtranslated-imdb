I just watched this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a small, quiet movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It simply takes you into the lives of people living in a small village in the hinterland of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a lonely young man who finds an abandoned baby in the woods. Toker's quest for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimy con man with a hidden motive. And David plays the bad guy to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this film than the first encounter with the eye. Filmed on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it's worth watching.
