I've seen hundreds of silent films. Some will always be classic (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them, my favorite is this movie (may not be the best - but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I searched for IMDb, I realized that I immediately laughed at me because the movie was so cute and well done. Marion Davies proved with this film that she really had great talent and was not a lover of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> The story involves a Georgia hound coming to Hollywood with all the expectations that she would be an instant star! His experiences and the interesting appearances of the stars of the time make this a true delight for movie buffs and a must see!
