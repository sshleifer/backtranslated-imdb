In Manhattan, middle-class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four-bedroom rented apartment and a bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency that collects $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees an ad for a huge home for sale in the country of Connecticut for an affordable price, he drives with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer, Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a known engineer to inspect the house, and the man says he should drop the house and build another. Jim checks the information with other engineers and they all condemn the place, and sooner he finds out that he bought a "cash hole" instead of a dream house. "Mr. Blandings builds his own house" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and high-level script. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man driven by the impetus to realize with the American dream of owning a huge house that thinks that he made a bad choice, losing his touch in his work and feeling envious of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked on a very funny film visibly inspired by this delightful classic, "The Money Pit". My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Home, My Torment"
