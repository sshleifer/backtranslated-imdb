This is a good job. Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest everywhere. Its main drawback is that it looks like it was made for TV: full screen, and although there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy came close!). Strange as well, since Netflix shows that it was classified as R. <br /> <br /> All in all, very encouraging, and I wish Alicia Silverstone would make more movies like that. A reviewer for Netflix said it was part of a series, but I could not figure out what that series is. I'd like to find out, though, why this movie was really good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/8/2005
