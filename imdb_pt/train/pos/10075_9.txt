"Masks" is a moving film that works on several levels. In its simplest form, it is the haunting story of a street artist who relates to a small child while trying to convey his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although history sometimes makes the old man a job, is so well worked out (written, represented, directed, marvelous values ​​of production), it is easy to go beyond his suffering. And, if you stick with it, the film is very sweet and uplifting. Kudos around. This is a wonderful movie for children and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who do not like foreign language films to see it!
