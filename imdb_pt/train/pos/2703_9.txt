I'm not a big fan of kitsch camp and the "so bad it's good" type of viewing. However, I really like this movie for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is unlimitedly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered steering taking full advantage of the clowning and styalised motions. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson on how to use the movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie, you may not enjoy it, but if you have the chance to watch it, then save time because you're likely to end the movie with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some great stars. Highly recommended.
