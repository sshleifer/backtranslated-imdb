This is one of my all time favorite Govinda movies and best movie of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job directing this movie, it makes fun and adds family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this movie she is a little less boring but still bothers in some scenes. Kader Khan is a conductor in performance and still gives a superb performance. Aroona Irani is amazing as mother and gives excellent performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as the companion of Nandu. This movie has comedy, action, family drama and novel a complete artist.
