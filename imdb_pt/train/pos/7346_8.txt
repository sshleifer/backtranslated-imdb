When I saw this animation for the first time (I was maybe 15 years old), I was really impressed! It has completely different style compared to the animation of Japan and I like it more. Any movie impression is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not so ... colorful. The characters do not talk much, there are no long, boring conversations about this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark images, visions of strange animals and a sense of magic, it looks like one of those old Scandinavians. stories, violent and hideous creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, thrones, orks ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil ...
