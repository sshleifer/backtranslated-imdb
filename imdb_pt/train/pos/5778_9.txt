Despite its budget constraints, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The opening, in which rock paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived the age of humans, is a beautiful red herring. After that, a meteor descends into a lake and causes heat, which in turn causes the outbreak of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps cave paintings suggest instead that this is not the first time this has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a very lively Plesiosaur who is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a genuine entertainment for fans of movie monsters.
