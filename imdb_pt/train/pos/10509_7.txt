I have not read the novel, although I understand that this is a bit different from it; the fact that I liked it a lot, along with the fact that this is not my genre, leads me to the decision not to read the book. Not having read a single word from Austen's writings, I really can not compare this with any of his works. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue is intelligent, witty and well made, as well as the greatest source of comedy in that sense. It made me laugh really loud, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is perfect, and Paltrow fully appreciates the role of a matchmaker. The characters are well written, reliable and consistent. I found some of them extremely annoying, though, and although I find that at least some of that was supposed to be funny, it tended to be overly repeated, and honestly it was not fun the first time they showed up. The issue and the cinematography are wonderful and everything seems absolutely gorgeous. The plot and rhythm are great, you never get bored. This ends in a * really * obvious way, but maybe that's what the audience prefers. I can not say that it did not amuse me from beginning to end, and I watched it again. There is a brief language in this. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10
