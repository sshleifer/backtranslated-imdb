This movie, over the last ten years, has become one of my favorite pseudo-noir experiences. The three plot threads that are presented to us by Kazan have their unique and separate pleasures. The domestic chat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between rooms, the little gestures like the phone book Barbara puts in the chair under her son to reach the table, those small intimate conversations between husband and wife are all well worked out . it's natural. More than anything else, I love their balcony, the second living room where it's clear they spend most of the summer. The second segment is the professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between the characters of Widmark and Douglas. It may not be totally original and get a little tempestuous, but despite everything, it is real, respectful and efficient. The third topic, Blackie's dirty tale and his tattered little gang, brings us closer to a dark and scary noir world. Palance's Blackie is as cold as an ice pack. This self-proclaimed businessman, this man who made himself, clearly has a complexity that we only hit briefly. For me, this film remains a completely satisfying experience.
