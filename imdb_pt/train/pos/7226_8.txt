A little typical of cinema of this era. Obviously it was conceived in this world for the first time for the stage, but still a very good film from beginning to end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York start making their stage performance for the movie screen and both do it effectively. There is very little history and anyone unfamiliar with this type of character study can be a bit discouraged. After all, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get over it.
