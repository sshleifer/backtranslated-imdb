I recently watched this movie, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a friend of mine and we had so much fun! This movie is a masterpiece of junk. Try to watch for that purpose! It was not to be expected, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low cost budget created an incredible mix of silly things. Tomba just retired from the alpine ski races where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and '90s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships and nine World Cup season titles. Serious about the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani he signed this movie. All other directions of Damiani are considerable.
