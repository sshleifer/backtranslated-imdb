This movie answers the question: How does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is co-dependent, clingy, needy, jealous ... and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women? <br /> <br /> Without ruining the movie, I can safely guarantee that no, but there is lots of fun along the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine, a super-cat, mysteriously called the G-Girl, who unlike most in her fellowship, is not * always * devoted to truth, justice, and the American Way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also believable as the curious Jenny. When she is dumped by a less gifted but more emotionally secure and well-adjusted rival, G-Girl becomes ballistic, and what follows is not pretty. It's funny, but it's not pretty ... <br /> <br /> It's a delightful premise, hell does not have fury like a despised superhero, and those involved do not, but it has its moments, and I think I'll get the DVD. I liked this movie ..
