This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She's not just beautiful, but hilarious in this movie. (I believe that Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career in the style of Davies, which might be called "zany beauty.") Vidor's direction is light but sure, the story is a chestnut, of course, but acting is wonderfully contemporary. and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era, with many appearances, adds to the overall fun. It combines the elements of pasty with adult drama and good old timeless romance very well. For all movie fans who have an automatic reaction to watching silent movies, sit through this and this can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
