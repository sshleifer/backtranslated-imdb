Two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as a Kabal) attempting to destroy Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to save him. "Doctor Mordrid" is a nice fantasy that offers quite a lot. The plot is very silly and the gore is completely absent, but the film is very short and fun. So if you have enough time to kill give this a look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
