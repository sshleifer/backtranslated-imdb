The trailer for this movie did not do justice to the movie. And while the film did not know what it really wanted to convey, being the first half of the film a light romantic comedy and the second a more serious and romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be. be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer has become more of a thriller thriller that never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a lightweight, sensitive, though somewhat quirky, movie that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
