The third and, in my opinion, the best Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy, who was the funniest character in the previous series, but the Prince Regent of Hugh Laurie is appropriately crazy. As a package, it is quality through Regency sets convincing, superb cut-throat sarcasm and little bits of the nutcase, the 'macbeth' actors standing out and Prince Georges' impression of chicken 'lucky to us', and the missing words in Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies have been as clever as funny, okay, the remark or strange line of maneuver comes in, but most of it is a scream.
