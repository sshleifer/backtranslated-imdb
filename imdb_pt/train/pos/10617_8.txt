Linda Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with her team (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have fallen and all hotels in the city are full. So they travel out of town to a remote location and enjoy the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). You do not know, Ernest and his tame partner, Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in his basement: "Junior", deplorable, deformed and with diapers (Stephen Furst in a remarkable performance) that ends up terrifying the girls. <br /> <br /> A deliciously unbalanced Lassick plays the real monster in this small and disturbing horror movie. He builds slowly but surely for an intense confrontation / climax, delivering horror in small doses until the last half hour. The hotel and the wine cellar of foreboding - great echoes of "Psycho" here - are great scenarios. Above all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the film to assume a truly somber quality. And yet it also becomes moving when we realize that Junior is not an indiscriminately evil boggart, but a victim as big as the girls. The final shot is especially sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a small horror film worthy of being discovered. <br /> <br /> 8/10
