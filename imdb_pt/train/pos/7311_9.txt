Halloween is a movie that I have to go out and watch every time it's on that day of the year. I even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday! This movie is so great. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving. This movie may be old, but the story still makes me feel good there, and the acting was absolutely fantastic !!! Although I have not seen the remake, I already feel it was TOTALLY unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie should NEVER have re-created such a classic. What kills me, though, is knowing there are some people out there who saw the remake without even hearing about the original. I'm getting mad just thinking about it !!!!!! was great, and will always be remembered in history as a classic.
