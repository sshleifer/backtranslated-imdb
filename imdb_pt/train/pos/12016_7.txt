Good western filmed in the rocky wilds of Arizona. Lots of tough guys everywhere; Cobern's character seemed to swing back and forth between a furious psychopath and a laid-back guy. Several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to compensate for the fact that it is exciting and worth seeing. A really stupid scene shows Heston emptying 45 boxes of dust and collecting them in a bag for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather so much gunpowder, he would need a mule to carry the ammunition. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not drop a match on it and let it rip?
