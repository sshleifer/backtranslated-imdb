I have not watched the movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I have ever seen: the questions that made me really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the "battle inside" ... thank goodness someone is hitting another angle with the boxing thing. This movie looks so new and clever. And the actor is very sweet. I especially liked the short clip with the Rocky movie actor, really smart. I thought the selected topic - overcoming childhood adversities and traumas - is timeless, and God knows a lot of people need it. May come.
