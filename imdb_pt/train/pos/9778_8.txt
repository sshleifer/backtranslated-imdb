This is a trio of short stories, "Shakti," "Devi" and "Kali," about an experimental community (or something similar) called the Taylor-Eriksson group that drove people into journeys within themselves and into the realm of the unknown , and left a little damage here and there, I would say. Many years later, some of the damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact he was torn apart and the suspect was a man who may not have existed. It seems that this woman is capable of projecting some inner demon, or else she discovers the sister of the man who was killed when she tries to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin." He is a skinhead, a speed madman, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who happens to be a former member of that community, which results in the good doctor helping the young man fulfill his or her wish. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a curandeira, who tries to "heal" this woman who was part of this community and loose some kind of demon that lived in this woman, but she wonders if he did it or if she let it go because he could not survive it anymore. All three of these stories are pretty scary and full of suspense, because you never know for sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are so different from those of conventional horror movies that increase the strangeness. This has a low budget appearance, but it also manages to evoke a rather frightening atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. I watched it with my mouth open for most of the time and when the real scares (and gore) arrived, it was very difficult. I found this movie very interesting and disturbing and I really enjoyed it. A good little find, this, I would give 8 out of 10.
