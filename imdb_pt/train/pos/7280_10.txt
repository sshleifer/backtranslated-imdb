to watch it as a child. Although I probably thought it was horrible now, it was kinda scary, since I was only seven. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon puzzle while watching, so I was not really paying much attention. However, the scene with the rolling stones was burned in my mind ever since. I asked several people if they saw this movie, but to no avail. Twelve years ago, one person mentioned that, possibly, he had seen it, but he thought it was just a dream; a fanciful snare like the wind. It's not a dream, my friend. Not dreaming now. Again, I have not seen him since, but I can not wait to find a copy and put it on my VCR. Anything that might be embedded in my mind for 23 years deserves a '10'.
