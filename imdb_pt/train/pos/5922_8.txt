I found this movie exciting from the start - like a Spielberg movie is - and found the plot intriguing when I tried to figure out what the real situation was. <br /> <br /> start - before the opening credits - the action begins, bringing with it immediate suspense. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very friendly. (I have a hard time liking any of the Baldwins because of Alec's extracurricular political activities, but William was not too bad in this movie.) There were several highly unexpected twists that contributed to the Pleasure. <br /> <br /> There were, unfortunately, many places where there was a loud and annoying sound on the soundtrack - something like 19KHz. I suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.
