When I saw the dentist, I thought it was really cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially for people who do not like bloody scenes, as the Dentist has many bloody scenes. That is why it has the R18 rating. It's about a Beverly Hills dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone, who meets his wife Brooke by betraying him with the pool man. It is best to go to your dentist "before" to watch this. But if you do not like going to the dentist already, then it is best not to watch this because you can stay out for a lifetime. The dentist has the best bloody revenge I've ever seen. Who has seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) remove all the teeth of his betrayal wife and cut the tongue without anesthesia? Overall amazing movie, but not for everyone.
