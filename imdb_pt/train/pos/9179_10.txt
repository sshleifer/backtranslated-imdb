This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most faithful to the work of Bronte. Dalton is a bit difficult to imagine as Rochester, which Jane Eyre declared "not handsome". But her acting outweighs this and Zelah Clark, beautiful as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch, but worth it. Almost direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the first true 'romance' in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and read and reread the original. Filming may seem a bit dated now, but there will never be another like that.
