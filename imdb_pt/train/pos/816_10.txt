First of all, I would like to say that although I am aware of my part about star wars, I am not a fan. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat owns or the extended family of TK427. What I do know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (minus episode 2), have captured something magical. It's hard to say what, the button that Lucas found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea. <br /> <br /> How, you may ask? I'll explain. Star Wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. He does it so obviously, so deeply, that literally anyone of any environment can understand. Episode VI does very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, but also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the suggested back story. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader up front, and viewers realize it's the story about Anakin, not just about Luke. but even before 1-3, there was incredible depth to everything. it seemed real, as if the capsule fell from the sky on Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far away. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and I must admit, whenever I see them, particularly this one, I feel very small. I feel as if I have been pushed into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I have a tingling sensation when I see them, a feeling that something, somehow, touched me more than anything physical could expect.
