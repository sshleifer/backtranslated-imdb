That was instigating! I am Iranian and, living in the twenty-first century, did not know that these great tribes lived in such conditions in the time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see this today, or even in 1925, from one side of the world, a lady or a baby could have everything served for him clean and on demand, but here, 80 years ago, people they ventured to go somewhere with more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians have such difficulties in finding pastures for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. <br /> <br /> I commend the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as the Bakhtiari. .
