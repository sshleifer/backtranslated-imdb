I admit to being a little tired of a little kid's film genre softening the heart of his reluctant guardian. Have I seen enough of them? Baby Boom, Kolya, about a boy, especially Martha, and to some degree, whale? expect to get bored with the formula. What struck me most in The King of Masks was the severity of the scenario: the small Chinese city of the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girls were considered so useless to poor parents who killed them at birth or they were given to anyone who took them to the black market. When Wang discovers that his purchased grandchild, whom he calls "Puppy," is a granddaughter, he initially expels her, even though she has shown great promise as heir to street performance. Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he does not get too upset when she is kidnapped. The film is bold at the time, showing the size that a young, intelligent and street, had to go to survive in that society. <br /> <br /> The two main performances are compelling and seductive in their social context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of Wang's resentment for not having achieved more material success. Wang so fully accepts his position as a celebrated artist with low social status, although I also did. While Doggie exhibits a level of precocity and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely believable in the context of a child constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her seven previous owners have abused her physically and mentally, her ferocious attachment to Wang makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> A glimpse into small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two leading actors, the surprising twists and of course the comforting resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.
