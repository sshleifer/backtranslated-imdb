"CASOMAI" was the last film I saw before marrying just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I looked for, after I got married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the reality is not this other than fiction. For all those who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my Father Fr. Nuno Westwood in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To all the others, I only recommend you to watch this movie, before and after the "yes!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
