Quote from Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Thin film, but DVD" reformatted for TV ", April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and moving film, and on the other hand, the DVD I bought was" reformatted to fit your TV "by the clods at Columbia Tristar.There is no excuse for not providing the movie in widescreen format except that Hollywood treats all the movies as the disposable trash it is so accustomed to produce.What a shame." <br /> That (criminal!) shame, in fact. However, there is another version though. See here for more details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> wonderful performances by the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
