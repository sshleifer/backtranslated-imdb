I was very happy to finally see the release of Amazing Stories in the first season on DVD. I had forgotten what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on in this series. For a long time, the only way to see this remarkable series was with the VHS collections 2 or 3 or when Sci-Fi would run the episodes again. However, when Sci-Fi hosted reruns, they usually stayed in the same episodes. There were some extraordinary episodes in the first season, like The Mission, which they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series has run? He says from 1985 to 1987 at the top here on IMDb, but I thought it lasted more than two years. If you love the Twilight Zone, the Night Gallery and the Outer Limits, you'll love this series and will not be disappointed with your purchase.
