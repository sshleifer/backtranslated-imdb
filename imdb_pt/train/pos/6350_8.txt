I waited and waited for this movie to come out, the trailers seemed to be on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again, but I can not wait for this to come out for everyone to buy! Not a big Jim fan, but that suits him perfectly, there was so much to see and the "feel good" factor is off the scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a fab job turning that into a movie, If you have not seen it, do it, if you watched it again, I know you want it!
