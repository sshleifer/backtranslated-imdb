I went to a short preview of this movie on July 19, knowing no more than the names of some of the actors and that it was an adventure of some sort of adventure. <br /> <br /> The plot really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything that is currently coming soon or in theaters. Despite what first impressions can give, it is not tacky, tacky, tacky or ridiculous, and it's actually a lot of fun and funny. The flow is very well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the movie, rather than simply filling in the silence as often happens in movies or on TV. And even if he knew what was coming, he still could not bear to stop watching the screen; As far as I know, not a single person has left the theater for the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this movie, and as bright as it is I can not figure out why.
