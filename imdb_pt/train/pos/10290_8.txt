Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since The Truman Show, and it was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - Look How I Can Act Well!" disappointments at the ticket office. It's great to see Jim acknowledging and embracing his strengths. He will not win an Oscar, but the film itself will outlast many Academy Award-winning films. He's at the top of his form in this latest movie - it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, superb comic timing, and obviously having fun together but without the kind of comedy "Hey Mom - Looks How Funny I Am ". A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's nemesis (Carrell from The Daily Show), which came out with some of the best and funniest scenes in the film. I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can predict that religious madmen in the US will be holding hands with God's treatment, but the bottom line of the film is true for all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to pass our short lives exercising our free will. Without marrying children to complain, this is likely to become a target for people with wrong priorities (who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and at the end of the television, selling prayers to God). And again, about 0.5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it. The result: This is a purely entertaining film, each member of the audience laughing thinking about what they would do, and a sense of well-being at the conclusion of the film. A walk through any major street in America has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor. What better comic book genius to remind us of this than Jim Carry? <br /> <br /> Thank you again, Jim - it's great to have you back !!
