Yes, it's another great Muppet movie and I love them all; the characters, the movies, the episodes of TV shows (it's the best comedy or music TV show of all time) and all the artists behind it. But here they made a fatal error so rare and I'm certainly talking about the strange ending !! <br /> <br /> I think it's too dangerous to get so caught up in the American drama, and end up with a love affair for the wedding !! We, like all poor spectators, feel so free or perhaps happy for the absence of their annoyance, imperfection, and misery! So we all like these stories that bring together two heroes as a couple in love without the legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous couples and their tastes, I bet you feel safe, serenity and peace. So when you look at what the creators of this movie have done, you're going to be as crazy as I am! <br /> <br /> They made the weak, miserable creature (Kermit) marry his daily nightmare, the most vexatious woman of all time. (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change by the measures of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the public who just refused to bless, believe or be satisfied with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or opportunity to think or decide anything!). So it's no wonder when you know that this movie is the most unsuccessful in its serious cinematic, collecting only 25 million from the 65 million won for the first movie (The Muppet Movie ?? 1979) five years before !! <br /> <br /> Simply in this movie they took Manhattan, and my rest too!
