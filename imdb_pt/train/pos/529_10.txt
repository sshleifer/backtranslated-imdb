This is one of the most neglected gems Hollywood has ever produced. - A young World War II ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young American who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that in a few minutes he will be dead. For some reason, the man who must surely be dead turns away from the wreckage and ends up discovering that he should present himself to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and asks to have his "day in court" to discuss his case. The man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life, that he had fallen in love and that he had therefore become a different person, who deserved a chance to live. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is a cinematographic delight! The "jury announcement of peers" is a definite highlight. The story, as fantastic as it sounds, is engaging and will keep you fascinated for almost two hours of play. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my top 10 favorite of all time, it has my highest recommendation!
