This is one of the best crime drama films in the late 90's. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful plot, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good as long as the viewer did not care for his Louu-siana accent. It may seem annoying if you can not stand this dialect. The way the Pacino character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was excellent as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good, but not memorable. There were times when this photo mentioned so many characters, probably many. It may take a second view to remember, "which Zapatti was which?" After so many cross-references, you have to stop and think only about recapitulating. The end did not have much pain. It was built for so long and then it was a little disappointing. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie was not advertised as a blockbuster big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie still existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of "splash" of the movie in the theaters may not have been indicated. It was semi-successful in the domestic market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Made in 1996, it still holds today and will continue to be popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So make a lemon pudding and watch this movie!
