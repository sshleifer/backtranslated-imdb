The purple color is about the struggles of life and love that helps people strongly affected by the struggles of life. Each character had a purple element in them. The film touches on love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. be Celie having lived hell and lost his sister, and Shug coming into his life to show his love again, Albert not being man correcting his mistake for Celie, Shug avoided by his father and confesses to him in the end, Sophie and his stubbornness well and evil, and even Nettie, they had their emptiness and difficulties through the film, but was surpassed in the end and this is the sign of a good movie. Good job for all cast and crew.
