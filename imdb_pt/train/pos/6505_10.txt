Theo Robertson commented that the WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after World War I, which led to the rise of Hitler and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he lost the first ONE and the FOUR HOURS of Volume 8? Cover this period, and along with the previous volumes of the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I feel. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, joined the Hitler Youth until, and his experiences were very similar to those mentioned in the WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is well above the documentaries of the History Channel I also own, that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The only flaw, and it's a small one, that I have with WAW is this: numbers are not included too often. For example, if you are talking about borrowing and leasing, then how much war material was borrowed / rented? As for Russia, as for Britain? How many merchant ships did the U-boats sink and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese navy have in total in 1941? What kind were they? How many troops? How many troops did the Allies have, in total and per country? Many numbers could have made many spectators nap, but I would have preferred MORE! And of course, I always want to see more military analysis. WHY did Patton and Clark not arrest the German army that was in Cassini after having surrounded him, instead of running from Monty to Rome, and letting him escape? I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you've seen some of those video segments about "total war", like the Dresden fire bombing. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the death camp clips: you just can not get your head around - it's unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time. Of course, uncontested were the cruelest cruelties and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "Flyboys"), and some live vivisection of medical prisoners of " experimentation "without any anesthetic! <br /> Dave
