This movie came out 12 years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something about the drag scene in New York. The drag-learning textbooks do not say anything about these fashion houses. "Great Pretenders" by Anthony Slide does not say anything. "The Queens Drag of New York: A Illustrated Field Guide" by Julian Fleisher, with its flow chart of influence linking Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol queens and the 90s scene - and postpones the film - completely ignores the houses. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we have to a definitive book on dragging performance goes by quickly through the film and does not provide the background information one might expect from it. <br /> <br /> I understand the movie itself, and several articles that I found on the web that this home system dates back decades. The greatest cinematic performance of a member of the house before 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the major missing part of "Paris is Burning." <br /> <br /> The film is valuable because it focuses on a scene that would be ignored. It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals that includes a real-life murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet, but this only happened three years later. <br /> <br /> Of historical importance, but we still need someone to make a book or a documentary that provides more context.
