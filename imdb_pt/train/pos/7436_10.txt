This filmed presentation of "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is a more beautiful and interesting version of Coleridge's haunting poem. Impressive cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world-famous artists, and the superb narration by Michael Redgrave, are well worth to see this excellent visual work. In the television age, such work as this is an invaluable tool to induce young students as well as adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As far as I know, this kind of work is really rare; this is unfortunate. As a student of world literature and as a former university professor and academic advisor, I feel that more epic poems like Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" should be "translated." Although not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this good production without any reservation.
