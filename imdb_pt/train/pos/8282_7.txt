POSSIBLE SPOILERS Most of the film that does not work is Wendigo, and when his title character fails, his movie is not usually far behind him. The filmmakers' interpretation of Wendigo's form is interesting, and can be very menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing murderer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rearview mirror, for example - and the tree shape was actually very good. However, as a monster character, he never comes to life. We do not get many explanations for his behavior, and what we see does not match the story told in the movie itself, or any other story about Wendigo I've read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it is not given enough to do in the movie. When you summarize this movie, what you have is a thriller of suspense with a little supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is good, although a bit cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood very well. The character of Otis seems really dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster of the movie. It might have been more effective to explain his behavior while he was being possessed by the Wendigo's hungry spirit, which would also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I've heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason why Wendigo does not do much is that when the monster costume was built, it got so heavy and uncomfortable to imitate his posture on split legs, the artist had to walk on his toes) that it was almost impossible to run, walk or do anything in it. Thus, the creature's many flashes stopped, and the race's obvious accelerated images. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
