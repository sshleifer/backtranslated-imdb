SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A friend of mine said that NEXT MOVIE was the best film of Cheech and Chong and did everything to lend me and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, no rhythm, really does not have anything that defines a movie ... but it's funny. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show a little heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this small paragraph I put in the plot, but being four fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would normally start a story. I'll just say that Cheech's cousin shows up. <br /> <br /> Was not there another funniest moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? And the rooster? Was it the first appearance of the Pee-Wee Herman movie? You would have to watch the movie for fun. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has balls strong enough to make it incredible, but the movie has heart and hey, my friend lent me, so it gets a 7.
