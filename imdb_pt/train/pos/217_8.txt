THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 film adaptation of Neil Simon's play on a team of retired vaudevillians, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and were invited to meet once again for a television special or something like that. . The problem is that the two still hate each other and do not want nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau's nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility to make this meeting a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a beautiful Valentine's Day for a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly thanks to one of the best scripts by Neil Simon and excellent work by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for that, but I think Matthau comes out with this flick with his impeccable and hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but had no chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; however, in another year, this was a performance worthy of the Oscars. Matthau commands the screen and there is no fake note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene in which he is doing tests for a commercial of chips and can not get the correct name of the product is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy that shines thanks to the unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
