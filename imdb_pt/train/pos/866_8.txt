Put yourself in Carla's place. She is an overburdened, undeserved administrative drudge, which is invisible. You know her: she's trained three of her last three bosses, she knows where all the bodies are buried and she might even look at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. Always having time for another unpleasant and better task than most, despite a serious disability, she has the table on the way to the bathroom, which becomes the repository of half cups of coffee, begging to be poured. What? Do not you want to hear? Well, she can not and neither can you until her hearing aid is in place. Get ready to experience life from the point of view of the hearing impaired. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work is getting nowhere; friends rely on it to satisfy their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that passes almost unnoticed. She does not take a vacation - a contract is getting critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla submits demands that convey her real needs: a man "well cared for". This brings a candidate for approval who reminds us that we must be careful about our desires. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) has done everything wrong since the beginning of his job interview and his engagement clearly demonstrates Carla's interest in his non-work-related qualities. She sees potential in this old thief, and as the story unfolds, her relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependency. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside the prison walls and finds himself in another type of prison: one of the variety of office and another of servitude hired to pay off an old debt. Her thief skills help Carla win a political battle in the office. But Paul sees a great opportunity with Carla's ability to read his lips and draw her even more into a world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal noir movie with no rating and probably suitable for older teens. Carla grows more powerfully, professionally and personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us. She grows up as a woman discovering her sensual side as she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are made for each other in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla will remain in his role of doormat. She has our sympathy, hopes and best wishes, even if she does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, clumsy adjustments of your hearing aid, muffled sounds, everything but inaudible without it for relatively distinct voices when you can see who is speaking. With a great sense disabled, we see the high intuitive power of Carla to compensate. And we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say but also what they really mean.
