It's not the worst movie of all time, the actors are not blabbering and the script and director are not completely inept. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever, the actors are not great and the script and director are not completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. A fun place. A nice, well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> No need to say "do not take it seriously" or "so bad it's good" or "it was not scary". None of these comments is relevant. <br /> <br /> The cut has atmosphere. It's that atmosphere that's really unique and the really original aspect of the movie, which personally is what makes the movie for me.
