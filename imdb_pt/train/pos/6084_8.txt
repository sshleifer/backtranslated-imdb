I was pleased with the cast of respectable players. The story is to defend a cause, even if you are at personal risk in doing so. In a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of the film, this film focuses on the good old cop. Although similar plots have been made repeatedly, these guys do well. Relax and enjoy. Dennehy is a master of taking on a movie.
