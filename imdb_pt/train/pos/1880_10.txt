Dudley Moore is fantastic in this unknown classic. This film is a very witty film that depends a lot on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minelli and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well filmed and sometimes has a very tacky song that tries to force a mood (the "psychotic" song in the marriage fight), but the acting surpasses it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But it develops well in a more mature and well-rounded character as it learns to live by its own volition. The ending is pretty tacky, though. I will not give up, but could be improved. Worth seeing many times.
