Rated E (Contains Violence). <br /> <br /> I've had the original spiderman game for the PC for a couple of years now. I have not yet hit because in Windows XP there is a flaw in one level that I can not be beat because of it. , be warned if you have XP.Mas, for those who do not have XP, try this game.If a fun family game clean with action and great for any fan of man-orange.In the game you play Spiderman and you face several criminals who commit crimes. Spider-Man is a fun game and I recommend it to any Spider-Man fan or a parent who wants a clean and fun game for their kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
