This is one of my favorite movies of all time and although it may be too slow for some, it's worth seeing it. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is drawn into a case involving Aboriginal "city", and this is not a common case. OK, a man died, but it was not exactly a normal murder. There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately, and the atmosphere in most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill grain. This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about the Aborigines "City" versus "Tribal," and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal forms. Uh huh. Chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what is happening, although no matter how many times I have seen it, I can not quite understand the connection. This is a very strange and scary movie, and is a good example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nowhere. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but I understand literally, it's the easiest and most frightening way out. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
