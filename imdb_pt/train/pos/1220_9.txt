Origins of Affectionate Bears and their Cousins. If you have seen the original movie, you will notice a discrepancy. The cousins ​​are raised with the Sweethearts instead of meeting them later. However, I have no problem with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. Babies are adorable and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a deliciously threatening shapeshifter. I could have empathy with the three kids, since I've never been good at sports either. Cree Summer is great as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or liked the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10
