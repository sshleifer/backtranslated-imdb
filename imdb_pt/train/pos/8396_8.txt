Sensual and resistant Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends half the day and night with him. It's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to war and then to prison. She continues her life, becomes a successful businesswoman who is not only sensual, but smart, ambitious, and willing to use sex when or where she needs it: "I do not know anything about business, but I know what German women want You might even say that I'm an expert on it. " While rising to success, she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and convinces herself that everything she does? is for him, for his future happy life together. Maria Braun's style is very reminiscent of the melodramas of Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk, and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines through all the scenes of the film and she is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
