Very good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to hit the lady, why not go out and let the cops try to figure out what it was? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths you have to worry about being silent. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit on a chair or say a word? Are there really cops out there who are wise snitches, chewing gum, smiling chimpanzees who approach a suspect in such a simplistic manner? This probably played well before the wheel was invented, but it is so tacky and unbelievable today. Take Elisha Cook's Maniac Battery Stop; his frantic hammering never matched the recording. Her crazed facial expressions compensated for off-stick synchronization.
