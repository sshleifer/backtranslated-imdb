The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and knew very little about it until I was asked to watch the movie. I wrote to some producers who sold it without letting me know. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I could hear about it. I had written only a first draft, so I was understandably concerned when I found out I was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if he would have me do another sketch. I also asked if I could see my original script because I lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name. I had no idea what they might have done in my script. So I was invited to see the movie finalized. I was so impressed that I quickly asked to put my name back. It's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do a lot more work; maybe if I had, it would not be so good. Would I love to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I would also love to see the movie again, I only saw it once at a small theater show in Soho.
