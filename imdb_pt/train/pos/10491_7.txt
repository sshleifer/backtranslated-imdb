A delightful gentle comic gem, up to the last five minutes, which degenerate into British TV farce run. The last five minutes cost me 2 points in my standings. Despite this great plot and flaw in style, it is worth noting the character's performance and the unique setting of Cornwall. Lots of bits to savor, like the tense eternity we all spent waiting for bank approval after the clerk stole the credit card ... got spicy when we're not - pretty sure the card is not at the maximum.
