I knew about it as a program similar to Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on DTT, and it's the same, just more extreme. Basically, three Welsh guys and a British madman were united by the love of skateboarding, and a total disrespect / masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They vomited, ate pear-covered pizza, jumped on nettles, bare paint, jokes on the smaller guy while sleeping / snoring heavily, stunts in a workplace, Army, cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves. Starring Matthew Pritchard who does almost anything, Lee Dainton also likes anything, Dan Joyce (the Brit) who hardly does much physical and has an OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but is more popular by be short, fat and lazy. It was the number of something in the 100 best funny moments. Very good!
