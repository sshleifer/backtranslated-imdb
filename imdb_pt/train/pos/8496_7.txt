Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie. Watching in 2008 is certainly different from watching it in 1986. Initially, I did not think I could get through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so unfriendly, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it difficult to see him. It incorporated all the negative stereotypes of Americans. If that were not enough, since the thinnest workers in the small American city showed that the image only got worse. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese were presented as robotic, emotionless workaholics. The movie was not even so funny, I just stayed there because of his nostalgic value. And I'm glad I continued the clock. <br /> <br /> Just like in boxing, judges are influenced by how you end the round. This movie was about three for the seven that I evaluated because of the ending. The ending was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and that was just it. It was great that the city had to keep jobs and keep the factory, but what was more special was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.
