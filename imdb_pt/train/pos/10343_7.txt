The "Incredible Mr. Williams" stars Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. Her co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five films that year, three of which they did together! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams, and he and his colleagues are presented with a dead body, and they must find out what really happened. Viewers will recognize their co-workers - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always held positions of authority ... senators, bankers, police officers. This dunnit has a touch of comedy for it - the cops are always throwing punches at each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. Some fun jokes - Williams even takes the man they held together with his girlfriend. There's a lot of fun here, so go through the slow start and wait for the funniest things later. I do not want to give any spoilers, so you'll have to pick it up at Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall did almost every comedy and was involved with Lucy at some point.
