This is a great game! Okay, maybe it does not have some of the features it should have, but Digital Anvil still has a good game. There is a certain resemblance to Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and carry destroyed ships, participate in missions), however, this game features a highly scripted mission. It's a great mission. The control system is different, it uses the mouse! You basically fly in your spaceship around a system and climb up your path! The game features some very good graphics, even if it was made in 2003. It should run well even on a modestly specified PC. The story features a great performance by John Rhys Davies, George Takei and Jennifer Hale (she appears in all computer games). Keep the story better and better as you continue. There is even a race section, where you and an opponent have to run around on their ships around a course (this involves you going through rings). This section took me a while to knock. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit difficult here and there, but overall you can win this game. The game has an active mod scene on the Net. Take some mods to extend the game. I have not played any of the mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a sequel to that was canceled, a shame!
