After seeing several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the shape of a truly original concept - and yet they can just - almost - make it work. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is good! Male actors are fairly proficient in their professions. Most of the characters are well-designed, with special compliments to the hero and his more than pleasant side kick. And most of the plot's seem to be palatable. So, what could be wrong? How about the female characters and the cosmetically perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. <br /> <br /> Producers insist on portraying the female characters in this series - almost good - in a way that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> Episodes fall all sides whenever the guest star or recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are totally unbelievable in their roles, and you do not need to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments. A blind person might say. Just listen to them talk. They deliver their dialogue with all the drama and effect of a 16-year-old teenager at the high school prom. Who would believe that these women are scientists, senators, company executives and doctors? <br /> <br /> If producers have the choice of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who to choose - every time? Of course, the series suffers from this. What a pity!
