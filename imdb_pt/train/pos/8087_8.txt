There seem to be only two types of comments from this movie on the net. Those who hate him and curse the name of Ralph Baks and those who love him and call him genious work. I'm inclined to be in the middle. I'm forced to agree with most of the criticism of this movie (for example, the cruel cut of the story, poorly rotoscoped charecters, about acting etc ...) But despite this I still love this movie. Rotoscopy (when done correctly) adds a realistic dimension to the characters and the final battle scene at the end of the movie is fantastic. Surrealistic scenes when the nineriders pursue Frodo are elegant and well executed and the musical track ... magical. Unfortunately, the bad points, but if you can skip it, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (Undoubtedly, I'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this movie after writing this. <br /> <br /> Review, oh well, such is life)
