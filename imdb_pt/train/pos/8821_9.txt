The question is: can such a fun movie be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I caught this at a video store used for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron has been highly regarded as a quality brand since I got the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We were not expecting a movie as full of victory as this was. His basic plot as follows: Grange, this goombaesque bandit on planet Earth, steals "the moon's edge" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I can not even remember the name of the planet) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. The "governor" of the colony and the owner of the mine are exploring prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three across the planet) remembers the prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one space shuttle around the planet and they would have him to deal with. Then there's the nameless "colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a recurring and haunting nightmare. Much of the film revolves around pursuits of "futuristic" cars (dunebuggies with plywood on the sides) with explosions in abundance. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of the other dusty outposts of the Inland Empire. But what makes the film really shine is a surprisingly impressive soundtrack to various mid-'80s Los Angeles punk bands. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack has been pressed for vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie only for the soundtrack. I do not even remember the band names (they're listed on the credits) plus Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I've heard of before watching this movie, but I'm definitely looking at it. Basically, the movie is definitely not a Waste of your time and would be best appreciated with a pack of 12 beers and some of your closest friends.
