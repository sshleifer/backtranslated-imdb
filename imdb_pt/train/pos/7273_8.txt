Carlos Mencia was excellent this is special time. He was working hard to show everyone that he was the real deal. I know people said he stole material in this special, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy in front of the way he wants, not as someone else wants, that's why he's so good. People say he's not funny because he says Dee dee dee too much, and they still do not realize it's part of his act, and they do not want it that way, but he brings it anyway, and manages to make people laugh. For all those who hate out there, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no sense in trying to overthrow him.
