Set in a middle-class neighborhood in the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s, this somber comedy with a light touch toys with American obsessions like gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposal of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me, it's almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are prominent among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as who will become a zombie (90% of Willards choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns as many zombies to make their bids as robots (they have become a social status mark)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can be resolved between the living and the types of dead reincarnated? Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who has also co-written the animated screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this material unlikely going through an hour and a half without hesitation for lack of a laugh good. Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the directors, assisted by the young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent good-hearted kid who acts as a fair witness to all the madness of adults. (Having seen it only in "Memento" and "The Matrix," I had no idea that Mrs. Moss had great comedians). <br /> <br /> Production design and music are exquisitely from the fifties, on a t-shirt. . Maybe this is not for everyone. It will certainly be a tough movie to beat for my annual Bizarro award. But smart comedies that keep funny from start to finish are among the hardest-won accomplishments in filmmaking. For me anyway, "Fido" is a joke! My notes: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Seen on 1/30/07)
