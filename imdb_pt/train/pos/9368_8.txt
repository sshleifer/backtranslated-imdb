I just got back from a session a few hours ago, and I was really happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense, and the closest I've come to crying in a movie for some time. That's a credit to Adam Sandler, who does a magnificent performance on many levels, and who probably deserves an Oscar if he does not leave earlier this year. Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance by throwing the man straight so Adam is disturbed. <br /> <br /> There's some humor but most of it's really just funny compared to the tearful moments as Adam handles his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable he is funny and friendly, but when he is, well, less stable he is powerful and somber. <br /> <br /> I recommend it for those who like intense things. mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss.
