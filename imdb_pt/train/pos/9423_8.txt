I can not say whether the postwar WWII British comedies produced at Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not, but I'm completely addicted, and White Man is one of the best. There is no need to enter into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealist Sidney Stratton in pursuit of his vision of polymer provide a comic delight. Many of the familiar faces in the world of British actors-the nervous Cecil Parker, the delicately dishonest Michael Gough, and the merciless Ernest Thesinger-performed terrific performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is a delight when Daphne (as she spells the word "daddy", makes the whole film worth). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!!"
