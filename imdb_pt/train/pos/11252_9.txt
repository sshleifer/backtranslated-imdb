This is my second time in A Perfect Spy. I watched it two or three years ago and enjoyed it. I still like that. It is natural to compare it with the other great series of Beeb's Le Carré, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" spy game; The Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person is a spy. There are a number of themes that these films share along with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - that creates a multidimensional space of true vs. false, inside out, love against responsibility. In a way, these characters are happier when they are being treated with more contempt for those they love and respect - "stabbed" in their various nuances. <br /> <br /> The theme of parents and father figures is also important. . One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character of Magnus' main character, ersatz father. Throughout history, he betrays and is betrayed. A ladino who can always climb back when he is knocked over, who seems impervious to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet: "Do you love your old man?" and never, "Do you love me?" Maybe say it somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another theme is that of malignity. The nature of business is to transform others - to turn them against your government, against your friends and associates, to turn them against your values ​​and beliefs. In each of Le Carre's films I've seen, The Spy Who Came from the Cold, Mirror's War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley People, and A Perfect Spy, turning and being transformed is the basis of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films, there is usually only a single shot, or maybe two shots to record the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always just below the surface. We see their results not as streams of blood or prison cells, but in the objects to which the characters of Le Carre cling when they are ineluctably sucked into the swamp. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movies above, and you like a perfect spy, you're in for a surprise. I also recommend the Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV), the second and third seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity. The IPCRESS Archive and the Burial in Berlin are good, though mild. For political intrigue try a very British coup, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only one Brit were willing to do The Three Kingdoms, there would be a movie with intrigue and complexity.
