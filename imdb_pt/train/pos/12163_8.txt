I found the film quite expressive, the way the main character was lost, but at the same time much clearer about certain things in life than people who mocked him (his apartment colleague, for example). He was tortured and you loved to see him being tortured! had this perverted side that was scary, but we were all happy to see it come out of misery again. <br /> <br /> It was like a game character or panah through a mining land or to the enemy and we love to see him under a sniper or fire attack, but in the end we were happy to see him survive .. . <br /> <br />.
