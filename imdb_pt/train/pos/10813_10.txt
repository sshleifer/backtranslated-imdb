I'll turn this over to see the incredible Ethel Waters whose autobiography I'm reading now. I admit that my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references began to appear, but people can not look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece. It's practically a short film made by blacks, blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was fairly segregated and the stereotypes for the people involved were the jokes of their day, old, over-hyped tendencies. We see modern black movies doing the same thing, but with the new trends (stereotypes), "ho's" and the "hood" and such. I think if you look back in eighty years, you'd think today's movies will seem racist. What viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and the little Sammy Davis Jr., who plays his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks remarkably the same facial as an adult. Everyone involved in this movie clearly had a lot of fun doing it. Why not take advantage of what it is instead of what you think it should have been?
