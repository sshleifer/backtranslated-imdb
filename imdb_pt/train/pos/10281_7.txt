Here is my first film directed by David Mamet. Adequate since it was the first too. <br /> <br /> The story here is patchy and moves like any movie, from the small cons to the big cons, to the sweeping blow. It's like "The Grifters", but without the level of performance of the film. (In that film, John Cusack was a bit of an outsider, but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flattened (I sometimes wondered if Crouse's gentle acting was supposed to be some kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never looks very good, but it evolves beyond the painful reading of the line after ten minutes. At the beginning of the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - as she reads them - sound as if they were monologues or internal narratives, which they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna, things increase. <br /> <br /> Dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I was expecting lines that touch the things that come out of the tongue, but these do not. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet has evolved after this movie and let go, but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words. He is very precious to them here and, as a result, they lose their rhythmic and jazzy quality. What's more strange is that, in addition, the movie does not look or looks like a game. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked a lot like cinema, but in that movie the actors were not only realized but relaxed and free. Everything flowed. <br /> <br /> I would not mind much if it sounded like movie characters talking movie lines - or even playing characters talking lines of play - but here it sounds like movie characters (or even books) speaking game lines . It's an odd mix of theater and film that just does not work. This does not mean that the movie is bad - it's not often it's extremely fun. The best piece is in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's a standard movie: the new guy (in this case, the girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the dark world. How she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help you with her gambling debt, so she joins The House of Games, a grim playroom where crooks work in a back room. I'll admit the setup is pretty unlikely. (They were just waiting for Crouse to come in. Were they waiting for her to make a check? Billy was in it? One of those questions is definitely answered by the end, though.) <br /> <br /> And from here the cons begin to leave. I found the beginners - the little apprentices - to be the most fun. We're having a lesson in con's art as much as Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see the ending coming, and then we did not see the second ending coming, and then the real ending that I did not see coming, but maybe you have seen. The ball continues to jump back and forth, and in the last scene of the film, we realize that the second Crouse entered the House of Games and found its true vocation. <br /> <br /> I will forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the odd line reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie looks stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark, you really get a boost. If you want a fun movie con, then here it is. If you want Mamet, go watch "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley made it better. ***
