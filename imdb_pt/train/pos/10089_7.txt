. . . or typing on a computer keyboard, they would probably give that movie of the same name a "10" rating. After all, no elephant is shown being killed during the film; it is not even implied that anyone is injured. On the contrary, ELEPHANT WALK master John Wiley (Peter Finch) complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms - however menacing - without a government permit (and his tone suggests that such licenses are not within the realm of probability). Moreover, the elements conspire - in the form of an unusual drought and an epidemic of human cholera - to leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People (as the natives dub it) to close the story. If you happen to see the current EARTH release, you will find that Elephant People is doing less well today.
