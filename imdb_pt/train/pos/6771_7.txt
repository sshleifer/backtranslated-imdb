so yeah, it's pretty nostalgic to watch the first episode because that's the episode that I definitely remembered. I like to watch the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly I like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones right now. I found it interesting that Airwolf and JAG from Belisario had a similar theme - the lead actor (Hawke and Harm) both are looking for a relative MIA (brother, father). I wonder if the personal life of Robert Belisario imitates the theme of these two shows. <br /> <br /> Question - Does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin? I love this cabin (kind of like a dream cabin of mine) and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
