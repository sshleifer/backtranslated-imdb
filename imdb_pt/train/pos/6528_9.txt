I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I absolutely enjoyed it. I love the mix of fictitious scenes done so impressively. It's incredible scenography. The scenes really look like they were filmed in the 1920s or 1930s. And the music is so cool. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience on 9/10. The documentary talks about the incredible bluesmen, with black-and-white scenes of the black man playing guitar and singing. It's really amazing. But it also mixes new bands and maybe it's something I do not like in this documentary. It's the abundant use of links to modern rock bands playing these blues songs in a modern way. I really did not appreciate his destroyed way of playing amazing Blues songs. This is the same kind of perfect musical taste that I found when I attended the Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary was a standing ovation in this first screening at the small cinema, which the next day this documentary was shown to all and normal tourists on the beach of the Croisette in the open air cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor sound quality were likely to make it difficult for the thousands of people sitting on the sand that night.
