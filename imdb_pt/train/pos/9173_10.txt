I think this is a great version, I came here before, to help me find which version I should use and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment from the users comment and then helped me get that version. I do not regret choosing this version and neither do you. I tried to watch all the other versions and none corresponded to it, there is nothing like the book, and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that will match it. When you are looking for something real and moving once you have read the book, it is difficult because you want something that will match that. I would say that God personally led me to this version. It points to true love for a human being. I would say that the love of God is greater. If there's anything better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is no one like that!
