I love this movie. He's one of those I can watch over and over again. He is well played by a good cast that does not go too far to be star studded. The premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to sell marijuana to survive may have been turned into an Americanized turd of a movie or an action thriller. Or he would have killed the movie altogether. <br /> <br /> The film takes place as a comedy from Ealing with a great factor of well-being. <br /> <br /> Worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (no, this is not a spoiler!)
