This film is an exact copy of a TV series on the Indian television channel doordarshan, which aired for at least 15 years. The series was known as "gubbarre", which means balloons. Each episode was a new tale. The story is great and the original is much sweeter and "convincing" Abhay Doel does a good job, but he does not fit into the role of a "normal" and "third class" guys (as he calls himself in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi with short hair and no designer clothes would have fit into the role of Abhays, but Shayan simply does not have the talent to do so. <br /> <br /> I would suggest watching the show if it is available. It's the same story, except for the rush with the mother of friends and the initial introduction. The acting of the TV actors was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason the films are a failure is because the director tried to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) of history to 2+. hours. Then it has to be dragged. Even the songs of nasal singing could not be invented. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and it's really refreshing if you did not watch the original TV show. The script and the end of the series was much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############## SPOILERS AHEAD ######## # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############## SPOILERS AHEAD ############## SPOILERS AHEAD ######### O ending of the original series was much stronger, since the hero himself ended the girl, even if she was willing to marry him. He is aware and tells her that he does not want to be "rewarded" and never helped with that intention. The director or script writes somehow failed to capture the original ending in this movie. The original ending would have bought tears for the girls' eyes and would have made the guys agree. The delivery was simply not right. <br /> <br /> But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy. No credit should be given to the director / screenwriter. The story is incredible and it is from one of the famous novel writers in the class of PREMCHAND MUNSHI. I'm not sure if this is the story of premchand munshi, but many of the other short stories in the series feature some of the major stories of Hindu and Munshi writers.
