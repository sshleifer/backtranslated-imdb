I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me ever since. <br /> <br /> A sequence particularly keeps in mind, and could only have been created by a great director, as Michael Cacoyanis is undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> The context: the weight of history and a powerful army and fleet are all on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. An act of sacrilege has calmed the seas, jeopardizing his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo, in order to win the winds for the sails of the Thousand Ships. He initially resists but arrives and deceives his wife Clytemenstra to bring his daughter to the Greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all the warriors, Achilles. <br/> <br/> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, discover about the sacrifice and anger to the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name was used in this fraudulent and dishonorable way. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> The shot: The camera circulates the two young people without looking directly at each other. They mourn their fate and the weakness of men who deceive their loved ones and covetousness for war. Suddenly they stare at each other, and for a moment we feel their power and beauty, and the undeclared irony-except for the camera-that at some other time, perhaps, they might love and marry. . It is an acute and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant. <br /> <br /> What direction! What camera! What stories tell!
