The story of the thieving Baghdad boy (as has already been written) drew filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first silent version of "Thief of Bagdad" for less imposing and more recent attempts. The best, however, remains the 1940 version, which for its time was a surprising and magical array of high quality special effects. These effects still work with your charm. No less than six directors are nominated for the technicolor film that starred Sabu as the thief boy, Abu, John Justin as the dreamy deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez. like the beautiful princess sought after by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genius is skillfully represented by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar, and when later trapped by that treacherous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly disabling destinations. Ahmad goes blind and Abu becomes a lovely mutt. His adventures through gay Hollywood backlots are fun, but special effects make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from a magical flying carpet to the gigantic genius coming out of a bottle with a black tornado-type swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, made the special effects for the 1961 version of this film.) They both had long and distinguished careers in technical magic.) Duprez is incredibly adorable, while little is called for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a motivated but dreamy romanticism, untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he is very good. For a film intended for both children and adults, there is a reasonable amount of violence, but the bloodless type. Still, I do not think anyone under eight should see "Thief of Bagdad." <br /> <br /> This movie makes periodic appearances on TV, but today my teenage son and I saw him in a theater with some young people present. It was great to see computer haunted kids in a wealthy community respond with applause and applause for special effects that must seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Baghdad Thief" is a pre-war Hollywood classic of a time when strong production values ​​have often resulted in enduring and appealing launches. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
