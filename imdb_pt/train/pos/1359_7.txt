I work in a library and hope to enjoy this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute as her boyfriend (he could not act, but when you look like him, who cares?), But the movie was bad. It was not funny or cute or much of anything. Posey kept the film afloat with its energy. But did she learn the Dewey Decimal OVERNIGHT system and then put tons of books to the rhythm of the song ?? ! ??? Let's go! I also had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full librarian at the end - hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let that stereotype go please? Worth seeing for Posey and Townsend but thats about it. The TV series was much better.
