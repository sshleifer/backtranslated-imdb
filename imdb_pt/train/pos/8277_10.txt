An astounding piece that the demanding horror movie fan will drop in gratitude. Keep your Freddys and your Jasons - this movie is from the same company as "The Haunting" (the original). Lyrical and sincere, he stays with you overnight, much like those terrifying shows from CBS Radio Mystery Theater. A smart rental.
