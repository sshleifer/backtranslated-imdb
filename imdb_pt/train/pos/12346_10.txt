This is a very good and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Great score. I've been to Japan twice last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The camera movement is great as are the actors. He goes deep into his feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind and everything is very well brought to the screen here. The director is playing superb in light colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once you've seen this movie, you'll want to see more of the same director. It's a very good movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
