This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently, I was happy to watch it on DVD, which is a relief when watching old and grainy versions of VHS. <br /> <br /> I had not seen him for years and watched today to surprise me with how well the movie stays up to date. It's one of those rare and perfect comedy storms, where great writing (really funny line after a really fun line) is combined with great direction and incredible performances all at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination. to "Arthur", but lost (although John Gielgud won for best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win an Oscar for Best Actor, it is proof that no comic actor could win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon makes the film wonderfully true to each of the characters and to the warm tone of the story. Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem. It's sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after the release of "Arthur." <br /> <br /> As for the DVD available from 1/2007, it is so. Although the quality of the video is a leap over the old copies on VHS, there is still no widescreen version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some extras that are good, but not enough. An example is the director's comment stating that he wished very much how certain deleted shots and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult choices for a final edit. The DVD, being the perfect format to include such material, certainly should have offered it as well. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.
