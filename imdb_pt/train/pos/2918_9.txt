... I saw this on cable back in the late 1980s as I was a big fan of wrestling since 1986. I saw this on VHS in a 'for sale' box and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a fighter after the Air Force and always saw this again to see what a very accurate portrait of people involved in wrestling was like (families and friends who would not understand us, the travel, disgust, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to see how no one else can understand what a genius he is creatively. A Great Way to Separate The Fonz character he played in Happy Days back then. Also, look at the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and the fighters Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, watch.
