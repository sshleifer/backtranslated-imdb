I really like this episode, Ruth Gordon is good if not a bit hammy like she always was. As has been said, the music is very good, and has a bad mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a big hole in the plot, so wide that you can drive a fleet of trucks it. It is established that light does not work in the safe. Do not you think the very clever Columbus or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the lamp worked? You would think that in the short term they would have unscrewed the lamp and found the note. Granted that's TV whodunit fiction, and several holes will always be found, but this looks very glaring. <br /> <br /> It does not really make Columbus out to be the hidden genius when the light does not work but the testimony of the "deathbed" remains without foundation, seemingly for days.
