Writer / director / co-star Adam Jones is going for great things. That's the thought I had after watching your movie "Cross Eyed." Rarely does an independent movie make me feel as good as he does. Cleverly written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" keeps you engaged from beginning to end. Adam Jones may not be a well-known name yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "Nominees", it would be a box office sensation. I think it still has a chance to be seen by a major audience if only one film distributor has time to work on that film. Regardless of where it ends, if you have a chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
