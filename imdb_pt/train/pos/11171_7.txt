Overall, this movie was great for your time and will be interesting for many future generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate for the book, most things are correct. The film jumps far ahead and it takes some important parts. I found the book and immediately and immediately wished they had made a movie (because I had not found out about the movie yet) but then I found the movie in a bargain box at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if was what I expected. Overall, I give these films 7 out of 10 for their good parts (relative accuracy and generally making sense) and for their bad parts (big time jumps and small, but noticeable inaccuracies).
