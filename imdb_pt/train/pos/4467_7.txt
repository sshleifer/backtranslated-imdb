Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and earned nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a nomination for Best Son for "I Fall in Love Too Easily "sung by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a cute story about Kelly helping his friend Sinatra get a girl and fall in love with herself. Adorable Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with his singing, and we had many great songs and dance routines from Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the art of pianist-master Jose Iturbi. <br /> /> A classic Hollywood song from a bygone era.
