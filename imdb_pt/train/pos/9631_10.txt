A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys arrive to sweep the chimneys in the house of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenating serum. Stan and Ollie continue with DIRTY DIRT, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. So the teacher wants to try on his new potion ... A little funny movie. The ending is a bit abrupt but a lot of the slapstick that leads up to it is fantastic. Especially good is the willpower of Stan and Ollie at opposite ends of the chimney. That's Lucien Littlefield as the teacher.
