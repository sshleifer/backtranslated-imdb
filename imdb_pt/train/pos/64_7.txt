This is Paul F. Ryan's first and only feature. He has not done anything since. However, he got an incredible cast to portray the characters in his story. I do not know when or why the idea popped into his head, but Ryan wrote a screenplay that later became his own directed film, "Home Room." <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps carries the film on his shoulders like Alicia, a troublesome girl; the ones we always see in television shows. With dark hair and black clothes; a bundle of cigarettes in her pocket, a strange look and disturbing eyes (with makeup, of course). An event occurred at your school; A shooting. Some students died and she saw everything. Now Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case and, as expected, Alicia is suspect. But the shooting is just the genesis; the movie is not about the shooting. <br /> <br /> Lying in bed in a hospital room is Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen). She's one of the hospital survivors. The script establishes a bond between them, by the school principal (James Pickens Jr). He's helping all the students recover from the event, but Alicia does not seem to care. She is isolated. Then the director punishes her; she needs to visit Deanna every day until five in the morning. Then the movie begins. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe how wonderfully written I think the movie is. I can identify with the characters and the situations they live; I like reality. These things can happen to anyone. And the things they say are totally understandable. They are growing up and trying to deal with things they have not experienced; (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) are starting a journey that will set their personalities and ideas for the next step in life ; after high school. <br /> <br /> The director takes Christensen and Philipps through their roles very well. Look at the contrast between them. Deanna looks naive and with clear thoughts; without complexity within your mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers, she asks, "Who brought them?" "Many people," Deanna replies; although a few days later, we learn that they come from his parents, who come every week. The parental figures are all well represented, but not as important as the characters of their children. Deanna is lonely. Alicia looks mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking harshly. But after two days of visits, she finds herself returning to the hospital every day; even sleeping in Deanna's room all night. When they both fight later, I believe Deanna says, "Why do you keep coming back?" Alicia is lonely too. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, without spoiling it, is a little disappointing; It's something I was not expecting. This eliminates some of the strength of the film. Revelation is totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax that the film could have had. It was an excellent script anyway; and a great direction. A very good movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Erika Christensen, this was the role she needed to fly higher. His role in "Traffic" was impressive, but that was the big step; the main role. Maybe many have not had the chance to see her in this movie, and that's a shame. She has not made a fake move since. She came out with good performances in horrible movies. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who proved to be very promising in this film (which transformation), does not have many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> The same as I say about Paul F. Ryan. (in the direction of the curse), and I hope he is now sitting at his computer, finishing his new script; I'm waiting for your next movie. I'm hoping for the best for all of them.
