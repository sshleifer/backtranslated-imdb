This is the best of Shelley Duvall's "Faerie Tale Theater" series. The ugly middle-aged sisters are relieved of the quality comedy, and Eve Arden is the embodiment of the wicked stepmother. Jennifer Beals does a great job as a straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming. Jean Stapleton plays the fairy godmother well, although I'm not sure if I liked the characterization of "lady from the south" with some of the lines. The Steve Martin comedy as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is par excellence Martin, but a little out of place in the flow of the series. <br /> <br /> As is usual with the series, there are several ironic remarks for older children (aged 15 or over). With a couple of little bumps, the show flows well and they live happily ever after. Children up to 8 years old will continue to watch it after their parents finally get tired - I found 3 times in a day a little too much.
