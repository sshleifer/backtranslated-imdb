18 directors had the same task: telling love stories set in Paris. Of course, some of them fared better than others, but the whole mosaic is quite charming - besides, would not it be annoying if everyone had the same view of love? Here is how I classify the segments (which may change on a second display): 1. "Quartier Latin", by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors has ever directed my favorite segment, featuring the ever-impressive Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Spicy and delicious. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel" by Sylvain Chomet <br /> Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") story of a boy whose parents are mimics; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries" by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau" of Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mama Also", "Sons of Men"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (playing); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th Arrondissement", Alexander Payne ("Election", "On Schmidt") wonderful look at the pathetic side of life is present here, feat. the underrated character Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely middle-aged American on vacation; 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", a frenetic style by Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run"), tells the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind (Melchior Beslon) they fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise" by Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (another curious participation of Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème" by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but touching story by the talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story. the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "What of Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille" by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underestimated "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy" by Christopher Doyle with Barbet Schroeder (mainly known as the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments as bright and others as average (or even a bit boring), but none of them is simply bad. All in all, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" a 8.5 / 10 and I recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic about love and other things in between.
