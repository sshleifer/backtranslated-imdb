Call me a teenager, but I really think this is a great series. If you did not get a chance to try some episodes of the last Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more appealing than the Voyager caretaker who launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different but strangely familiar ... The music is also captivating. No true science fiction fan can go without seeing at least one episode of Star Trek - and those plots make the wait worth it.
