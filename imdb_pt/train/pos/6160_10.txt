SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I had just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I wish they had left the original version on the DVD. The Portabello Road could have been cut to its original length. It was very long and dragged the film together. Although the dance is great, it would have been much better to leave the DVD as a deleted scene. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a great movie. My 5 year old liked it. And it's wonderful that movies that I liked as a child were passed on to a new generation. That and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just as I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** out of **** <br /> <br />
