Having heard quite positive comments and having seen the trailer I had to watch this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present, it had to be good. And deliver it. Overall, the film is not funny, but there is a scene that really stands out and is, in my eyes, a classic. SPOILER In the end where they break the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington looking at Jeter is just fantastic. This is as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski, where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but he forgets that the door turns out! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
