Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the incompatible pairs who get in the car and run errands according to their need. Morgan Freeman is superbly human, relating to everyone, while Paz Vega is the chaotic box behind the "10 Items or Less" product line, intimidating customers and bored. Together, they explore, discover, and learn from each other. To do this, of course they must be vulnerable, interested in change and have a sense of humor, everything they both have. I would like this film to be realistic, I would like this kind of story to happen more often, I wish we did not have to go to the movies to realize that we can really connect with each other even if we came from very different backgrounds. The film's message is based on the open heart, and it makes us think about the possibility of another world where we meet one another - a world where peace could be a possibility.
