Inspired by at least a bit by the Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, which performed during the war years at the Covent Garden Opera House, this film chronicles the attempts of an elderly saxophonist to reform (almost) all the bands with which she played like a high school girl at the end of World War II. All the short flashbacks from the original band on stage bring us wonderful songs, and help fill the background for the band members, and in particular for the girls' relationships with the lonely member - the transvestite drummer (who is trying Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench present superb performances such as the recently widowed Elizabeth and the conniving and gripping woman Patrick the Drummer The late Joan Sims is perfect as the leader of the band, now playing bar piano on the sea side, and June Whitfield shines like the Salvation Army trombone player. Cameo appearances by other big names like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. It's a joke in memory, with a cast of all the stars I should, by all means, be a bunch of actresses on the hill. All I can say is that I hope to be so well with the Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. It certainly still continues with my wrist! As I watched, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the proper age. Then I looked for these girls and discovered that they were all old enough to perform in London in 1944 (although this may be a little exaggerated for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing bands, feeds on nostalgia, or just want to see how a woman can look beautiful with almost three quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
