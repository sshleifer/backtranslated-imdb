If I had just seen the pilot of this show, I would have rated it a 10. I was immediately connected to this beautiful new world. Subsequent episodes have not quite fulfilled the promise, but I will continue to watch and hope it continues to improve. The production values ​​are incredible and the performance is top notch. I do not mind that this does not seem to line up perfectly with BSG because I'm so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, they're two different shows. I am very happy that both Esai Morales and one of my all time favorites, Eric Stoltz, are back in my life (if only weekly), since I missed them. This is a show that requires a bit of thought from your audience and this is always a good thing. You kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem and there are certainly shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in plots, characters and, of course, in the various virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey is looking like a good ride.
