Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? Schizophrenia relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is a writer, murderer and aggravated drug addict who will stop at nothing to destroy those who are between him and insanity. Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist rubber manikin, Harry begins his killing. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins comes the 1st edition of the vilest story to be filmed <br /> <br /> The only other film that I saw resembling this would be the 2nd part titled Necromaniac schizophrenic <br /> This is a low budget movie and will not be for everyone but if you are looking for something disturbing, different and horrible then this would be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE THE HORROR OF THE MODERN DAY (as the scream) <br /> <br /> The discretion of the viewer is advised
