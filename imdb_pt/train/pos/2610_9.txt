In the ten years since Wildside aired, nothing really came close to its quality in local production. This includes the two series of the fun but overrated Underbelly that have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of Sydney and Melbourne. The Blue Murder miniseries (which was also starring Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception. <br /> <br /> The Wildside is being repeated late at night on ABC. Having not been to the show for a long time, I'm still impressed by its inflexible story lines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later joined Martin in real life) as a community worker battling alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young police officer whose addiction is the game . Equally good supporting roles are offered by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie), and a young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> ABC inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD a couple of years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is beyond me, but I believe it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers. <br /> <br /> A great series that has aged remarkably well. I hope ABC's DVD department acts together. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC message board, some kind of DVD release is due in December 2009)
