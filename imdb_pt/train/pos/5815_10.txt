I was a child .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. He was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago, a friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again .. After many years, and it kicked me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but of the good old days I remembered than when I went to his shows, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me another perspective than when I was a kid. You can actually see the parody that Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson for bringing me back to those great moments, for your great music and dancing. It's a shame that people have forgotten You .. I did not because You gave me great moments with your music .. All the best for you, wherever you are out there ..
