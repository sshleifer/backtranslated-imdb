I can not believe my eyes when I read a lot of other reviews and reviews. Like it was a mediocre movie of some mediocre guys. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, funny, crazy, exaggerated violent, with a minimum of blood and all the way. to the core. I loved every bit of it. I do not remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off. And now the most important thing (at least for me): it is free of computer effects. When I see some Hollywood actors playing on the screen in modern high resolution and damn high budget action "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I understand that any child * beep * can do that - you you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute PC effects and put them in the action movie. Here is different. I do not think there will be a dozen physically advanced action stars around the world that can repeat the fight that takes place at the end of the movie or the play of "Chinese football." And it's just a little Hong Kong movie made for fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars." <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with soundtrack in English is not a problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> I can not fail to mention a neat play. Some of you, suppose, do not like it. As for me - it's incredible. Take a look at the Dragon's friend who is talking bravely to the criminals and suddenly gets punched on his left side of the head. His facial expression turns into something capricious and he comes up to Dragon with a baby expression. And take a look at the ominous size of his mouth - it's almost from one ear to the other when he grimaces. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. . Very grateful to our Russian industry for the release of the classic films of Jackie Chan. Its more modern are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary film in its genre. Thanks for listening.
