Victor Nunez pervades this non-sentimental story of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry rarely seen in the movies. By poetry I mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel were adapted page by page to the screen. In this sense, the film reaches depths that many can not; but it is also quite slow at other times, reducing the depths it once reached in favor of boredom. The star of the movie, Ashley Judd, has not made a better film than her debut here. She fits the role of leading Ruby like a glove, almost as if she did not have to act. She has the presence of a true movie star in the film, and failed to convey the same fascination in her later films, although it has been impressive in normal life.
