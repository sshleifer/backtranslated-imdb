(Question) How do you call 100 film critics buried up to the neck in the sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I do not know Peter Mattei from Adam, but if he's the promising auteur his filmography suggests, "Love in the Time of Money" is a "good start." An elegant filming with whimsical music box style music, this movie looks at a chain of tense relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ending with people A & B in shape of carrousel. The film gently probed the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with finely processed nuances beginning and ending with a street prostitute and his client. The downside of this movie is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical hits it has received. I watched the giant "Angels in America" ​​last night and was bored at the end, while that little concatenation of character studies kept me delighted. Be careful. I may be the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
