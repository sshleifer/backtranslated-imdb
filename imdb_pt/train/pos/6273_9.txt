I really loved this movie, yeah, I know it was pretty unlikely, there's no way the Shelby car could have gotten in the road, just like the 540i with all its traction control and other gadgets, but not the whole The film was well assembled. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also very good, with the exception of Brit Bad Guy, he was a bit "very" much do not you think? Anyway, great movie, great cars and great acting. I at least made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. :)
