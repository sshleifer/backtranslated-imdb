Convincing and innovative! At the beginning of this underrated movie by Whoopi Goldberg, the writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and Orson Welles's 1941 classic, "Citizen Kane." The writers have justification for drawing a seemingly so disparate parallel, but the audience that watches the viewer is often fooled into seeing too much Hollywood to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his subordinates, as well as Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This movie is about finding love in the differences of all. It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-absorption. Who-matched Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex has formulated a duo for ages, with the only justifiable comparisons being Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would like to attend an edifying and celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives; Bergman-esqe, but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be seen immediately!
