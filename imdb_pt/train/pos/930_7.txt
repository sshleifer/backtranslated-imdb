I am sure most people already know the story - the miserable Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three spirits (the Ghosts of the Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) who highlight parts of their lives in the hope of saving their soul and change your ways. The classic story of Dickens, one way or another, passed the test of time to become a favorite darling of the holiday. <br /> <br /> As I grew up watching the 1951 version starring Alastair Sims, and I believe he is the definitive Scrooge, I was impressed by this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a compelling and stingy Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors who play the ghosts are quite frightening and threatening. David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit too. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed, and uses more modern shooting styles (for the 80s) that make it more palatable to my children than the black and white version of 1951. <br /> < This is an adaptation worthy of history and is one I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
