I was too young to remember when I saw this movie for the first time. But I saw it the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see. Now all my family has memorized. We quote at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still laugh after all this time. Of course, it's about a million really drunk who's irresponsible. The main point is that he still has humanity lost in the others we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give up everything for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. Lots of laughs. Your hallarious, sweet, and if your a movie buff, will truly change your "Funny" idea. Watch with a group of your friends or your family and I promise, you'll never have anything to talk about again with a few Authur lines in your head. This will make you laugh for years to come. <br /> <br /> It's really difficult, in my family, to find a movie that everyone enjoys. But this movie, I feel that brought us closer. And I know I'll do the same for you !!
