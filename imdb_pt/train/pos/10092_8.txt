The glittering Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young London girl who falls in love with a tea owner from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). On arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as being in constant awareness of the herd of angry elephants. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat somber and almost sinister tone to this novel, and the setting is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen with black. and themed white mansion and the beautiful landscape of the island.
