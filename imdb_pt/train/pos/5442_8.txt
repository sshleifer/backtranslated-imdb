This is a great movie. In the same genre as the "Memphis Belle". Seen for about 10 years. And I'd like to see it again. There is a connection with the story of the hellish angels !! As the pilot's crew fight the Germans at WO2. And most of the changes form riders for the Harley rs. The movie really happened. Watch the movie! And reed the story of hells angels in hells in hell angels.com Regards Frederik. The story of a rebellious rebel motorcyclist who joins the Army to avoid a harsh sentence of prison after a small fight with the law. Although he is annoyed by Army discipline, he soon shows himself under fire as a daring and charismatic leader of men in a Scout Troop in World War II in Spain. MPAA Rating: PG Runtime: 88 minutes
