This is the design you should have won instead of Country Cousin. Visually well done and much more fun and memorable. Worth to watch just for the music in peace! While there are elements that will undoubtedly hurt the sensitivity of some of these days, the design has to be given a bit of perspective. It is over sixty years old and is, after all, just a cartoon. I am disabled and if I were as sensitive as people who look at things like this caricature and take offense, I would have wrapped myself in a fetal position and disappeared. Sometimes you need to calm down, put your head back and float! Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were commonplace in the 1930s and 1940s and were rarely terribly flattering. Bing Crosby supposedly hated it when it was used on more than one occasion. *SIGH*
