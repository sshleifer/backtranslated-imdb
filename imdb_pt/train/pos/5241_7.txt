Excellent Thaddeus O'Sullivan movie with strong performances from a number of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject and captures effectively the hopelessness and gloomy atmosphere of the Belfast of the 1970s. Amazingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without being drawn into trouble. On the other hand, it deals with a legalistic gang that intends to spread the violence. Very interesting and, thankfully, fun. Do not expect any laughter, though. 7 out of 10.
