Terric movie with a slightly slow start - give it a try to start cooking. The story is based on interest and complexity. Characters and plots subvert expectation and clich√© at all the right times. Superb New York City locations - bold, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the whole movie is an antidote to New York's HBO / Hollywood notion, Sex and Relationships . It's a rare movie that treats your characters honestly and compassionately. LOVED IT! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and his love interest (forgot his name!).
