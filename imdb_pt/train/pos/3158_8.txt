There are many new styles of comedy, but what works best is the old way with a public and internal ensemble. This show from the 70's is a great example. When the show hit the air, no one actually heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, much less the teenagers played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wanted Topher to be by there because the show started over his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland of Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of actors has never been known to us, which is a good thing, because a member of the cast of celebrities can ruin everything. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend, Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the surrogate could not match her and I'm sorry about that. I liked the cast of Tommy Chong as the father figure wasted, but loved for Steven Hyde. I loved seeing Tanya Roberts as well as Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing with Jackie's mother. She really showed off her talent in acting before going on to Broadway. This show was a delight with many surprises. I hope this show will last longer, although 2 cast members are coming out, but I hope they do not stay too long. I would like the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, Third Rock, from The Sun, to be more successful on Fox than on NBC, which sabotaged the show. Turners are not silly and I hope they create more shows like that in the future.
