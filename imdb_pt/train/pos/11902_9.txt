This film tells the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of low-budget horror movies in the 1950s and 1960s that he sold with tricks. In "13 Ghosts" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in black and white). "The Tingler" had theater seats fitted with a bell that shook the audience when a monster escaped to a movie theater. "Marabre" has issued a life insurance policy for all members in case they have died of fear! The movies themselves were very bad, but the tricks had people running to see them. In this document there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors in his films and his daughter. He also gets into his life at home and the kind of man he was (by all accounts, he was a nice guy). The documentary is endearing, very funny and absolutely fascinating. It is very short (less than 90 minutes) and there is never a moment of boredom. A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans. My only complaint - there were very few sequences shown in his photos. That aside, that's great.
