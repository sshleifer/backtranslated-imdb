I've seen Mystery Men polish a little stick in the press and with the general public (take the vote imdb for example), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, definitely wittier than most of so-called comedy movies and very nearly "intelligent". <br /> <br /> The cast is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limousine scene with Ricky Jay is a perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic quality and realism to make him work. <br /> <br /> I admit that the pace is a bit wrong in some places, and visuals are certainly very flash bang, possibly to the detriment of an additional characterization, but at the end of the day, this is the concept of high cinema definition - it's about the little moments "What's Up Tiger Lily?" - and there are so many greats in this film to assert repeated viewing.
