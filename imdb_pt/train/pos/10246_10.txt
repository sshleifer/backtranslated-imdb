This movie has to be my all time favorite. It's not supposed to have a plot, because its creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it was a true snuff film. This was an exercise in visual effects, and it does not cut when the action happens like any other movie does. Movies nowadays are all about sound effects, leaving the visuals to be made by computers, because it is easier to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not get fake blood to look like the real thing. There is no rape scene, because that was not the purpose of making the movie. Have you seen the hills have 2 eyes? The rape scene was funny rather than shocking. Although I'm sure there are some pornographic filmmakers GONZO who have tried to marry pornography with horror. But since they probably do not like making movies, they probably could not do it. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and show everything, even if the movie sucks. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that a movie can not be made without thinking of the money aspect of everything, especially when it comes to an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his series of films in Hostel much better but he has to be very docile to get an R rating ... or at least I hope his films have been harmed because limitations. <br/> <br/> Watch Traces of Death or More Than Crushed Pumpkins if you do not want real scenes (accidents and crime scenes). Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this movie still can withstand most of the bullshit made today says a lot about this movie. That would be like someone saying that the Super Mario Brothers 8-bit sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.
