I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious. Kind of reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is a must see for any 70s rock fan. (I hope my friends and I will not be like that in twenty years!) Bill Nighy does a great performance as the lead singer who tries to regain this old spirit, <br /> < Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the film as the glue trying to keep the band together but not succeeding. <br /> <br /> If you like music and have been to a band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not regret watching this movie. I know I do not know. Even my family thought it was funny, and that's saying something.
