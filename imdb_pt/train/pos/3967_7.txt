That's not among Jimmy Stewart's best films - I'm quick to admit it. However, while some see your movie as pure advertisement, I'm wondering what's so wrong with this? Yes, of course, like The FBI TV show, this is an obvious case of the Bureau doing some PR work to try to get support. But, as the entertainment goes, it does a good job. Also, surprisingly enough for the time it was made, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and "Commies". Instead, it is a fictionalization of one of the first agents and the career he has chosen. Now considering that the actor is played by Jimmy Stewart, then it is certain that the acting and the writing were good - since this was a film with a real budget and a studio that was not willing to waste the star on a third category movie . So overall, worth seeing, but not especially great.
