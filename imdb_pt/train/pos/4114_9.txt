The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in operation because it is the sound a retarded young man makes while operating his imaginary stroller, which is what he does all day. And he is just one of the many strange characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic tale of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. There are two drunks who switch wives, there is a man with aspirations to be a architect, and his little son that he begs to beg for food. There is an old sage who seems to be the pillar of sanity within everything that happens around him, and there is a businessman with some severe nervous tics who has a wife who treats him (and everyone else) as dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no particular plot for this, in fact it is a lot of stories that go from side to side, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. In short, I found it worked very well, and I was dying to see it for a long time just based on its description. I was not at all dissapointed, and I would definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10.
