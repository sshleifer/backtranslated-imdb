This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are hitting this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who tricks a white teacher. A black cop who tells the white teacher that he is wrong to defend the black criminal and the black police officer is right. making the white teacher look stupid. It always comes down to racing. This is a great movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can overcome the fact that there are characters portrayed by blacks in this movie who are smarter than the white characters then you should have no problem enjoying this movie. I recommended everyone to see this movie.
