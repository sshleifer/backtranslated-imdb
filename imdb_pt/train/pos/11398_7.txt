I liked this movie. It was cheerful, nice and very colorful. You can see that MGM was displaying Technicolor. There are almost no colors that do not appear in this movie. Each scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a marvel. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this movie are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the movie, the great dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this movie so special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers had a better gift for the melody. I really like Gershwin's music. Is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyrics writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a really fun movie.
