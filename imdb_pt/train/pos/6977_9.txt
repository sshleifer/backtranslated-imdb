I'm really addicted to Caprica because it's a very good series for Battlestar Galactica. It really does have a slow start, but it must certainly be resumed soon after new episodes continue to appear. <br /> <br /> I heard great things about upcoming episodes and guest stars from season one. <br /> <This Sci-Fi drama will surely please fans who love a mix of both genres. <br /> Eric Stoltz does an amazing job, just like Polly Walker like Clarice Willow !! <br /> Well worth checking !! <br /> <br /> Watch Caprica on Fridays At 9pm / 8pm at SYFY
