Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives out of a fantasy world inside him to recover some of a fallen star and discover that the star is alive, young and beautiful A kingdom whose king is about to die said that the king unleashed a contest on his various sons to see who can recover a ruby ​​first to be king, while a trio of witches wants the star to hunt and use to keep them young. These three plots plot intricately together throughout the whole picture mixed with good acting, dazzling special effects and some solid feelings and humor as well. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun performances from Claire Danes as the star (I could look at her for some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at her with even more magical powers) playing the horrible witch Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate with perfection. Charlie Cox as leader Tristan is affable and credible and we have a great job of a group of guys playing with their kids to be the king who is constantly and consistently trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their roles well in both life and death (they also loved this segment). Peter O'Toole plays the murdering father who is dying and sees the funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything throughout the movie in his brief five minutes. But the real power in the film is Neil Gaiman's novel and script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and works.
