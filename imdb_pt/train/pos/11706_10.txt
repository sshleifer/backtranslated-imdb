For all the reviewers on this page, I would have to say that this movie is worth seeing. So it was made in 1972, so what? The fashion of the film was exactly the same fashion of its time. People who have not studied the culture of decades would think this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left Behind" (which is made for our time now), it looks funny. However, the only shocking part of the movie is the fashion, which again was over 30 years in the past. BUT. The message that is sent in this movie is very powerful and carefully preserved. There is much to be said, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) So get out and see this movie! If you do not like the message you send then you have problems, they need some attention!
