This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts and undoubtedly the best performance of Christine McIntyre with the trio. She is good at several other short films, but here she is absolutely brilliant. His singing is not at all funny, in fact, it is absolutely beautiful, but the plot is built in such a way that singing increases the mood rather than harming it. We've heard McIntyre sing the Spring Voice at least three times, but it never gets old, partly because we're not getting tired of her voice, and partly because it fits in well with the Stooges' antics. The use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of the role of Kitty Carlisle in Marx's "A Night At The Opera", but singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in "Opera" and McIntyre (perhaps more in other presentations than here) exhibited a comedic talent of his own that Carlisle never did. The Stooges buffoonery, the McIntyre song and a well-constructed plot combine with 5 out of 5 stars.
