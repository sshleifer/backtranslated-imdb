We do not have to miss this movie, this is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is incredible (more than usual) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue. Jean Eustache no longer exists on this earth, we only have these black and white images to remind one of the greatest and most underestimated French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I'll never forget that. <br /> Q. Sorry for English ...
