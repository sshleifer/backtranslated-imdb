I desperately need it on a tape, not on a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have a nephew who is in infantry, but has not yet deployed, although he has gone to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved son in Ramadi Iraq on 15-15-05 of a unmanned missile in a green area. I have another nephew who is joining the army as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some idealized and romanticized idea about what he serves in the military. My stepson died after only 10 days in the country and he never went on any mission, so my nephews have no way of referring to any of the experiences shown in this frank documentary of any kind of personal experiences that could have been transmitted by my deceased son. . <br /> <br /> There's nothing I can do about those inside, or now they're gone, but I have one that did not raise my hand and was STILL in. I desperately want him to do this informed, none of the others did. <br /> <br /> It pleases me to help with this. <br /> <br /> The documentary for the movie The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen. I need to somehow make my nephew see what he's getting into before it's too late. BUT: (do not laugh) I NEED my mother to see this first. She should really see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of ​​them, but the truth of what they will be immersed, possibly forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this movie, and once he has it he can make his son, my youngest nephew, watch him as well. So my nephew can start taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> ((Is there another time when this will be shown on TV?) If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is that My mother does not own a DVD player, she still uses video (is that correct? with tapes?) So I need to find a way for her to watch this movie. Can I buy this from anyone on this form? If not, is there any other way for me to achieve this in the form of someone's tape? There is some legitimate link from which I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so, who would I contact? I will be happy to pay for the privilege as long as it is a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I'll consider anything you might suggest. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I have already lost a very precious and beloved, I already know that my nephew will never be the same when he comes back and I can also release him. I can not lose three and the emotional price for all those who return is a very high price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. Please help me. I'll be happy to call you, please email me a number if that is the best way to get the information you need. Thank you very much for any help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Regards, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
