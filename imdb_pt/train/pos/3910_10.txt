So, I'm at home, pitching channels one night, and I come across a man wearing heels and makeup, in front of a colored background on HBO. Naturally, I took a look and decided to watch for a while. I did not change the channel until it was over, it was so incredibly hilarious. The next time it was turned on, I made sure to record it so I could watch it over and over again, and it remained one of my favorite things to watch. For the first few minutes, you may say that the public is not sure what to think, but he quickly conquers them with his incredible humor and humor. While many comedians mingle in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's good to listen to jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians cling to current events. Your show stayed with me later. I went to Italy during the summer, and all I could think about while I was there was like "Italians are always on scooters doing 'CIAO ...'" 10 out of 10. See. You will not regret.
