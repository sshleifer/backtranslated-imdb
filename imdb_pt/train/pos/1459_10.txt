Wow!! Wow!! Wow!! I have never seen a documentary on globalization other than preacher until I saw the MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has zero narration and combines footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China living inside a manufacturing complex. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. However, most of his days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the filming of his work is enlightening and fascinating to watch. The factory owner in China is incredibly open, so much so that it affects the effects of globalization while "punishing" the workers. Following the accounts of Mardi Gras from China to Carnival, the film reveals how the place is connected to the world through humor and interesting and interesting images from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cross cultural introduction of Mardi Gras workers and revelers to each other through photos. Here, the film makes a full circle and shows how the images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never lazy, it is not guided by guilt and allows everyone's point of view to be present. In the end, we - the viewers - draw our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization.
