I can not believe we do not have that 70's show anymore. I have all 8 seasons of this 70's show !! I absolutely love it !! I lay down in bed every night and watched several episodes before bed. At the end of a long and busy day, it is good to relax and have a good laugh before going to sleep. I was so sad that they took the show off the air ... at least we still have the reruns !! I'm hoping and praying for them to come back with at least one meeting ... Like maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally see her and Eric get married !!!! That would not be awesome !!! It would be even better if they continued for several years !!
