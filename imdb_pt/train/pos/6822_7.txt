"Opening Night", released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. He only gets the truly impressive performance of Gena Rowlands. Your character from Myrtle theater actress is not necessarily someone we love in real life. She is egocentric, often obnoxious and makes life miserable to those around her - in other words, unlike some actresses! The myrtle is also a woman on the verge of collapse - we are not sure if the demons she is fighting against are real or imagined, although we are informed of the secret earlier. Rowlands is obviously well-directed with love for her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also has a part in the film. This movie is not flawless - it's way too long, and the last part of the movie where Myrtle comes onstage while drunk is almost cruel. "Improvising" in some of the dialogues - at least while on stage - continues for a long time. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially Ben Gazarra, playing the despicable producer of Myrtle. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I could never figure out why she was in the movie except to placate Myrtle. Watch this movie just for Rowlands - it's fascinating everywhere - and it's hard to take your eyes off it, though you sometimes want to.
