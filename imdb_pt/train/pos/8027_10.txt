When I first saw it, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Throughout history, viewers can expect Richard to actually kill Thomas, or he will do so first. But the main point was not conflict, but ... FRIENDSHIP! An older, mature man prayed to save the youngest who has his whole life to life. It is incredible. Every time I watch, I enjoy it! Of course it's pretty violent like every action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Many thanks Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Incredible movie! I advise everyone to see. I'm sure people will not regret it and really will enjoy it.
