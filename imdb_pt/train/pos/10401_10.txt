Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "The Baghdad thief" was my favorite movie as a kid and never failed to amaze me or charm me. I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it, when I was a six year old boy who had started reading "The Thousand and One Nights". I remember entering the TV room in the middle of the battle of Sabu with the giant spider and being instantly seduced. <br /> <br /> Rarely, so much beauty, magic and wonder have been captured in the film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heroes, Conrad Veidt is completely delightful as the perverse villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genius. The photography of Georges Perinal is one of the best uses of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been acclaimed by critics, but is often overlooked by the public for his notable films, including "A Matter of Life or Death" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and "The Red shoes." He is one of the true masters of the camera, along with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> Like all great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Bagdad" lies in detail. Each painting has its own magical charm. The story is never late, and the characters and their actions are always involving. Here is a movie that will never age.
