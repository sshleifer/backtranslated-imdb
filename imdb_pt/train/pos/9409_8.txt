A chemist develops a tissue that never gets dirty or wears out, but is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries. In this delightful comedy from Ealing Studios, Guinness is wonderful as a moderate but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with his sensual voice, plays the loving interest; Parker is his tormented father. Thesiger is fun as a patriarch of the fabric industry. While telling a compelling story, the film also raises some intriguing questions about science, economics, and politics. He is cleverly directed by Mackendrick, who would make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Phell of Success" later in the 1950s.
