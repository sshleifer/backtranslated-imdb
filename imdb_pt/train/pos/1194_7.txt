The film focuses largely on a stalker Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him. Set amidst a quest for fewer and fewer buffaloes, it portrays the end of a tragic age of meaningless killing and is full of drama and remorse for buffaloes and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his naivety that herds of buffalo will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animal after animal, while in another he kills Indians and then eats the food they cooked in the fire. Under this cruel exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It is not the most enjoyable of the films and it is heavy by the drama that creates, leading to a dark and very appropriate conclusion in a blizzard.
