Forget that this is a "B" movie. Forget that in many ways it is out of date. Instead, writer-director Ida Lupino earned a lot of credit for tackling a subject that at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, this was the first film to address the rape issue and the emotional and mental effects that this crime has on its victims. While much of the cast's performance is at best pedestrian, Mala Powers, who was then eighteen or nineteen, performs well in every traumatized young woman, Ann, who tries escape from their "shame". Based on her work in this film, I'm surprised she does not have a more successful acting career. Tod Andrews, too, has some good times like the minister who reaches out to help her. Mrs. Lupino, obviously working with a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes, such as the search for streets and alleys leading to rape and police training that follows. And she created a bittersweet ending that left me wondering if Ann really could have a normal life again.
