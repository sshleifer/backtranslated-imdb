An American In Paris is an integrated musical, which means that the songs and dances perfectly match the story. The film was inspired by George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral composition. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is interspersed with spectacular dance numbers, choreographed by Gene Kelly and set in popular Gershwin songs. Songs and songs include "I Got Rhythm", "S Wonderful" and "Our Love is Here to Stay". He set a new standard for the subgenre known as a songbook musical, with dozens of Gershwin songs buried under the underline. The climax is the ballet "The American in Paris," an 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron with An American in Gershwin in Paris, featuring an impressionist period dream in the style of several painters, is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any Hollywood. movie. Only the ballet cost more than half a million dollars, an impressive sum at the time. <br /> <br /> It's funny to think of a work of art born on a game of billiards between movie producer Arthur Freed (SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, WIZARD OF OZ, IN THE CITY, MEET IN ST LOUIS AND THE WAND WAGON) and Ira Gershwin. It was Freed's idea to buy the title so he could use it in a movie about Paris and Gershwin's idea that he would use only Gershwin's music. <br /> <br /> The original cast would be Cyd Charisse, but she discovered she was pregnant. before you start filming. One of the main reasons why Gene Kelly suggested that Leslie Caron was the female lead, because he thought this movie needed a "real" French girl, playing Lise, not just an American actress playing one. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while vacationing in Paris, where she saw her perform in a ballet. When she received the call for the audition, she said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, her introductory dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was considered very suggestive by some censors. Gene Kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown when Lise is introduced. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in the part of Georges Gu√©tary, and 'Celeste Holm' in the part of 'Nina Foch'. Minnelli was an innovative musical director with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), An American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used colors and music in ways that had not been used before. He used space and time imaginatively. Best of all, however, he allowed himself to be freed from the long ballet sequences that complete all his films. Ballet at An American in Paris may be your best job. <br /> <br /> Although Vincente Minnelli is credited as the sole director, he was sometimes stuck to his divorce from Judy Garland and other direct projects, leaving Gene Kelly to take on the leadership roles. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Guetary's interpretation of "Stairway to Paradise"; Oscar Levant's fantasy of conducting and performing Gershwin's "Concerto in F" (see why he was Oscar Levant's favorite). <br /> <br /> The sequel to the ballet, now that we know it was successful, everyone wants to take credit for it Freed, Minnelli, Kelly? but before the movie was completed, the MGM office in New York said not to spend half a million dollars on a ballet. So Freed went to the studio chief Louis B. Mayer and got him to agree, New York said no. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the New York office as a British movie, THE RED SHOES used a long string of ballets and this movie became a big hit worldwide? and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film. Well, the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks. There was a pause in production after November 1, 1950, when Gene Kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography. When production for the final sequel was resumed on December 6, Vincente Minnelli had finished directing another film - Father's Little Dividend (1951). Irene Sharaff designed a style for each of the sets of ballet sequences, reflecting several French Impressionist painters: 'Raoul Dufy' (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (flower market), Maurice Utrillo (a Paris street) , Henri Rousseau (the fair), Vincent Van Gogh (the Place de l Opera) and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (the Moulin Rouge). The funds took six weeks to build, with 30 painters working nonstop. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after seeing the recent restoration, "An American in Paris has many qualities, not least, his ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the whole history of his courtship in the dance ". An American in Paris is often compared to SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN as the greatest musical ever made, and one critic put it best when he said, "SINGIN' IN THE RAIN makes me happy and An American In Paris makes me feel good." The ballet represents the fantasies of Kelly, represented by the great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) that he admires. Organizing a screening for the then sick Raoul Dufy, the actor and producer abandoned the final credits. There, relieved, they found the artist, wept, asking for a second help from the sumptuous finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win a Golden Globe for Best Picture (comedy or musical). Gene Kelly received an honorary Academy Award that year for "his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and specifically for his brilliant accomplishments in the art of film choreography." It was his only Oscar.
