I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was not until I watched it again, at age 13, that I really understood what it is; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a true heart of gold "adopts" a girl to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals. The dog star, Charlie B. Barkin, is murdered by his formal business partner, Carface, (who is absolutely devilish by the way). His soul then goes to where else but only to the sky to find a gold watch that is really the time of his life, that Charlie, being the sneaky but adorable bastard that he steals and rewinds, sending him back to Earth . Once back on Earth, Charlie seeks revenge on the evil Carface. This is how he comes across the young Anne-Marie, the solitary orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to cheat by his talents in order to return to his enemy Carface. But the naughty Charlie actually cares for the young Anne-Marie and his plans do not know how to do what's right after Anne-Marie discovers what his "best friend" Charlie has actually used to make money for a new and better casino of the dog. Now he must rescue her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this movie even at the age of 22. The idea and plot are really different and unique from many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the villain for the first time. Carface was even better than in the sequel All Dogs Go to Heaven. In the photo, he looked rather doubtful with his villain role.
