This gripping tale of intergenerational love, envy and revenge was even more enjoyable to watch on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper image and sharper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has some unlikely moments and that some of Manchester's strongest accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even losing a word here and there will not ruin the fun: the primary actors are ideally chosen. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, an aggressive temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls in love with his boss's wife in the hospital where he's just starting to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most impressive women of 50 ish imaginable; she acting rivals her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference is important to them!) Each of the supporting characters is well designed and well portrayed as well. The concise mix of dialogue and passionate excesses makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally upgraded by seeing "reckless" - but you will have lots of fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild and satisfying two-hour ending. You will not want to miss this if you liked what came before.)
