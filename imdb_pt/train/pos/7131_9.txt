This movie made for TV is brilliant. This is probably the best and favorite role of the BAFTA winner, John Thaw (Kavanagh QC and Morse Inspector). Tom Oakley (Thaw) widower lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died, and now he was landed with an evacuee named Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). When you meet this child, he begins to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back. After Tom is concerned that William does not contact him, he goes to London to find him. In the end, Willaim gets his home with a loving family (or father). Defined during World War II, this is an excellent movie. He was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award, and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama. John Thaw was number 3 on the 50 Greatest Stars of the TV. Very good!
