There are many police dramas doing the rounds. I do not know why. It probably has to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area. . No attempt is made to glamorize the police. They are really down to earth, hard at times and relentless, Anne, on the other hand, has a soft heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all the rules, she sometimes withholds incriminating information found in her searches and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a nice movie. Not one to chill you. There is not much optimism about it. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more assaults, more murders, more family disagreements, and more afflicted children. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. <br /> <br /> As days go by, Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and the families they are investigating. The only real heat in the movie is that provided by the character Benny, a 12-year-old boy from a broken family. Anne has her own way of fixing things. She closes her eyes on Benny's theft of shopping and tries to help him in the best way possible. I was surprised that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. She wondered if it was her father's or her own needs. After all, the film makes it clear that she desperately needed a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well shaped but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
