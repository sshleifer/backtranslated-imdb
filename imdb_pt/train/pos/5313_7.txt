Since I'm not a fan of most of John Waters' post-production "Desperate Living," I cheered up with "Pecker." After he emerged from the basement, Waters produced garbage-lite versions of his previous works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", "Hairspray") which for the diehard fans looked and tasted of diluted liquor. " Pecker, "which does not try to regurgitate the initial successes, is a light, quiet and humble commentary on the whims of celebrity and the pretension of the art world. Waters clearly knows this subject well because he also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateur pop art ever created that you could not imagine anyone being able to give unless it was stamped with the name "Waters." Edward Furlong is very much like "Pecker" and Waters's nonstrihed style is at ease with the subject.
