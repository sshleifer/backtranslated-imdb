There are so many things to fall in love with Aro Tolbukhin. In the murderer's mind (Inside the murderer's mind), it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this movie is like a movie exercise, but really great. It's made with super 8, black and white photos, 35mm, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin is like a documentary film or vice versa, whose most peculiar aspect is the doubt that leaves us wondering: did it really exist? The film follows the afterlife of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and then killed some people. An act by which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentarians became interested in this character, so they interviewed him before his death. Nowadays, a few more people have gotten involved and have done a deeper research of the character. The one that we are witnesses of the movie. <br /> <br /> For the main part of the story we are guided by a semi slow phase to look inside Aro's mind, mainly to decipher why he did what he did. However, the important thing is that filmmakers never give us a side view; they have left judgment for us all, and even when we understand their actions, we clearly never justify them. Thus, the first semester is based on the recollection of the information; later things become Aro's childhood, giving the film an incredible new force (even if difficult, never getting weak or boring). <br /> <br /> I do not want to say - and I do not want to ruin anything; So the only thing left to say is that if you happen to get to that movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.
