"Hot Millions" is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the wonderful cast gathered for it. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screen and appears as the key figure of an enterprising deviant. The film, directed by Eric Till, shows no signs of having left as terribly as some others of that period. <br /> <br /> At the center of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, sets out the forms of income tax for the director, who is surprised at the refund due to him for the government. Marcus, who is a genius in numbers, sees opportunities where others do not. He starts working for a company that uses the latest computer for his accounting, but Pendleton is an ingenious man who finds a way to harness the system and establishes different fake accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus gets a secretary, who also has an apartment in his building. Inept Patty is seen working as a bus driver who manages to make a mess of it all. As she gets a job as a secretary is beyond comprehension, but things are never the same in the office when the scary Willard Gnatpole decides to go after her, but is not afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is a gifted pianist and she is a flutist and they make a beautiful song together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and run away with the movie. Mr. Ustinov gives a guaranteed account of the fraudster. The excellent Maggie Smith is also at her best with her opinion of Patty, the kind woman who adores Marcus and who proves to be a genius when it comes to investing the money she finds in Marcus' pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as the American in charge of corporation. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who wants Patty, but can not make her reciprocate. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith whose identity Marcus took over. Cesar Romero also appears in a special participation as an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will delight everyone looking for some fun time in the company of that nasty but charming character, Marcus Pendleton.
