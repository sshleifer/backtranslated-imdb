Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri - directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) to the best existing chambara films. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) working for Nakadei, who wants to become the daymother. Okada, being the "cleanest" for Nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after a while he realizes - what he really is for Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there's so much more in this movie - every Japanese movie fan should have seen !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means Punishment from Heaven)
