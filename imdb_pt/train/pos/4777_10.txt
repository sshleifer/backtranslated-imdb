Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is the most accessible. This time, instead of the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective and fragile meditation on the universal issues of aging and family and finds tranquility in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) riding a lawn mower in Wisconsin to visit his estranged sibling, there are still many unique and original visual landscapes (some impressive aerial heart shots, filmed by director of photography veteran Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable effort by Lynch and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet presentable manner, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns some of his best work into a minor role as his mentally challenging but attentive daughter. The secret is revealed in a touching way through a gentle change in the sensitive script of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast for one person offers indelible performances, being one of the most notable Barbara Robertson, whose accidental death of a deer is both noisy and sad at the same time. But that is vintage Lynch with its ability to engage and destabilize you at its best. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or know him just for his violent and disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start; For those who know his work, this is one of the best in his repertoire.
