When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, in future visions, I received much more than a masterful production of films. This image has a unique voice that will echo through the annals of movie history. <br /> <br /> The opening montage provides a splendid palette that director JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this entertainment screen. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as a brush as he takes us on a ride that engages audiences in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format to which we get accustomed and plunges deep into obscure themes of treachery, revenge. and the importance of fellowship. This film is the dream of any director in its essence. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic endeavor. The writing, provided by the scribe Tim Sheridan, was so impressive. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically speaking, the final scene where Vanessa turns out to be one of the coalitions and a villain all the time is written in a tone so dark that it's one of the most chilling endings I've ever seen . Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In a final note, it is obvious that this production was not easy. So much praise should be given to producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I witnessed such a grandiose production, with so much attention directed to every little detail. Producer work is one of the hardest in any movie and Shipley makes it look easy. <br /> <br /> In short, this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of cinema at its best. When the end of the movie arrives, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is innovative, a masterpiece and, more importantly, the Romeo Division is indeed art.
