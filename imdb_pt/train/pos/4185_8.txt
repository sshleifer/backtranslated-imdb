This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth it - sloppy editing, little or no continuity, insane dialogue, bad (you may even say non-existent) acting, nonsensical plotting, shots that last a long time ... and it's perfect for riffing in the MST3K style, not to mention the "Game of Eating Corpse Eaters": Scribbling on forms ... give it a shot - Sign your name ... give it a shot - Catch a bad edition of Foley ... take many , <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not rate more than 8 is because there is not enough free nudity and, despite its insane malice, it's only an hour - hell, such a movie should have been at least 20-30 minutes more!
