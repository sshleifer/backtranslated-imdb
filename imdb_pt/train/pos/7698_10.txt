But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang is second as a fight choreographer, only Sammo Hung in his best comparison. This is immediately apparent in his proud display of technique - instead of flashy camera angles etc. - during the fights. The direction is tightly controlled not only to excite the viewer by speed and movement, but to marvel at the precise skill exhibited. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the movie opens is one of the highlights of the kung fu movie history. Liu is backed by the handsome and talented Hui Ying Hung (of the fame of My Young Auntie) and 'Hsiao Hou' whose stunts are breathtaking, and preferable to any amount of work. As for the plot, this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge, but with character and moral development along the way, and a more adequate resolution. The humor in this is also the best. If you only watch a kung fu movie, this would be a good choice - it has it all.
