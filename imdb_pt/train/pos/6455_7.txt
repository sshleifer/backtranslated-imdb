I was drawn to this movie the moment I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for a returning child. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a major attraction in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate on why. Maybe it's because of the provocative joke that Lena's character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social commentary, but maybe it's because of the central message that I believe I have the same appeal in all affluent societies. <br /> The message from this movie to me is the same as the movie Titanic. Life is short and, to the extent that anyone really knows it, is all we have. Can be taken at any time. So is not it a shame that we spend a lot of time hiding behind walls that separate us from other people because we are so afraid of being hurt? Tearing down the walls is painful, but feeling alive is on the other side of these miserable walls. Feeling alive is worth taking the risk. Give and you will receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people are criticizing this film for its lack of characterization and other flaws. I say you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Hold on, it is a parable, a fable for wealthy Westerners who are materially rich, but whose souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> So, join a choir or band or help build houses or distribute food to them. those less fortunate than you. Spread a little joy and make the world a better place, as long as you go out and fellowship with your peers. Writing a check is not enough. We are a social species by the way. Even the lowliest of your peers can affect you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Individualism has its place, but it is overrated.
