I read a bit about Che before watching this movie and you want to know something, he was a real hero to people because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other Latin Americans in general! Now, I do not know about the others, but for me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. However, the powerful elite obviously would not go for that. So, instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work, as there were many of his other followers, who just kept going where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As much as I'm concerned and as Che said before he died himself, "If you kill me, that's fine. But you're just killing a man, you're never going to kill the cause!" I could not have said it better. <br /> <br /> But ... EVERY WAY ... that's why I give this movie 7 out of 10.
