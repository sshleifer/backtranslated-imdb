I suppose I always felt that the Hotel du Nord was connected to the studio, the movement of people cars and cameras was very smooth and effortless to have been filmed on the spot. But no problem - it's still a very underrated lovely composition of Marcel Carne. The plot seems a little shaken at times, as if they were inventing as they advanced, but because it is unpredictable draws attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the two lovers are alone in their room are overwhelmed with some rather formal dialogue, but it's all so beautiful falling into any inanity can be accepted. Are these two young symbols of cancerous despair in prewar France or just idiots? Suicide pacts are quite common; if suicides are young and healthy, with their lives unimpeded, would you think of anything other than that they were just misguided fools? Arletty played the prostitute role well - she kept that zipper in her busy dress along anyway! I've only seen a few movies with Jouvet - he's the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is shallow: every time I see your face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> Extremely atmospheric film, well represented and photographed with so much thing that needs some exhibits to put everything in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Fran√ßois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film had a small fun role as a gay man. All in all: wonderful.
