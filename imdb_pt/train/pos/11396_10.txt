Released two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning film has it all: fabulous Technicolor scenery and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, great wall-to-wall music by Gershwin, top choreography, a script lighter than air and great performances by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood does not do that anymore. This is definitely my all time favorite movie, a standard by which I judge all other movies. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
