This is a fantastic fantasy film. One of my favorites, really is so cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who went on to direct Candyman, he made a great start with this film. <br /> <br /> The movie about a girl named Anna, who gets sick with glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper from her workbook and falls into a dream in which the house is real. Every subsequent dream she has is altered by the presence of everything she adds to the image. In her third dream, she meets a boy she thinks she created called Mark. She befriends him and his relationship becomes stronger as dreams become darker and more frightening. Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is an excellent actress and it's very strange that after only one movie she disappears and never be in anything ever again. She really gives a great performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also ace. Much like Broken Arrow, the song is spooky and mysterious. It's a shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on the CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
