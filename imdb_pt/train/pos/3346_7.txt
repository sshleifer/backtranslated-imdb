In the Old West, there are always men who live breathing violence and women who hold their breath. A famous "city dictator" named Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is hired by the citizens to rid the gunslingers (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), baroness of the Baroness. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), his boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the owner of the hall (Ted De Corsia). Clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following: ¨ Warning, the use of weapons or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check all hardware in Marshal's office. Clint finds her ex-girlfriend, a local maid (Jan Sterling) in charge of the girls in the Saloon (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council is afraid of the raw methods performed by Clint. In the end, the squire appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is a tremendously exciting story of a rent sheriff who had just one more murder ahead of him. It starts off as a slow western, but it follows to astonish us with dark characters and solid tangle. The tale is almost bleak, a pacifier arrives in a city in time to guarantee his citizenship, but then events worsen. Highlights are the burning in the Saloon and the climatic clash at the end. Phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as an avenging angel and bitter gunslinger, he is the whole show. Live and animated soundtrack by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Lee Garmes. The film is surprisingly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in the Attic) who made good western episodes like -Convite for a gunslinger and -Zane Gray¨. Achievable results for this eccentric West.
