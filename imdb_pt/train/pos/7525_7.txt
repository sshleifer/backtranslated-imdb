Bettie Page was a repressed 1950s icon representing sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a great job portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a small-town girl with ambitions of acting and a great body. Her acting career did not work out, but her body took her to the pinnacle of fame in an admittedly peripheral camp. Photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes as she leaves the world of exploration in New York City, this made-for-TV (HBO) film has good production values ​​and a very credible supporting cast. The problem is that it is emotionally quite flat. It is difficult to form an attachment to the character, since Bettie is portrayed as someone rather shallow and naive, given the business in which it was. The self-service government investigations receive a lot of screen time, which slows down the film in the end. But it is definitely worth observing the history of the time and seeing the heavy government repression characteristic of the fifties. 7/10
