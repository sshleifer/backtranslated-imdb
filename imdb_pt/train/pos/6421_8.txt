"Men of Honor" - true story about a proud and persistent Black Sea diver (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that plays and entertains and forms part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Wonderful acting is the main reason for making this movie something truly special and quite enjoyable, splendid experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as Billy Sunday's brutal, ferocious and ruthless boss - the paper is practically written for him. This film alongside fantastic "15 Minutes" (2001) are two of the most recent evidence that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Men of Honor" includes a good performance by Cuba Gooding Jr., who has been one of the most promising young black actors since "Boyz n the hood." "Men of Honor" goes straight to the company of "Jerry Maguire," "As Good As It Is," and "Instinct." Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor and I am prepared to receive many wonderful films from him. "Men of Honor" also has a great story and probably the most exciting diving sequences in movie history. This is a great fascinating movie and I can only recommend it.
