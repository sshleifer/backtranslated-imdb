Classics of worship are almost impossible to predict. Who would have guessed that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: Space Oddysey, movies that have been criticized by both the critics and the public after the release, would become hugely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike most of those who hated envy (evidenced by a sad rating of 4.4), I find envy one of the funniest movies of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is ridiculous. The dialogue is not intelligent, the scenes have little continuity and the script seems to have been written by a fourth grader. But that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. You see, in order to enjoy the accidental genius of envy, you have to enjoy the film from an ironically impartial point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love envy? Because the movie is bad enough to be good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy definitely fits the bill.
