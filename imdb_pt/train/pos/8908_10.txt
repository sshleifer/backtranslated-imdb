Firstly, I had not seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 years old and seeing him as an adult was an amazing experience. Pages could be written about his influence on horror movies to this day. And even more could be written in his social subtext with the 50's "teenage fear". But this little tale of interplanetary horror is still a great horror movie if you let it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems tacky as everyone goes out in our modern world. But "The Blob" fits into some genuinely scary moments as a bunch of kids track down the unstoppable creature when adults do not believe them. In fact, there are even some gloomy moments in your candy-colored world. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story deserved in the role that we, the viewers, really get caught up in the moment and we believe in it. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, if you can take your filter out of postmodern irony, there is much more to love here than eyes.
