This is a very fun movie considering the budget and its length. The plot is hardly touched in the world of cinema so it also brought a sense of novelty. The acting was great (P'z to Dom) and the cinematography was also very well done. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is into thrillers, it will not disappoint you!
