This movie has great fighting scenes. Now it's true that acting is a bit difficult. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would watch a Cheesy Like American Beauty movie. But if you want to see a movie with true martial arts and amazing acrobatics without the use of wires and flying played the air like so many movies around now that are killing the matrix. So watch this. It is now true that the two main stars of the show where in the boy show the power rangers and another member of the cast of the show has a small part in this film. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p ** s his pants. And the acrobatics are valuable enough for Jackie Chan to sit and admire.
