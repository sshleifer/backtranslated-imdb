Another small piece of the vast Holocaust puzzle is turned upside down in this documentary about the Berlin Protest Rosenstrasse, an event I did not know, which began in late February 1943. The details are given in an addendum below This review . <br /> <br /> The film's narrative defines the history of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in New York City at present. Here a successful, non-observant Jewess whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox ritual of mourning. She goes even further, demanding that her daughter's non-Jewish fiance leave the house. <br /> <br /> The afflicted daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader), learns for the first time from an older cousin who during World War II in Berlin. , her 8-year-old mother was taken away and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin and meets this woman, Lena Fischer, now in her 90s. Hannah easily convinces the woman to tell her story. Everything seems a little too much. <br /> <br /> The film after that improves, focusing on long flashbacks especially in the 1943 events surrounding the protest, in which the fictional central character is the same Mrs. Fischer at age 33. performed magnificently by Katja Riemann), a talented baroness and pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> The narrative briefly recounts the present from time to time and also ends in New York once again. While the scenes in the present are saturated with color, the 1943 scenes are washed out, strong in blue-gray tones. <br /> <br /> The acting quality is generally very good, which we could expect given the deep reservoir of talent. in Germany and in the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent female filmmaker of German Cinema, herself an ex-actress. <br /> <br /> The history of protest is simply told. There is only one feature that would have helped: text notes still at the end, indicating the final result for those people trapped in Rosenstrasse, a result that, as the addendum below makes clear, is unbelievably positive. <br /> <br /> "Rosenstrasse" did not do well in the opinions of most movie critics. Extremely long, unnecessarily layered, provider of gender stereotypes, manipulating music: follow the usual beatings. Is very far. But I found in this film an austere, powerful, spontaneous, and totally convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil off-site at Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I did not find anything flashy, contemporary or manipulative in this representation. The very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or physically brutalized) intensified my tension, which increased progressively as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some vicious attack to start any minute. The sadness of the movie stayed with me later. I woke up many times later the night I saw the movie, my mind full of dark, melancholy and chaotic images and feelings conjured up by the film. For me, this happens rarely. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Seen on 05/31/05).

But before the deportation of prisoners could occur in this case, wives and other relatives learned of what was happening and appeared at the address of Rosenstrasse, first in one and two, and then in increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Maybe up to six thousand participated in the protest, although not all at the same time. Women demanded back husbands, day after day, for a week. Disarmed, disorganized, and without leadership, they faced the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels, Berlin's Gauleiter (governor or district leader), eager to have this racially-purified city, was also in charge of the country's public morals. In both cases, he was concerned about the possible repercussions of women's actions. Instead of calling for more open dissent by throwing women on the streets and fearing to compromise the "Final Solution," Goebbels, with the agreement of Hitler, freed the prisoners from Rosenstrasse and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them. sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all the freed from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won a surprising victory over the forces of destruction.
