As a bad movie lover, I definitely hit this one. The plot is not that bad, but there are some cases where you really have to ask yourself "what the heck is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore got so fat and slow when the film was filmed, that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double the time. There are also scenes in which there is an instant replay in slow motion, jumping on a ten-foot high wall (playing falling from her back), naked men sticking out of huge letters and sex that literally knocks over the ceiling (with of course no movie of Rudy Ray Moore would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy scene where Rudy makes fun of all the clients, brought with people doing a strange dance.There are so many bad things about this movie, but they are bad in a fun way, and if you take your eyes off of the movie, you might lose another error. Rating: 1/10 for real value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for picking and bumbling, average for 7/10.
