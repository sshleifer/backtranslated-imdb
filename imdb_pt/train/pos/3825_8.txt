A young woman arrives at her husband's hometown after he died in an accident. She barely settles in this small town, but soon after, loses her son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This could lead to all types following plans in a normal movie: find a new partner and be happy finally; or depressed enough to fight and finally kill herself ... She tries to kill herself, but not after a series of severe fights with God. She trusts God, only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should be careful here about God, the movie does not mean a thing against God. The way the film deals with the question is quite interesting: not from the woman's point of view or from God's perspective (that way, there would be a lot of grass growing, clouds flying, I suppose). On the contrary, it is from the point of view of a third party, the film lets us perceive and does not explain a thing. <br /> <br /> The movie would not be so interesting if there was only the woman. There is this man who is everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her, but in her own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown I should say, who shamelessly hangs around our heroine. The combination of these two, the woman full of tension, crying and vomiting always, and the man, smiling and talking stupidly, ends up in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or very tedious. <br /> <br /> Highly recommendable.
