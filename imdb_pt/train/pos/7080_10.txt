Terry Gilliam gives an awesome movie, which I really enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small appearance of Christover Plummer make the film absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think this is one of Bruce Willis' top four films; and the best of Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt delivers perfect performance. Possibly one of the ten best performances the actor has ever seen. He played his part (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted remarkably well. With the brilliant story to support the great performances; and to support this, the superb guidance of Terry Gilliam.
