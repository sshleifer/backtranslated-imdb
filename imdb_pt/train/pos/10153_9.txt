I got this movie in a test show. I was very surprised to find a very sweet and fun story. Well acted. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male lead was fantastic. Very funny movie. It takes place in the best locations in New York. Made me want to go there. I just saw "You received an email" I thought "It had to be you" was a much better story. Cooler. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. Audience I saw with beloved, a definitive recommendation!
