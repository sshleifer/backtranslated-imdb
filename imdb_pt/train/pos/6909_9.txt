... and if you are very, very good, it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a rather silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and the cast and acting were spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine the actors have. You have a glimpse of what the actors are behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just as his character has his best role playing the dead dictator! And the farewell scene: as something out of Casablanca, indeed! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was superb as the chief parador of the secret police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are homage to other films, such as "Gather the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as the girlfriend - besides being a really hot number: "You must win an Oscar for tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget Johnny Winters as a CIA agent and the various guest actors: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas and Dick Cavett - all perfectly done. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable prank under the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
