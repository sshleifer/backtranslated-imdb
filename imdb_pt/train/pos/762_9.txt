I like to see people doing breakdance, especially if they do, as well as the best scenes in this movie that takes you to a disco called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a "MC Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> Even if this is an old movie, and even though I videotaped it on TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed it in the summer of 2004 on its own big screen, I went there to take a look. It is much nicer on the big screen than on the TV. <br /> <br /> Even if many people think that watching it on the big screen is a waste of money for the cost of the ticket, I do not agree with it and I think that when I paid my ticket, I made the money seeing it, cinema, especially sitting in the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just in the video.
