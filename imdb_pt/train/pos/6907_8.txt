This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you're going to have fun with it. I think "Dave" became South American when Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor among the works, hand-picked by the head of the nation's secret Parador, to replace the junkie of a dictator, Alfonse Simms, after he had a heart attack and died. Noah goes on, aided in his role by the ex-dictator's mistress, while they try to thwart Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also makes an appearance as a warm American immigrant who turns out to be CIA. Also starring Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. Some absurd moments, like the old dictator's body, remain frozen for a year, and the final scene where Sonia Braga, who bee, cradles the bloody body of Dreyfus. is seen moments later, all immaculate white, with only a stain on it. But after all, it's a great joke.
