Of course, this movie is satiated, sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's fun, and that's why I watch movies. To have fun. Natasha Henstridge is awesome, even with short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. They both seemed to really like others in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were amused to watch, even though d'Abo's British accent had infiltrated his supposed speech in the Bronx. To tell you the truth, I had not really realized until I read those reviews, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but she was ideal for her role with that one exception. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two cool people who are marrying other important people, but who find their soulmates in each other. It may be an unlikely story, but who says the movies are supposed to play documentaries? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are displayed every hour on the tube. That's why we watch them, to escape the monotony of daily life for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who rips easily. But do not get me wrong, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had many of those. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 just because I'm saving my 10/10 for this yet super unseen magnificent movie that I know will come someday. If you're advertised as appearing on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or something, write it down to watch it. I think you will like it.
