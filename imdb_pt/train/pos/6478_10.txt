Despite being told from a British perspective, this is the best World War II documentary ever produced. Presented in digestible episodes (as digestible as war can be) while the grave voice of Laurence Olivier connects the multitudes of eyewitnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time. Anxiously awaiting his appearance on DVD in the USA. The Europeans had the opportunity with a DVD release earlier this year.
