Oh my God ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you on an incredible ride and will not let you go until the last blow on your face ends. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and such. Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I did not like a few things, they used many stand ins. I wanted to see the real person fight, but, well ... some minor disappointments, and I really did not like it very much until I watched it again, when you understand more, that ends with the **! I encourage anyone who wants to see a real Asian movie to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. Go and see when to leave in America !!!
