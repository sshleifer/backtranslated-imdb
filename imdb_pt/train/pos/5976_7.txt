Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This movie prank revolves around the '80s culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies - two things I love so much. So, as you can imagine, this movie attracted me very easily. In addition, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all losers, has become drenched in a world of "evil" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected - playing his latest unpublished album backwards. This allows the singer to resolve to kill people with demons and help. <br /> <br /> Ok, it's really tacky sometimes, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), very good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what's really bad is the music. Ironic, right? Well, this uber-evil metal guy is one of the most detestable, strident and whining Motley Crue rejects on the planet - and "Metal" is little more than the putrid Pop / Hair Metal of the 80s. the clich√©s here, of prancing like a gay fairy, to look mean, to shout "Rock and Roll !!!" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond vomit. Apart from this atrocious musical performance, it's actually quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
