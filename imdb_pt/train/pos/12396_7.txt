This is the second part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of short animated films that tell us a bit more about the world of 'The Matrix'. <br /> <br /> In this, we learn how men and machines could not work and live together. It's a little history lesson in the world of 'The Matrix'. Not as good as the first part ("The Final Flight of the Osiris"), but still a lot of fun.
