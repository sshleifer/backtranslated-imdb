To this day I had never seen this movie. It was filmed on the sets of Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the villagers' blood. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it's a very good movie that has plenty of atmosphere and a cast that will not give up, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder who is of interest to me , since it was my grandmother's maiden name. a carefully modulated film that has suspense and spirited liners that slowly build themselves up for their brief run time, only getting lost when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to shut it down. From that point to the end it is a straight run to the end with very little of the fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and the IMDb list a 71-minute run time and warn of shorter impressions. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case I think they are a source I trust more says total time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). which are available tend to run around for 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably less if its 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not matter much since its five minutes and I highly doubt that it will make or break the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever the running time, if you like old movies, do, by all means, watch this movie, it's a great dark and stormy night movie.
