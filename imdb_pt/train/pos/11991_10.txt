Ah, Talespin! What can I say that has not yet been said about this great show? Anything! This is undoubtedly one of the best written programs I've ever encountered, live-action or animation. The latest things are very stupid to my liking, and some of the "mature" things I have to kick the kids out of the room. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are engaging and very plausible. Some of them can be extended up to an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic and yet enjoyable for children and adults alike. Then there are the episodes of pure comedy, like Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh at the tears in some chosen ones. <br /> <br /> The drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays (at least, those that are not specifically aimed at it), especially in cartoons. In episode Stormy Weather, for example, Kit Cloudkicker decides he will join an air circus, but Baloo believes it would be very dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, to which Kit yells "NO! You can not tell me what to do!" * * * MY * * DAD *! and buries his face in the pillow. The next day, he leaves for the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be very welcome in those servants nowadays. <br /> <br /> The characters have too much depth for them. Baloo is pretty much the way he is in The Jungle Book, more or less a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a crafty business woman, whose ideas of making money, while good in theory, are seldom good in practice. Molly is a cute little girl, but you can not let that fool you. She can be a real hell sometimes. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He does not trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break relationships. Notice his expression in Plunder and Lightning as he grabs the hook: it looks like he's ready to hit a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the drama combined with the actual chemistry among the characters who make this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is well demonstrated in All Whale Whale That Ends Whale, when Baloo adopts Kit's word that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium, instead of siding with other adults. Baloo's and Becky's relationship is also realistic because Baloo's motivation for work comes from wanting to buy back the old Sea Duck, not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he got the Duck back he would still do work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> Sea Duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is very realistically designed. Airplane functions do not change once throughout the series (continuity is also hard to find), and unlike most other "super-planes" of other cartoons, it does not have a single weapon on board (unless you count sleeves!), and relies, instead, on the cunning pilot's great ability to get out of trouble. It's hard to think of a hero vehicle that does not have some kind of revolver, laser cannon or even a gun somewhere on board. And the fact that they use their heads to get rid of problems is so hard to find in a cartoon these days. Plus, it's just such cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
