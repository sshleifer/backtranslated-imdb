A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs that contained two movies each. One of them had three Broadway girls (an alternate title for the Greeks had a word for them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a behind-the-scenes musical comedy that happens in Scotland and concerns a mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a limo to a millionaire. Vera-Ellen is that e-wow dancer, that legs! Ceasar Romero is the producer of her who ventures after the original protagonist leaves because he thinks she is dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is that rich guy who, looking for Vera-Ellen, is mistaken for a reporter who should interview her, but is blocked by Romero. What I just mentioned may be confusing, but (most of the time) it makes sense if you are willing to check your brain while watching the lovely comedy with wonderful musical numbers performed by the exquisite Mrs. Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a bit frantic here, but Niven becomes fun all over. The impression I saw was actually very good, considering its age and the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen does very well with her lines, since she's not really an actress. So on that note, I recommend Happy Go Lovely to movie fans who love outdated musical comedies.
