Since it's been a few years since I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back and review it more in the department, but first some internal notes from a movie critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up with it, made my childhood joyful, became incredible, I miss some of these things today that clearly do not see as much as we did in days, well for the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte who is called in Denmark is a large animated series, is very similar to chip and dale, ducktales and many of those old, then have that strange feeling around I can not remember this series as much as I'd like to remember. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, it was very good, it came with some kind of message, not that wild message, but it's one of the old ones so they can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to look old or anything, but I feel like time slipped out of my hands with these drawings, today we see something like Ed And dd and Eddy or something strange like that, we have all these new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana or something, but I feel like we do not have the same spirit in real cartoons or concerts as we did in The Early Days. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that time has changed a lot, to conclude, I would be happy to see these series as the Talespin being released back to the TV screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood drawings, give them to the children I have someday, give them back ...
