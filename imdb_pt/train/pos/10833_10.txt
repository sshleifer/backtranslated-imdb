This movie made me cry in the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen a lot of great movies, even worse. But when the scene ends - catharic at its core - came I cried! And if you did not - you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it's real - because that sort of thing really happened and people actually exist. Glam is not my kind of song, but I really admire everything they went through in the early 70's ... At some point this directed me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never work very well. But this movie really made me believe in everything ... Because they do not try to do that as a path full of glorious shows, musicians present who are superheroes, groupie girls who are stupid and emotionally insensitive, they do not glorify drugs and alcohol , they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes up to 20 years behind ... Again, a great movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I've never been so moved by a movie.
