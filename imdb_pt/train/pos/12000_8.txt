I think the film is educational. However, it can not address the issue that has provoked so much controversy: plural marriage. In addition, the film does not reveal what the LDS church stands for. Great opportunity was lost to tell the world what they really believe. I could not get a clear idea of ​​what the LDS visions are about the central themes of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are nice people. It would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they see the most controversial statements of their prophet. Maybe these statements are too controversial to be treated in film format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's really interesting life. After all, it gives an insight into American thought about religion in the eighteenth century. I hope they make some documentaries on this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We can have a Mormon president someday. After all, Smith ran for president.
