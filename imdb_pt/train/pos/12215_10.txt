I loved this movie from the opening sequence to the end. I found the style of director / actor to direct me directly to the very engaging audience. <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing about this film was to ignore - and therefore challenge - gender and class stereotypes. . The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment - and the acceptance of the characters of themselves and each other - allowed me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this film has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept themselves as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
