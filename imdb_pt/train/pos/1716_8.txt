Abhay Deol meets the cute Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister" !!! This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl ran away from her home in Nainital and came to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not appear leaving Soha with a broken heart and alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the low-class neighbor protects herself against vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job and shelter in a nursing home. Slowly romance blossoms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A film made with sensitivity, with a very unusual story, lovingly filmed in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. Does this well-crafted movie have moments that will remain eternally engraved in someone's memory? the first awkward kiss and Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "class wali ladki" and adds hastily "that he does not love her"; her gift a churidar to Soha and invite her to a date. <br /> <br /> The music is good and the background music is great. In a scene where Soha runs and hugs Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. Stillness conveys both the embarrassment and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The pungent ending makes a bitter and sweet movie, whose memories will last for a long time. A must see I'll rate it 8,5 / 10
