Usually, "children" movies have an annoying quality, which makes it very boring and unbearable for someone over the age of 13. But again, it's before Holes came on the scene. Of course, it has the same moments that often give a children's film its aforementioned quality, but this movie does a good job at staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and Stanley's uncomfortable dynamic with some of the other campers was more realistic than most of the films sought to portray. What I particularly liked about this movie was the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a bit more natural than most would imagine, like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also have a similar redeeming end). The only downside? The Ugly Lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.
