"The Straight Story" is a truly beautiful film about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawn mower across the country to visit his dying and distant brother. But this is just the basic synapse ... this movie is much more than that. This was the last role of Richard Farnworth before he died, and it is definitely one that he will be remembered for. He's a stubborn man, not unlike the old men you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It will go down and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.
