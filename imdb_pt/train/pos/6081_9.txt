You do not get darker or tragic than "Othello" and this film captures the play very well, with excellent performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne expresses to the viewer the torment of Othello when he is a victim of Iago's lies convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear that since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also enter and leave the scene, although, like Iago, they seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the game to see how many lines have been cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism of the film would be that the story unfolds very quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not defined anymore. The director had a great cast, and no one offered poor performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and between Em√≠lia and Desdemona needs to be further developed at the beginning of the film. I have the feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you have a sense of it too late in the movie. Besides, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it look like they've just met. On the other hand, perhaps those who have just met - like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short: good performances, very short. <br /> <br />
