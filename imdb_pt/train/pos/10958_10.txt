This show is so incredibly hilarious that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central today (despite the fact that I've seen all the episodes previously). I've always considered Silverman as a huge talent and this is ultimately a vehicle for talent to be enjoyed by a broad audience. I watch this show and river a very large percentage of the time ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) funny! This is a show that I will never miss and it's one I'm going to buy on DVD as soon as I leave. You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I foresee a long term for this series ... And just to be clear, people who are offended by this program simply do not understand ... maybe they have no intelligence to understand this ... they should stop making fools by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "intolerant" in reference to Silverman, or who claims that she only intends to "shock" ... is far from the truth ... She is the exact opposite; only her Google and you will quickly see that she is a great advocate of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that she is ironically embracing all these outrageous views, you do not understand. And if you can not, do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
