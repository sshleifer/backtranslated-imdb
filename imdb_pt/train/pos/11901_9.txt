As far as I remember, Balanchine's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: 1) The final section of the Grossvatertanz (a traditional song played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give < <br /> 2) A violin solo, written for but eliminated from Tchaikovsky's soundtrack for Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the scene. the scene of transformation. Balanchine chose this song because of its melodic relationship with music to the growing Christmas tree that occurs soon after. <br /> <br /> 3) The ground for the knight of Sugar Plum's Harvest is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine somehow desecrated the great score of Tchaikovsky is wrong.
