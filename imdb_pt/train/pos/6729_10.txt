If you've ever seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the true, non-caricature, "American's" American side, then the Riding Giants will go deeper than anything you've ever seen before. This film is "unreal", an easy term, if there is any, but extremely appropriate if you can extract any form of literal meaning - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera, and the apparent sense of love, expert and knowledge instilled by the direction and narration of Stacy Peralta, this film cleverly takes you from swell to big wave, keeping you completely fascinated in all that you have the privilege of seeing . <br /> This film is a symphony, worked well as Beethovens 9, beginning beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii, deeply pulling human emotion in Santa Cruz and ending with uproar, triumph and booming in Laird Hamiltons talents, again in Hawaii. such as classical music; like Beethoven's ninth, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
