For as insane and off the wall as things stand, Leon, 30 years old. former paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together. He is like a child always trying to catch the balloon that is floating so that everything works out so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film could have gone far. on top, but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the group here with a performance that shines through their absurd sick tics. Just like the characters in the movie, we ignore their sudden bursts to see the real person underneath. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. He takes the most extreme plot twists and keeps them real. It's your screenplay and your cast that help keep the whole thing afloat. It is a true testament to Majkowski's skill and everyone involved that this film, with its plot and grudging characters, never worked on our nerves.
