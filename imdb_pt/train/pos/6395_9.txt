For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Seeing racism, fighting for life and proving himself, he is not just an ordinary "cookie," Carl Brashear is an incredible character to play, who puts Cuba at his best. , best performance in his life.De Niro, who is a living legend gives this to the film.Hateu his character in the film, but he gives very good performance for this film, great performance.And the appearance of the beautiful Charlize was and as always is a great advantage for all movies. So, if you have not yet seen this movie, it is highly recommended for those who love bravery, greatness that seeks inspiration. You should look for this great drama. My vote 9/10.
