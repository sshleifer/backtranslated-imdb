When I sat down to watch "Largo Winch," I expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw them; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was not finally the antagonist of a movie to begin with. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role well, but the two real stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both acting superbly. In Radivoje Bukvic he portrayed Goran well. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics brought a beautiful color to the film, but I understand why people would tire of it. The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the stunning Croatian coastline surprised me, and I almost did not want to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limo type cars; this is their movie. It's also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extreme beauty and, above all, a well-written action movie with dazzling combat and a completely interwoven internal drama. <br /> <br /> My vote, as clarified a somber day is: 10/10
