I caught the end of this movie channel surfing through the cable channels, and I was so intrigued that I looked for the next show. <br /> <br /> I did not really know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed. He also gave me as an adult who attended high school in the 80's, a little better view on what our kids have to deal with these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the shooting only contributes to the coldness of the plot. Watching children and adults strive to understand and come to terms with the senseless shots was sometimes overwhelming. And I'll admit I shed a few tears all the time. Overall, not a movie I would seek, but I'm happy to see it.
