I'll be honest with you, I was a high school student, when this sitcom first aired on ABC, I do not think I would like it at all. But with John Ritter, I felt it had a small potential, moreover, it was something else I liked. The acting was great, not a lot of second-rate comedy lines, John Ritter always brings his game A when it comes to comedy. This was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was such a great show. My dad who never watches sitcoms, he just watches movies, sports and law and order, he actually sat with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother and I, and watched the show because I think John Ritter was in it. I honestly think this show would still be happening if John Ritter, God, rested his soul, I wish he had not passed away.
