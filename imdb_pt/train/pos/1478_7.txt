I liked this movie, although in the middle, I was able to tell who was the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I'm also wondering if it was based on a true story since he spoke about "real" people. At the end of the movie. I think I'll have to research it and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember where that happened? I believe they moved to North Carolina, if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, states could have been changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You would think this man could have discovered this as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
