This one is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but had a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novelty in it. In other words, too much ground to cover. Sometimes she was a soap opera operative, but she also had some visually dramatic moments with a locust attack at the end of the movie. That was amazing to see. Considering that this film is about 70 years old, the special effects team of this movie did a spectacular job. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their time and did not disappoint here. , both giving powerful performances. The only problem is credibility, since all Asians are interpreted by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, simply do not seem real. I'd like to see a remake of this movie with Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but simply make the story look and sound more reliable.
