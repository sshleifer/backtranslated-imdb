This film brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the hearts of the viewers by directing this wonderful picture where life is seen through Paulie's mind and heart. From time to time we have discovered, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just could not stop my tears, even if the movie had a happy ending. That's great, after thousands of movies I've seen through my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. That is, after the "Ugly Duckling", the second photo that really turned me upside down.
