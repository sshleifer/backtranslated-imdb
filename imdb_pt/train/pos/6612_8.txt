Just as Final Fantasy brought the CG to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion capture. Neither film nor cartoon, this movie looks like a tribute to the film Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris the way it almost could be, the characters look as real as you and me. They blink, stumble, tremble like real actors in a way never achieved before. <br /> <br /> Do not go watch. Hoping to find a twister mind. You'll probably find out before you get to the middle of the movie. The scenery is certainly very simplistic compared to famous thrillers, but this is definitely bliss for the eyes.
