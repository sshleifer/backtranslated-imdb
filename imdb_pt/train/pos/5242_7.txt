I really liked this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives a view of the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is very rarely dealt with in films, most of which tell us about the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they gave very honest and convincing portraits of a very decadent underworld that many people do not hear speak out of my homeland. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun ganster movie with stellar performances from a who's who in the cast of Northern Irish actors. It will not move the earth, though it may slightly open the eyes of some people to the obscure world of legalistic paramilitaries.
