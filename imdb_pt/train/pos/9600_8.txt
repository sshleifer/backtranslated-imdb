This film is a touching story about an adventure taken by Darius Weems, 15. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a still untreatable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the United States. He and a few close friends travel through the country to Los Angeles with the goal of leaving their customized wheelchair on MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of their favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang goes west for a trip that all its participants will never forget. Darius manages to ride the boat for the first time, ride in a hot air balloon, swim in the ocean and visit sights he always wanted to see like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material. They do not make money from sales of the $ 20 dvds. $ 17 goes to research the disease and $ 3 goes to make more copies. The film has won more than 25 awards at festivals and I agree with Variety's quote, "Certain to stir hearts."
