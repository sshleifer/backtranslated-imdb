That's at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes. It shows Izzard as the brilliantly talented comedian he is. What I particularly like is that he seems never to be "dumbing down" the material to his audience. His timing is flawless and the routine is tied up as a performance piece, rather than just a series of jokes. Thumbs up.
