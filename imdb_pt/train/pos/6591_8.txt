The invisible man is a show that everyone has to love! This reminds me of the 80's old school series (a team, airwolf, knightrider) Special effects are small, but very effective! but the most important thing is the fun they had in filming this series. This really shows! the whole cast fit neatly into roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! for me it's unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his style of acting Do not stand a chance in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino this was the show you should have directed instead of that great annoying serious danger (csi)) show yourself you can. Worth it !!!
