I did not have high expectations for the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is notable in a very different role. He turned out the slippery armani suits for a ridiculous look and made up for showing that he is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play against each other and make one of the best pairs of friends in a long time. The humor is bleak, the presentations of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are great, mix it up with a story about friendship, and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the best comedies of friends in a long time. This is a movie that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
