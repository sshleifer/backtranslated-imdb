Although I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give up baby Jesse, and it's something I would never do, they were trying to do what was best for the baby. The way this movie is written, you get caught up in the story and wondering what you really believe, in all aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unheard of, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie, she really convinces you that she's psychotic, or at least that there's something seriously wrong with her. His character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed." The movie seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unsolved. But in addition, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to relax and watch something cute that will make you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspectives of others and find out something about yourself. Caution: you can even grow while watching this movie! And it's all worth it in the end.
