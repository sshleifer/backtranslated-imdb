I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not even sure what it is particularly, but I think it was wonderful and should be available for the DVD. The women were strange and still gotten well enough to spend their time in Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so different and yet a clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama, and relationship problems in good time. This requires 10 lines, but I just can not think of anything else to say, so I'll continue until I get to 10 lines. Sorry about that. What else can I say that it's been a long time since I last saw her. I look forward to seeing you again, but it is not available.
