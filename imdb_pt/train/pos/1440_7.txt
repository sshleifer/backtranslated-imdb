I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The moody mood of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old idealist pol and youth were affecting. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; she was a serious and attractive character. The movie went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor began snooping on the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly did not want him to intrude on. No one in their right mind would find a mafioso on an abandoned quay in a junkyard. Here the story has become implausible. Something I do not understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a gunfight if the latter was handing out information that could topple the corrupt judge?
