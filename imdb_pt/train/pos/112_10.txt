EUROPE (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have been with the birth of the narrative film, almost a century ago. This film is truly unique and a work of genius. The camera work and editing are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film, create a strange and unforgettable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two guilty Pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow provides his great voice as the narrator. <br /> <br /> A unique movie! Four stars (highest rating).
