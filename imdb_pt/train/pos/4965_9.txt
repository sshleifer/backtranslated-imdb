Of all the football movies I've seen, this is one of the two best. The other being feverish. But Hero is about the greatest world cup of all time and, consequently, is also the greatest player of all time in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him mainly, but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the moment. <br /> <br /> The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. Michael Caine's narration is adequately impartial and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual world cup games; instead it is more about the emotions of the players and about the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like France v Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) were approached along the same lines. The final Argentine v W Germany was also on the same line. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be seen repeatedly, especially if you are a fan of Maradona.
