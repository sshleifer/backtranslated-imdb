In this movie we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba in the movie when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film still dates back to before Simba and (presumably) soon after the birth of Kiara. Very faithful to the first film, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)" is a fun, entertaining, surprising and surprising film (or sequel, if that's what you want call him). A bundle of surprises and hilarity await you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumba are watching a movie in the movies (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaha have a discussion about which point of "The Lion King." "they're going to start watching because Timon wants to go to the role when he and Pumbah go in and Pumbah wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair commitment to watch the movie of their own story, which is what they expect ... with Timon's first house ... <br /> <br /> For anyone with a good sense of humor who likes the first movies of almost any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
