Having been a fan of 'Columbo', I was very disappointed with 'Corky Romano'. Although certainly a funny movie, the chief character of Falk's mafia was a far cry from the kind lieutenant that he played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After 'Corky Roman', I was sincerely surprised and soured with Mr Peter Falk. However, having just seen 'Finding John Christmas' and its predecessor, 'A Town Without Christmas', for the first time within a week of each other, I have to say that 'Max', Peter Falk's delightful character in both the movies, is certainly as memorable and amiable as "Columbus." While parts of the film are fairly predictable, such scenes do not take the pleasure of seeing the story being presented. I'd also like to have recorded these two exciting Christmas movies, and I'd recommend them if you're a fan of Falk, a Christmas nut, or just someone who likes the occasional feel-good movie of the week. This movie may end up lost among the throngs of holiday movies made for TV, so be sure to find 'Finding John Christmas' before it's too late.
