What a relief to discover that I am not imagining this program! the summary of the tax collector is great. I also remember finding it scary and not particularly familiar, I must have been 10/11 at the time I watched. I think for a girl who ages part of the attraction was the very blonde hair of lead and its permanently sad state. The theme was played on a flute I remember - although I can not remember how it went. I think the introduction showed him playing - or maybe he played a flute in the show and especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm destined to never know how it ended or see the clip or hear the melody, but at least now I know it's not just me.
