John Waters gave us a genuinely entertaining film. This certainly is not without its shocking moments of Waters, but it is meeker than its older things, like "Pink Flamingos". "Pecker" goes back to John's early stage in which it reminds the spectator of the same kind of humor that was evident in "Polyester." Overall a very entertaining comedy with some great moments!
