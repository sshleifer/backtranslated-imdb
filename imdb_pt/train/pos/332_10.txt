Although I have not seen this miniseries in over twenty years, I still remember how the balance between character, plot and story of wonderful adventures was successful. The use of special effects was contained, becoming a poetic rather than literal account. The two versions I saw were dubbed (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their own language not just Italian, so there is a sync problem. Do not spoil the story. Among the cast Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable to the Americans. Recommended to all followers of Ulysses who return.
