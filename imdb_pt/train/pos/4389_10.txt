From the outstanding performance of an extremely impressive cast, to the cleverly written (and very quoteable) script from the luxurious cinematography to the beautiful soundtrack to Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity in film experiences: one that is almost impossible to find fault in any area . <br /> <br /> There have been several comparisons made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With all due credit to Mel Gibson, Braveheart struck me as a self-conscious and prejudiced epic to rival Rob Roy as the kind of movie I'd like to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy just grabs you and engages you in his well-edited narrative. Not a single scene is wasted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. The characters are very affectionate, transmitting perfectly vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic scene of the time. <br /> <br /> In addition, they are not caricatures of good and evil, as we all often observe even in modern movies. For example, while we wait for the heroic Rob Roy to prevail, we realize that his difficulties are the product of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most odious bandits in movie history, but there are times when we can understand how the events of his life shaped him to become what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes his story even more believable and exciting. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest choreographed swordfights ever and a climactic end worthy of all history. tense anticipation.
