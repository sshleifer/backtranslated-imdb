"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A tragicomedy with profound implications for the fate of mankind, shown by the eyes of seemingly very simple and ordinary people from a Serbian province forgotten by God shortly before the outbreak of World War II. I saw him in a small movie theater in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution, and I have not had a chance to find it since. It's a pity that this great movie is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of her many times, and unfortunately - I could not find any. I would be grateful to the other fans of this little gem of making movies for a suggestion of ways to buy a copy.
