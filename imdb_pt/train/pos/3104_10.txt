This movie was excellent. I did not expect him to fulfill all the enthusiasm, but that's what happened. Like all Bourne movies, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy, you'll love this too. The plot of the film is straightforward and there are no twists that are very unrealistic. Okay, the character of Julia Stiles appearing in the Italian hideout was a little unlikely, especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she is the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows, who does not want him dead and he could trust and the only person to lead you in the right direction. The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. The thing I've always loved about Bourne's films is that Bourne can kick his ass, but when combined with people as good as he is, fights are fights and he suffers a lot of damage on them. They never treat the public like idiots. <br /> <br /> All actors were solid in their performances. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from Joan Allen reprizing his role in Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. I miss Franka Potente though.
