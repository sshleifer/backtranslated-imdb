a movie about the cruelty of this world. I find it liberating, as only truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Some of the performances are extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter, for example. The director tried to describe life in the most realistic way possible, achieving success. Coherently, the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understood a phrase, I found the vision of the film in the original language with much more gratifying subtitles, because with dubbing half the actors' great work gets lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to duplicate by a voice actor. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
