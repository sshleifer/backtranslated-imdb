A struggling actor thinks the best way to invade Hollywood is to start overthrowing the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sarcastic look on the existence of the actor (and not so much) of Los Angeles. It brings us into this world with effortless wit and wit. He also has a polished appearance and very competent steering under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that does not compromise its production values ​​at any level. Writing is tight, the first rate of dialogue. Cassini is an actor, and the role really shows off his talents. The climactic scene between him and René Garcia is an instant classic, and may fall as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it on an advanced display, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and got excited about it later.
