This is one of the best movies of Jackie that is him without opera friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao has one of the best openings in any action movie and continues like this with Jackie showing some high quality acrobatics, the only critisim is that in the middle stays a bit slow but he appears to a frenetic last 25 minutes in the movie and the final credits show what a crazy idiot jackie chan is just to keep us addicted to happy movies
