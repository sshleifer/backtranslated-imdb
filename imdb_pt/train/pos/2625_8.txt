Surprisingly it's not terrible and very lively for one of Disney's daughters filming sequences. As in the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I was glad that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors, which makes a big difference and they maintained a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders for a while, but we are distracted by an endless series of jokes ranging from hilarious to monotonous. To break the separate storyline and jokes, they gave us some silly musical sequences, which very much like jokes, ranging from entertainment to a quick trip to the refrigerator. For the most part, MST3K-like moments are smooth and full of untapped potential and, in fact, do not add much to the film, except to act as a vehicle for a one-hour flashback. The new characters are at least sympathetic, and the old characters are doing their thing so I can not blame them there. Overall, this movie is not bad and makes a good frivolous fill between the Lion King's most serious titles.
