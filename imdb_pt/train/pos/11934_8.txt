At first you think of another Disney movie, it might be nice, but it's a children's movie. But when you watch, you can not help but have fun. All ages will love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is great and could not play better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the role. Tony Danza is as believable as Mel Clark. You can not help but like this movie! I give it a 10/10!
