Having seen only two of his photos earlier, I came to an agreement with Altman. Before, though, I've always labeled his "boring" style of making movies. You just have to be in perfect judgment to enjoy your crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is quite underestimated, and very questionably out of print. Actually, I do not think it was even broadcast for VHS. Why is that? When all these bad movies get daily DVD releases, is it left behind for no good reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this movie. It was, for the most part, consistently fun and funny. Almost all the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances. There is a real skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's task at the bottom of the pool is kind of fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this little oblivion. egg yolk. It's not perfect, but it's way better than most of the slime out there getting DVD releases. Hell, I'd be happy to have a good VHS copy of that thing. <br /> <br /> However, it's always on Fox Movie Channel, so keep an eye on it.
