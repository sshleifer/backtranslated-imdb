I think this movie was probably much more powerful when it debuted in 1943, although it seems a little boring and static these days to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940 - shortly before the US entered the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and suffering wife who has been able to raise and raise children without him from time to time. As the movie begins, they are crossing the Mexican border into the US and for the first time in years they will relax and stop running. The problem for me was that the family was very perfect and very decent - making them seem like an obvious positive advertisement rather than a real family suffering from real problems. While that had a very noble purpose at the time, it seems false today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children simply does not sound true. It sounded more like antifascist speeches than the voices of real children. They were therefore extremely irritating - especially the smallest who sometimes appeared as a child. The only ones who looked real were Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as the moody Romanian who lived with them (though he had no discernible accent). <br /> <br /> It is really hard to believe that the ultra- <br /> The famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue because it simply does not ring true to life. The story was based on the part of his lover, Lillian Hellman. And the basic story and plot are good, but the dialogue is bad at times. Overall, an interesting curiosity and a movie with some great moments, ... but that's really about everyone.
