Midnight Cowboy made a big noise when it was released in 1969, taking an X rating. By today's standards, it would be difficult to derive a R. rating. Jon Voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, a hick city ​​wanting to make success with the girls of the city of New York. He meets a street drug dealer named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to make friends with Buck for his own purposes. The two end up forging a connection that is both touching and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more so than in this picture. He is so in character that everything around him palms in comparison. Losing the Oscar for John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a skilled hand with his production, but this film has a dirty underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. Worth seeing for Hoffman's performance alone.
