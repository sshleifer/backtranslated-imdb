I recently got a chance to see "The Waterdance", and I really enjoyed it. I really do not understand why this is called since there is no dancing going on there except maybe for the dance at the strip club near the end. We are introduced to the main characters of the film, invalid in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically bored guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not watch movies like that today. I'm not "stuck in a while," I'm not saying that everything during the 80's and early 90's was better than today, but I really think the film industry is deteriorating and there's a lot we can learn from old movies for old movies I mean anything from 1920-1998.
