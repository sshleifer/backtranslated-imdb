I just watched this movie in my GCSE history class. It was exciting and it was a brilliant vision of what really happened to Steve Biko during the time of the Apartheid law. As anyone can say that this movie was the most annoying or dull 2 ​​1/2 hours of their lives I do not know why I had addicted from start to finish. It was great how Denzel Washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the Apartheid law and getting equal rights for blacks. In one part, Steve Biko tells a police officer that we are as weak and human as you, that is to show them that he and all the other blacks in South Africa were no different from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he was strong in what he believed and did not fully believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that rocked South Africa and started to wake up the world. I really enjoyed this movie and I strongly recommend this to people. this helped me to see that racism is not right and that all are equal, their fate should not be determined by someone's skin color. n
