A very average but bold film by Ms Hawn to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer and as a starred vehicle. Although she ends up vindicated, she is willing to portray herself as the dumb asshole. How many other listed actresses have suffered injuries since this movie? Not many. Does that mean that the female ass can not be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses, since she maintains a persona on the screen and ventures into projects that others do not. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, for example Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman would never catch the fall. A wonderful artist. Great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYoung remarkably.
