The beginning of this movie is a little awkward and confusing, but feel firm because you are in the way of your life. The concept is attractive, with interesting devices used to tell the general story. There are good performances around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best of the cast - no surprise at all. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. Mr. Lumet's direction is excellent. The film has a feeling of the seventies in the sense that the risks are taken in the narration of this story, but unlike most banal movies that populate the landscape today, this is a suspense based sincerely on relationships and not on special effects or plugs of products. . You will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
