Usually I really like movies like "Chances Are," but I was not very pleased with this for a few reasons. The first half was well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and reincarnating in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and his friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown. The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he was once are well made, and there is a good deal of excitement and happiness, since Shepherd finally believes that she is actually her reincarnated husband, but from then on the movie plummets. There are several sex-related scenes that completely discouraged me, especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to reunite, despite their age difference now. After that, however, the film succeeds in finishing as satisfyingly as possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral until the end. There was great potential with this story and the scenes in the sky are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the movie is not great. For a better and similar movie, try "Heaven Can Wait". Decent, but I really wish I had not seen it because of the second half scenes. ***
