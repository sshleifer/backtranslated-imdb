The Dominion Tank Police has not the slightest doubt, one of the most incredible shows ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of action and fun, the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in exactly the same way as the first part. The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the complexities of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, the Bonaparte tank literally jumps over a tank carcass and makes no sense. One can also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the Helicopter Gunship wing, even though it is legal. Buaku rules.
