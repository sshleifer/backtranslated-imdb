The first mystery is to guess what Welles's original film was like. This makes this a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and to use cinematic expertise, imagine the beautiful woman she has already supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you'll see and experience, perhaps, one of the best mystery movies ever. As the mysteries go, the narrative is quite common: a simple detour, a jealous husband like red herring. <br /> <br /> What is rather miraculous is putting Welles's story into an artificial eye by seeing a dark and multifaceted world. The first true noir, but even more somber. It's not an obviously distorted world, unless you think of the camera. What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become commonplace. <br /> <br /> For the whole celebration, Kane was a success because of the great drama and history. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the narrative of mystery and the self-reference of Shakespeare with that look. Othello and Macbeth are both initiated in this period, and I consider them part of a single vision with this. <br /> <br /> The noir sensation here depends on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives, even if they are a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So in telling this story, Welles needs to turn the environment into a character. Various characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> So we have the famous lighting, blocking and angles that we know (and we've seen it countless times). And we have the deliberately enclosed sets: the park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and funhouse. I am sure that what was cut down by the barbarians was a lot and a lot of 'external' narrative, which does not deal with character, but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the mystery is that the amusement house did this, among other environments of characters introduced as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of the Black Irishman (which we know from notes and a scene typing in the union hall was an aspiring novelist) was neither a conspiracy force of man (the park or the civilized version, the court) nature. (the picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of the gods' deliberate whim for fun. Of course this is a self-reference to what Welles is doing: putting these people (including himself) in hell for our own whim, a matter highlighted by the Beijing Opera with Dope Welles. And of course, leading to the amusement house, where the environment interferes directly with the perception. <br /> <br /> More about self-referral: there is certainly a conscious comment about your relationship with your future ex-wife. But I believe there is a strong subconscious comment about it itself triggering the environment in which it worked, the studio environment. Sure enough, Welles was as involved with it as his character. And this trance took the form of the murder of this movie, leaving the corpse rotted mentioned at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> That poor Rita comes from China ties everything up, the Chinese theater, the expected rape from above, the loss of the woman. Investment in the environment beyond anything.
