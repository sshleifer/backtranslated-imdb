First, in defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly mistimed as Alyce, the British young woman who plays the leading role. Fontaine makes an attractive photo as the heroine here, but her inexperience in acting is poorly displayed and her dance is best not mentioned. Fortunately, she's gotten better. <br /> <br /> But here are FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN, who are at the top of the list - and they are excellent. Burns & Allen fans will be amazed at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. Especially interesting is the great and fun routine of the house that won the choreographer Hermes Pans, an Oscar. They join Astaire in what has to be the most inventive highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is not much to say about the slow pace of the story - nor some of the difficult situations that require a lot of time. patience of the viewer. It should be said that part of the humor is unsatisfying and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period receive conventional treatment. Only musical interludes give history the impetus it needs. <br /> <br /> Some nice songs from Gershwin come up every now and then, but not all of them get the treatment they deserve. The good supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner, in his best polished performance as conniving, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father mistaken for a gardener by Astaire). <br /> <br /> Whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days. Both are surprisingly adept at following the footsteps of Astaire. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine's dance number with Fred is filmed at a discreet distance, but a clever camera job can not disguise the fact that she's out of his element as an Astaire dance partner, something that she seems painfully aware of.
