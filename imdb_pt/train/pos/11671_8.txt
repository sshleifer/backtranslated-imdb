"Against All Flags" is the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements that the adventure fan could expect and more, in this, the damsel in danger is, well, not really in danger. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her best, challenging the social norms of the period. Anthony Quinn completes the top three billed actors as the relentless Captain Roc Brasiliano and proves to be an astute and capable foe for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure fan, "Against All Flags" is a must-see. Although it may not be the same league as some of Errol Flynn's previous work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it's still a fun joke.
