You've been in your life, gone out to a sport activity, tried your best, and then found yourself in an important segment of it, where for a brief moment you had the chance to be a hero and a champion and. . . failed? I believe many of us have had this moment in our lives. This is the premise of the movie "The Best of Times". In this story, a middle-aged banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) suffers from the deep melancholy of a football error that happened years ago and is inspired to repeat the game. . again. To achieve this, he must convince once-great football quarterback Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to make a comeback. For Reno, who is satisfied with his present in life, it is not necessary to change past history, which is better as he ages. Added to both problems is the fact that the years have passed and, in addition, both marriages are struggling and need to be revitalized. It is not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) habitually reminds him of the greatest fall. However, Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try to fix the biggest mistake of his life. Lots of fun for those who want to enjoy youth again. ***
