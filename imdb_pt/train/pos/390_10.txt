The first thing I thought of when I saw these films was: It's not really a movie, at least not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "movie." is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So if you are not accustomed to expressing something in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it is just a fairy tale ... and even a Strange Chaotic For me, "The Legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like this. It tells us in pictures the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle that is as old as humanity, and everyone who is in search of meaning in this life is confronted with it. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the vision of the world and the human are different. But to the extent that we are all human and have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and can understand ourselves. It's a very beautiful film! And I've had more movies like this - movies that have a meaning. There are many empty stories that are good just to make time pass faster.
