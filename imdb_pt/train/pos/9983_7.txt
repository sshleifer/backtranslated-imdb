This film is basically about human relations and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who, in the twilight of her life, begins a journey to her past, making an analysis of how she lived her life. This day is precipitated because of the economic crisis of the children and their intentions to put it in an asylum. It's a very honest look at some issues we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are many secondary ideas to discuss in this film, such as family heirlooms, true love, marriage or destiny. Although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new, this can be helpful to watch with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance from the actors and the characters are very believable, but because of the time, some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
