The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic work, since the original poem was / is. The context / scenery with the old sailor is good, clear and unpretentious. The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly in the time / period of the scene and the work itself, taking the audience to the period with an accompaniment still mobile, using excellent strategies of movement of movements only well conquered by the public. producers of the pre-MTV era and much less apparent in more current works. (MTV brought to television and video a static movement that goes through often irrelevant cuts from theme to theme without moving forward and without clear relationships with theme or plot.) The voice, intonation and vitality of the Redgrave reading gives life to this touching poem with all its fear, struggle and pain. In addition, the smooth motion of the video emphasizes cadence and occasionally monotonous (in this case, a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the author's version of the sad and scary tale of the former sailor. This is a must for any love of classical poetry, the sea, a tall tale, which almost sounds true and a story that left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A truly good experience. Thank you Mr. DaSilva for bringing this to life for us, never to be forgotten again.
