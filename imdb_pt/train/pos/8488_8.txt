I just have to play my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, in most cases, the characters are widely written and acted out. I can not think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new version, it is on video and airs almost every week. Would I see in a theater? Of course, when he left for the first time. It's funny ... that should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I did not like it, I would still watch the telegram for Michael Keaton. He is an underestimated and underrated actor. I can not think of anyone who is so capable in all genres. I can not even think of someone who is so successful. A comedic actor who is also an action star (short but still), who is also a romantic leader who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. I can not think of anything, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly no one who has had success in all these genres. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, but to me he's better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I'll move on. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting, it pays to buy because you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less in stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth watching on the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun watching movies. You can put your brain on break and just relax and laugh. <br /> <br /> Asking for more, in my honest opinion, is asking too much.
