I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see it. A clever and slightly distorted comedy that makes you think. I was not sure how a director can create "anything", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals in C.O.R.E. to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as anything can be). It is worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You'll be glad you did it.
