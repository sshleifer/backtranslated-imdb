New York, I love you is a collective work of eleven short films, with each segment running around 10 minutes long. Shorts do not relate exactly, but they all have something in common, love. Each short is about finding love, be it about a couple or just two strangers chatting. The film starring Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise, I was expecting an incredible movie; The problem is that New York I Love You does not add up. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny, original and interesting, but others are so nonsensical (segments of Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q) that is shocking. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. In terms of history, it seems something that some film students could muster. That said, the film also has great moments, one of the best being the segment about an old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who walks in Brooklyn on his 67th wedding anniversary. And it's moments like this, that made me as a spectator, I wish the film were more consistent, because there is so much potential here. But as unsatisfactory as the general story is, for me, cinematography and soundtrack have saved everything. The editing was perfect, the way the film was filmed was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack could not be more appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You looks like an experimental film and, like most experiences, there are ups and downs. It's like looking at the film as a whole, it determines whether he likes it or not. It may be worth it for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
