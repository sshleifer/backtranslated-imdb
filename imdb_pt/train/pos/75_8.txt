The great Vincent Price has made many fantastic Horror films, some of which are among the greatest genre gems of all time. Price's greatest achievements were undoubtedly his films in the 1960s, with films such as Roger Corman's brilliant Poe cycle (still the greatest Horror cycle of all time), Michael Reeves's "Witchfinder General" (1968) or "The Last Man" by Ubaldo Ragona. on Earth "(1964), marking the last highlights of this brilliant man's career.The films that made the man famous and thus made him the immortal Horror icon he is, nevertheless go back to the 1950s with" House of Wax " (1953) marking his rise to stardom. "The Mad Magician" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor. Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and although I personally would not allow myself to lose anything of what the man was, none of my fellow man fans can miss this little gem. Price-stars like Don Galico (also known as Galico the Great), an underestimated magician and inventor of magical devices, whose boss, a despicable businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from him. take one of the ingenious s Galico's inventions and surrender to his rival, The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico clings, and a murderous wave of revenge begins ... <br /> <br /> We do not love Vincent Price when he's out of revenge? Some of his greatest and most famous films, such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973), dealt with absurd and deliciously macabre murders of revenge, and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that Nobody takes revenge like Vincent Price. This film provides a wonderfully eccentric lead role for Price, who, as always, delivers brilliant performance and ensures 70 minutes of outrageously fun and macabre fun for all Horror fans. Another must-see for my Price fans.
