This is a brilliant contribution made by a group of fans, and considering that it is done in a back room on a painted green screen, the story lines are complex and sinuous, and their characters show realistic depth and dimension. The CGI created by the crew is breathtaking. While the first season may be a bit unstable, the latter are well thought out and well filmed. Some fans may have thought the Star Trek franchise has come to an end with Enterprise's early cancellation, but these fans will not take no for an answer. I recommend this to fans and newcomers, 10/10 hidden border crew. <br /> <br /> Do so ...
