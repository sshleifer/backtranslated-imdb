I took it arbitrarily out of the library the other night, having no idea of ​​the cult of the film, influence, or which is being staged as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a little explorer, despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who has loved it when it left. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that kind of disappeared, you can hear in old movies of Jackie O too; people just do not talk like that anymore. I think, as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the house fell into disrepute; Old Edie, at least, still seems aware of what is happening to some extent; Could not she see the once spectacular house disintegrating? <br /> <br /> However, the subject of the film is the life that the two women have built for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams an act. Worth your time.
