This very funny British comedy shows what can happen if a section of London, in this case Pimlico, declares itself independent of the rest of the UK and its postwar laws, taxes and restrictions. Jolly disorder is what would happen. <br /> <br /> The explosion of a war bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a little historical note long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as the politician of the smaller city who suddenly finds himself leading one of the smallest nations in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as the history teacher who stands next to Pimlico. Others in the cast include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
