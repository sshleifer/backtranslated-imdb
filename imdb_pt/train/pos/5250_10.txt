The world is formed by two different types of spectators ... There are the types of "English patients," who can not bother to enjoy anything that is not high enough to appear on PBS, and there are "Happy Gilmore" types, for whom an hour and a half of genital puns are definitely worth the $ 7. <br /> <br /> Surely, there's a ton of gray area, but you know which side you're leaning on. If you are an English Patient, save your time, save your money and save all your comments. "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid." I know, you like to belittle all the movies you do not like, and all the people who like them, but maybe you can just postpone this time. <br /> <br /> But if you're the Happy Gilmore type. .. go see this one ... You will find hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be hilarious in just about everything he does. Go take a look. You'll be glad you did it. And that's fine.
