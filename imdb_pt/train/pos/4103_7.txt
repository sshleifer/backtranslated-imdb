The main characters of this film fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays a clumsy and stupid guy who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to be repaid financially by his evil ex-boss, the situation gets out of control. <br /> <br /> While Standa is genuinely (but lovingly) stupid, his friend Ondrej is a jerk who suffocates everything and can say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa may have the chance to go through life with some degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it certainly will not be without a lot of headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, a kind of evil genius who degenerates into some delirious tyrant of Hitler-esque. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed by the high quality and imagination of the Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly produced more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.
