The first one was good and original. I was not a bad horror / comedy movie. Then I heard that a second was done and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this movie work is Judd Nelson's character and the sometimes clever script. A very good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was fine. Sometimes there are scenes in what looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy look. <br /> <br /> Great movie made for TV. It was worth renting and probably worth buying just to have that weird feeling and see Judd Nelson's Stanley doing what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest the newcomers watch the first before watching the sequence, you'll get an idea of ​​what Stanley is and have a bit of background.
