All I can remember about this was excellent ... great cast with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before it became more familiar to the US public) .... excellent scripts like only English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion-type mysteries, but with a touch of Jules Verne. Something like MacGyver would have been if it had been in England 80 years before ... well at the beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. I always wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows . MacGyver aired for the first time about 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a very deteriorated tape.
