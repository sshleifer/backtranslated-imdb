Destroyed with guilt after many things have parted on that ledge, an ace mountaineer rescue mountaineer Gabriel Walker (Stallone) returns to his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while over the overcast sky where the weather seems a bit threatening, spectacularly precarious kidnapping in the air goes wrong and $ 100 million taken from a Treasury plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a forced landing ?? Stranded off the snowy peaks, and needing mountain guides to regain stolen money, do highly trained hikers make an emergency call for help from a rescue unit? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to unite to get to the crash site without knowing that the distress call was false, and a bunch of ruthless terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow ), are they waiting for them just to find a way out of the stormy mountain with cases dumped money? With breathtaking shots, dizzying landscapes, dizzying heights, dangerous climbs, freezing temperatures, "Cliffhanger" is definitely Stallone's best action and adventure film?
