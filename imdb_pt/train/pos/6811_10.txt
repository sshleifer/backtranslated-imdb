Although I generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this movie is an exception. I did not know until now to read the previous comment that this was a remake, so my opinion is purely about the movie and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written is undoubtedly: it is the Capote. No need for more words. <br /> <br /> The play by Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb. I've seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure that they are good actors and in the case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is the number 1 star and not his brother. This time, this certainty is raised to the fact, no doubt. His play, as well as Edwards' play, is clearly the best of their profession. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to be in your 50 movies to see and keep on the shelves of your DVD.
