I could never remember the name of this show. I used to watch it when I was 8 years old. I remember staying up late when I should not be alone to watch this show. It was the best show for me. As far as I remember, it's still great. This showed starring Lucas Black, making him the first boy I ever had a crush on. I'm from the country, so kids with an accent have no appeal to me, but to him I'd definitely make an exception. That after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift you should see why. He is a great actor and has been since he was a child. I miss this show and would like it back. If anyone has seen where they are selling the season, please send me an email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
