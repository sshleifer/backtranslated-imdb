I would not like to comment on how good the film was or what the flaws were since I'm not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge to make movies. What I do know is that making this kind of movie in your first scene is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director for that. However, in some reviews, which I read, critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his siblings was not highlighted, and his siblings were completely erased from history. Now I would really like to raise a point here that, as the movie name suggests, is not a movie about the Hiralal brothers, it's a movie about the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing less. If we start complaining about some of the characters being kept out of action in the movie, it would be a little unfair because those characters do not fit the picture, no matter how relevant they are in real life. So, I think it would be better if we kept the main idea and stopped satisfying a critic in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
