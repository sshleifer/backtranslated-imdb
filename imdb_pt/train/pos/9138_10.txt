I own this movie and watched it over and over over the years since it was released. Prince does not stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel that's what he showed here, he's just the best to tell that story through influence. Most of this film is direct and youthful, but that's the fault of the directors / writers, but it's still a great movie with even better music. The moral principles and beliefs in Purple Rain are quite strong, and if more films rely on the basics we learn as children, we would have a better environment everywhere, since art reflects life that reflects art.
