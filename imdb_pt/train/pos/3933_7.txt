The problem in portraying a real-life individual is that performance may be good, but it still does not work if the audience does not believe the actor is portraying the person. That's the main question with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives a fantastic performance, but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as gentle as Fonda portrays him. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a court drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether or not this is a true story, I do not know, but if it is not, then why say using Lincoln as a central character? It does not matter, though. In the film, Lincoln is defending two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There is not really much for the movie and as a result it seems quite empty. I wanted more story and character development. The movie is 100 minutes long, but it does not look like it. There are some small scenes with Lincoln and the flourishing relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem shallow. <br /> <br /> Performance is good everywhere, but as I said, Fonda's performance works as a character, but not like Abraham. Lincoln. I just can not believe the real Lincoln was soft-spoken. It is true that he has a great voice when he needs it, as when he persuades a crowd of drunken lynchers to let the accused be tried, but Fonda portrays Lincoln with great humility. The other performances are solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She's a good lady we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think of this movie as an epic, and at the time of its release, it probably was. But even so, there is not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a good watch, but not a classic.
