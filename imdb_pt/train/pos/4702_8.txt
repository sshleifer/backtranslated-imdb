If this movie proves only one thing, it is that Keaton is, has always been and always will be a comic at heart, even when dodging bullets, going to the electric chair and reaching the wrong side of a line of information in prison. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" continues to prove even more so. In the 1980s, ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the heyday in the world of gender spoofs. But there were several suitors to the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High") Heckerling tries his hand, with an incredible amount of television writers behind the script (go and check it out). <br /> <br /> This slap-happy parody of cop movies from the 1930s films plays "all the cliches by a loop and even adds a few cliches that did not exist long ago." And not just the ever-reliable Keaton is at hand as Johnny of the title, but they are also faces and funny puppets like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost all of the other actors in Hollywood who happen to have walked in the immediate vicinity. I'd be surprised how many faces you'll recognize I know I did <br /> <br /> And the jokes Well, when they start, they come to you fast and furious like a machine gun.There are many to tell in the beginning, <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> " a lot of the time.At the end though, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes might have been funnier - usually not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there's nothing good on TV, pop in "Johnny" and be ready for some "dangerously" serious laughter. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerously" ... do not be a "bastidge".
