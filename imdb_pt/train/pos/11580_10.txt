As another reviewer states that Hanna's War is a featured film about a prominent person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, diverge in the opinion of not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the leadership is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In fact, for me, her performance is not retained by her beauty, but it makes even more obvious the terror of sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. Maruschka Detmers' performance is brave, pungent, sincere or understood, and totally believable. In other words, for me "in the zone". of opening credits. If you would like to learn about someone's suffering for something you believe in and have a great time, try Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers. My hat also went to Ellen Burstyn, as Hanna's mother, a famous and famous actress who could have made an effort to come out with the film. As far as it is a team effort, maybe two actresses, but not an All About Eve situation.
