I am neither father nor man. But I was able to identify with the pains and sufferings of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teens should watch. Perhaps this way you will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. I am sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see a 19-year-old Ben Affleck doing his best in a moving and heartfelt performance. He showed at a young age that he is capable of sincere drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in years and he came out and won the Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. This film can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Maybe it should not be seen by children under 10 because they may be afraid that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it with friends many times. Because it portrays the values ​​that are important in life.
