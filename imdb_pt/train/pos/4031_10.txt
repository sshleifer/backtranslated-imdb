I've been a Hindi movie fan since I was 4 years old, but never in my life have I seen such a moving and shocking movie, especially as a Hindi movie. In recent years, I stopped watching Hindu contemporary films and came back to watch the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found not only to be on the move but also found it very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America. This helped me understand the story of my own family, which has always been something very abstract to me. But to "see," feel, and understand, it has helped me empathize with the generations before me and the struggle that the Indians faced. The film has helped put a lot of things in perspective for me, especially considering the current world events. I never thought a movie could change the way I think like that before. The plot is fantastic, the acting superb and the direction is flawless. Two thumbs up!
