Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in this takeoff of gangster films made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays her sick mother, Griffin Dunne is her DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays an animal store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him in flashback how he came to own the pet store. He turned to the still young theft to do pancreatic surgery for his mother ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a mafia boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerously" in the criminal world. <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a riot like Johnny's dirty mouth mother who needs any organ in her body replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss makes a very funny presentation, as does Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA who does not "play ball" with Burr (Danny De Vito). Like Johnny's enemy, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to listen to him instead of reading about it. What makes it funny is that it does everything with a face of rage. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a little tired in the end, but it's worth seeing, and Keaton is great as good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this movie was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's other jewel, "Night Shift," you do not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are true gems, you'll find Johnny Dangerously immensely nice.
