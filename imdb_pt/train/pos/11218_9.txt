This anime is a must-see for Evangelion fans. It is an earlier work by Anno Hideaki, but his dramatic and unbridled style is well in place. Also, those who did not like Evangelion may find this version a bit more palatable. Gunbuster is quite unique to science fiction anime, in that it is actually based on real science. In fact, the program has several small "science class" interludes explaining the physics behind some of the movie's events. One of the great dramatic points of the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to that of light. The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the traumatic experience of leaving Earth on a six-month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an Earth where ten years have passed. The main character remains 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters age considerably. Be warned, this show is heavy on sap sometimes. He also has some of the most totally undeserved breast shots I've ever seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore the uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is very good, but viewers with low sap tolerance may want to stay away from this. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last two episodes. However, they have managed to use black and white films and still sketches of action to produce a good resolution anyway. The ending is a little silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut that I could not help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best Anime pieces out there.
