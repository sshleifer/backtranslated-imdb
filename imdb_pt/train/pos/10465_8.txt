Even early in her career, Capra was quite accomplished with her camera work and her timing. This is a fine story - and quite predictable at times - but it gets great performances from its cast and has some rather intricate camera movements that wrap the viewer intimately. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, though anyone with a brain can see that the bottom will fall out of it - the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, because of his good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in the clich√©s. So the film becomes more original, since the couple needs to find a way to make a living. The ending is very predictable but satisfactory. I also want to praise the title writing: very witty and fun.
