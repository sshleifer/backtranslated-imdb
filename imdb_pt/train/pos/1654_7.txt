Soap Opera on a small married town (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, plays the lead in her local theater but dreams of becoming a Broadway star. When a famous actor, who is a ham, a bag of wind and a womanizer, arrives in the city, she visits him in his room with his dreams giving tips to the stardom - he pretends that his servant is his "manager" cheating her to believe she has all that is needed, but "experience" to become a great star. Her husband discovers and punches the guy, resulting in the unexpected death of the actor - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a sentence of life imprisonment for a husband. The next thing you know is that she has joined a roving burlesque show hoping to one day get to Broadway and make enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk! <br /> <br /> This movie has a very interesting, well, a little exaggerated, perhaps, but very melodramatic storyline (with tons of melodramatic music to ensure that you get it) - all very much enhanced by strong emotional performance given by Kay Francis - she just does this movie. Also helping here is the well-made acting of Minna Gombell in her role as a "more or less forty" older woman who works with the burlesque and befriends Kay. Worth seeing, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
