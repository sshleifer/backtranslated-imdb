Undoubtedly intended as a totally exaggerated joke, "Full Moon High" portrays 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin), accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony gets bitten and creates hair and fangs whenever there is a full moon. One particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it can not grow old as long as it has the curse of the werewolf, and that it has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, the movie is just plain funny when it starts. Ed McMahon's character is a right-wing yahoo super-patriot (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's tech / director is a tense boredom and then there's more. One of the most revealing cast members is Demond Wilson - most remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who has a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the change of presidents; then gagging with Gerald Ford really summed it up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Whereas Alan Arkin - who plays a crazy psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his kids, I wonder if he remembers or did not remember two of them in this movie (besides Adam, his son Anthony also a small paper). Pretty funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the killer movie "It's Alive."
