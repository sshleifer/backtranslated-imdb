I saw and I like Melissa plays the part of her well. It was really believable. My brother-in-law saw it with my sister and I and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot it was based on a true story (I had seen this a few years ago.) He said just because your life you think is true E both my sister and I were like that anyway I wanted to know if anyone knew what murder was or how who was really involved was because I want to prove it to him. I love life movies, especially those that are true, or just those who teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where any help would be appreciated.
