Dog days is one of the most accurate films I have ever seen describing life in modern cities. It is very hard and cruel at some points and, unfortunately, is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional dead-ends, problematic issues, perversion, complexes, madness. All the things that are present in the great advanced cities of today. This makes you realize once again the state of pity where people lead society. <br /> <br /> The downside of city life has never been portrayed on screen so appropriately. I just wanted it to be a lie. Unfortunately it is not. So ... 10/10.
