Not wanting to give anything here, I would say that this technically excellent, flawless and inspiring little flick will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half of entertainment: he will amuse, amaze, possibly occasionally embarrass and almost certainly tow in the strings of the heart of sometimes, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clich√©d or predictable anyway. Most definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> Comment from a previous reviewer gives 8 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for both the outstanding performances of Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I fully agree ....
