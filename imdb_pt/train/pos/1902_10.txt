Let's start with this theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you're caught between the moon and the city of New York." It's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiresome. It really is a great song about New York City too. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is involved with the character of Jill Eikenberry in the movie. Jill would later star in LA Law. Anyway, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Oscar for his performance in the film as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls for the character of Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, in addition to his performance in his role in the Oscar of Cabaret. No, Liza can not sing. She plays a restaurant waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach matriarch of the family who decides the family fortune. Anyway, she's fabulous and should have been nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Award. Barney Martin, better known as Jerry's father in Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He's great too. The film was well written, presented and delivered to the public who wanted more.
