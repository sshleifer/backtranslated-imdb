Famous words from foreign nightclub owner Roman Maroni, that "bad cork sucker" who passes the whole movie not only as Johnny Dangerously's adversary but also massacring the English language. Another understated classic that you can only find in late matinees or "Late Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is a great satirical hit about a good-hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother through law school. <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There are lots of laughs to put here. Like the plane, you have to pay attention or you will miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
