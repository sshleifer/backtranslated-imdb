This is a very funny, easy-to-watch movie that entertains you almost all the time. The director's work is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical story of police partners as a deadly weapon, but the jokes and comedies are of an Argentine type. The difference is that one of them is a psychologist interpreted by Peretti and has to go with Detective Diaz (played by Luque) in his tasks, while he also helps him (Diaz is disturbed because his wife betrayed him). Some of the dialogues are hilarious around the world: understandable and laughable anywhere. It's very good overall, it deserved an 8, but I rated 7 because it gets a little low in the end. On a personal note, I must add that he is a "brave" to Argentine filmmakers, considering that the little good is coming lately.
