I'm not very good at writing reviews, so I just explain my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series in the beginning. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I found everything brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Apparently, Davis was the fifth most important person in the cast. It is not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of Season Seven, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I do not know if it's because Hammond was more important than I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to shit. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, however, was fearful. The Stargate movie looked mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out to be, even if that was not the original intention, a brilliant setup for the series. I recommend you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll get a new recognition from it the second time, believe me), and then watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. It just means it's a disappointment if you've been spoiled for the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After finishing this series, do not forget to watch the series of spin offs, Stargate: Atlantis. He is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It is a great loss.
