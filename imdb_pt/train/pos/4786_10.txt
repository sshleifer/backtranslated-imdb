The Straight Story is the story of an elderly man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the border. He decides to make the trip on his lawn mower as he can not drive and he wants to make the rip for it. The film beautifully portrays his journey and the lives he touches along the way. Richard Farnsworth performs in a fine performance as the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in a catchy performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but endlessly crucial role. At first I felt that the story of an old man's trip around the country would be monotonous, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all the insights of man's life, makes this film a movie that I would recommend to anyone.
