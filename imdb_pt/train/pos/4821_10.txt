One of those wonderfully intense movies that draws us so intimately, ends very soon! Than they stared at the screen like, "No, they did not!", Lol. Good performances around! The acting is wonderful with Emily Blunt simply amazing! I knew she would give a solid and convincing performance, picking up the regalia, temperament and vulnerability of young Victoria throughout the film. In addition, the production is excellent in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in the history of Britain counted through a very personal and moving biography of the princess of school age until her reign as Queen, later marrying Prince Albert, than ending with the birth of her first nine children. It had a well-written script and a perfect edition. Rupert Friend, as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert, vied for the attention of the young queen, instead of securing his love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was captivating. Equally captivating was the relationship between the adolescent Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes furious, like her mother and King William (who also did not like her mother). The acting and the scenes were captivating, highly emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation that existed at that time, and indeed, anyone who loves a true romance story
