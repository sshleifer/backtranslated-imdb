Shinjuku Triad Society: It is unlikely that the Chinese Mafia Wars will be distributed in the West outside of the film festivals. Because? Could their censors manipulate a film in which police analgesically rape men and women to convince them to talk (and victims have fun) or see an old woman with the eye torn from the skull? These are just a few of the shocks anticipated for viewers in this ultra-violent history of cops and gangsters. It makes Orange Clockwork, which was banished for years in the UK resembling a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie? YES It is a fantastic and essential vision for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what happens in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure you get Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except the insane end in the DOA, of course). Great for Japan they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this movie outside of Takashi Miike's retrospective at a film festival is on DVD. If I did not try to look for a version of Hong Kong on the web, I'm sure it will leave the country.
