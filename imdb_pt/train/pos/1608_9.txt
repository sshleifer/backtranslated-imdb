Watching "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this movie was when it first appeared. Who knew Cher could act? Who has heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director. <br /> <br /> The only really flat note in this splendid work is "When The Moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, which is Amore," a song that is sung many times in the movie (once already is too much) and that he went on to have a long afterlife in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges, offering him his pinky ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, and runs to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He charges Loretta that his brother, Ronny, attend the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) is betraying his mother (Olympia Dukakis), whom Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything works out in the end, as inevitably happens. in movies of this genre. Meanwhile, all the actors benefit admirably and the audience has fun. On his way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood used to be the best: entertaining entertainment without any social significance. If they had just lost "That's Amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.
