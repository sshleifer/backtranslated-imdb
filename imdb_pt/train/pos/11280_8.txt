A very interesting entertainment, with the charm of the old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment demands, and we all enjoy his success with it. The most interesting thing for me is a man with no special powers facing the problems and beating them only with human abilities (he was a great swimmer and had a great cry)
