In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington has a true story that is also a very difficult story and brings to the screen with an honesty we expect from Washington's efforts, but now we see that touch as director. <br /> <br /> We have recently seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen into the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars, but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can solve some initial problems with many closes and not the best to edit these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project this power can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the gym ignores this movie, it will be a scam. This movie does not make any punches and goes to the hard facts of the story with a purity that normally does not transcend from a novel to the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so go see and tell your friends to come and see too!
