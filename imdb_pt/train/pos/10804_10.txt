Trapped in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel showing it right at the beginning. Pachelbel's first Canon brought a lump to my throat, so the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I flew) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then the name of Crowe hooked me completely. I was delighted with this film, Crowe's performance (again, the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we have), how various subjects were covered and treated, the flight sequences (my father also piloted Avro Ansons), history - and , as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I will not spoil the movie for anyone but separated from my wife by 4,000 miles, as a former army officer who was put on a couple of wars and as a private pilot, I admit to crying willingly a few times. . Buy, rent, download, beg, borrow or steal - but look. <br /> <br /> PS I peeked a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the floor? It looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a double Browning 303 in a dorsal turret.
