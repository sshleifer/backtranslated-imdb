With films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" on their resume, good people across the pond, Aardman Animation, are now showing us some of their distorted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts." Derived from an early short in their careers, "Creature Comforts" is a living show in which snatches of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort. Aardman Animation went through the country interviewing people with innocuous questions like, "Are you a liar?" and then speed things up a bit by asking about their sex lives. <br /> <br /> The answers, although they seem boring and mundane, are really very funny, when you understand that the dialogues come first and the animals are added later. How many of these animals look like the person making the statements? One of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman: "I like them kind of thin." is an insect, the Bengal. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs discussing odors and smells while sniffing the backside of a poodle as they talk about a woman's different scents. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. As the "wife" tells the litany that is her health, her long suffering husband stands beside her, saying nothing. <br /> <br /> While it may take some time for "Comfort Creature" to find its "legs", it should find a spot on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there are more reality shows than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and definitely worth watching. Part of the humor may seem a bit cheeky, it's the claymation that catches the attention of children (like the old Batman series of the 60's, the jokes are subtle enough for kids not to get) and are the jokes that are there for adults.
