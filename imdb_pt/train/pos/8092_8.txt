I came across this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold and dark November afternoon. I was outside joking all day, freezing, and when I got there around 4 in the afternoon, I drank a cup of hot chocolate and sat down in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not all happy and silly - and, in fact, it was bleak and moralistic. It captured my imagination. I'm sure the text is missing and abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. But it still captures the spirit of history, the choice to carry a burden for the good of others, the consequences of hasty and selfish decisions, and so on. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaints. But the only place where this film clearly rises above the new films is the characterizations of the voice. John Hurt is great at it. If you do not like how the character is drawn, look away and just hear it. Your voice is extraordinary. I have seen it again many, many times and it always brings me back to that time as a child, thirsty for some magical adventure. It is for this reason that I say "luck", the film is nostalgic for me, so I ignore its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, she still caught up with me and still does.
