I had no problem with the film, which I thought was very good. It's the video of the Los Angeles police crime scene that disturbed me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY felt that the general audience would like to see people who were brutally beaten to death and with blood all over the place. Sorry Lion's Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA !!! Returning to the film: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was lousy, mistreating the women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he is desperately steeped in drugs. His connection with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous murders of Wonderland. Exactly how much Holmes was involved in the murders? We may never know the full truth of the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the film does a good job anyway.
