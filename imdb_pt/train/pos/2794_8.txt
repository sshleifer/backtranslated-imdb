How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This does this with an almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures also do not want their daughters to be small. Here we see a bunch of superb actors that we've never heard of before portraying people from different cultures living rather monotonous lives until the female children want and have the potential to become professional soccer players. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both are silly too). One flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives, but not a child among them.
