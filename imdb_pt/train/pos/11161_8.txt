This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if this translates into other languages ​​or not. However, I think men from all over the world can identify with "Frank" and his thoughts to some extent! These thoughts are extremely funny and women will also like this movie, I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All cast members perform well, and this movie could have been a tremendous success all over the world had it been made in England. or the US. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are a treat! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
