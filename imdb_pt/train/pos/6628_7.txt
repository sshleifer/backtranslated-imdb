I saw this movie on avant-premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, I was waiting to see the final result. I was not dissapointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full 3D movie with high contrast black-and-white rendering. Clearly inspired by some comics, such as those by F. Miller. In this perspective, it goes a step beyond the excellent adaptation "City of Sin" by R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no gray or any color in the middle, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film (I can not wait for the scanner somberly) <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we soon forget the technical aspect to focus on more classic elements such as direction or plot. The steering remains sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and this is really a good surprise. <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer interested to the end. Although a classic storyline (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations) the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms ...) give this film a great interest. <br /> <br /> is an animated film, this is obviously not made for children. You will not find here any funny pet or any stupid family morality, just cold reality. It's a lot closer to a good noir movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the scenery is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel the familiar Paris, but it is transformed by a touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> However, I regret some mistakes. The montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very slow-motion effects and a few clich√©d dialogues. Even though the coach is excellent, he shows his limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasy"). These little things make it a 7/10. <br /> <br /> In total, it is a successful artistic challenge that you need to observe if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential pitfalls (fortunately, they did not ask John Woo to do the job!). <br /> <br /> To conclude, it's a film with explosive visual effects, a clever story and a wonderful art direction. Watch if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for typos.
