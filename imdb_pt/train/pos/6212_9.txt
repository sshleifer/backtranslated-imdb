I have a deep appreciation for this film, although it seems deliberately less "polite" than the other Fred and Ginger films, not to mention Harriet Hillard's slightly problematic cast in the lead romantic role. <br /> <br /> Once again with these films, the plot is of lesser importance - Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who is a brilliant old hulk (of course!)) and Rogers an aspiring performer decadent dime-a-dance music. Although their relationship is bright and fun to watch, they are bogged down by a main story not involving Hilliard and Randolph Scott, who could not find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hilliard was a bit of an evil eyebrow, since she does not have the presence onscreen to give this movie what it needs, though it's sweet and pleasant. all the time. The film may have benefited from promoting Lucille Ball's character for a larger role, as she simply shone on every little scene, and would have made a big side kick from Helen Broderick to Rogers in this kind of brilliant film (See 'Stage Door ', made the following year, for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). That Scott's one-dimensional Neanderthal character eventually falls in love with Hilliard is even harder to believe than Astaire is in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Now, the important part, singing and dancing: nothing more can be said about "Let's face music and dance", besides being brilliant, moving and perfectly executed, and I usually finish To watch that scene With tears in my eyes. However, other songs in the film also deserve some recognition; "I'm putting all my eggs in a basket" is a fine example of the comedic instincts of Astaire and Rogers, and almost mocks his reputation for exploding into spontaneous, perfectly synchronized dance. Other highlights include "I'd Rather Lead the Band" and "Let Yourself Go," which show how these two talents can perform as brilliantly alone as together. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) times when we see Astaire playing brilliantly on the piano; It seems that the talents of this man were infinite! <br /> <br /> Overall, I really prefer this to 'Top Hat' and 'Swing Time' (though just fair), as it is more earthy and touched so enthusiastically by all involved, it's hard not to like the factor fun.
