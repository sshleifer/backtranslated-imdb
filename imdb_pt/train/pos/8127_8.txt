While a little preaching on the subject of progress as the saving grace of mankind, this is still an impressive film that presages the science fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to reach the movie screen. He predicts the global chaos of World War II but expands the premise of having the conflict last for 30 years and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle beneath the debris and jungle of space. The acting looks wooden and strangely sterile, but perhaps this is a result of its contrast with the visuals that must have been absolutely stunning at the time of the film's release, and which still impress today. This is a movie that should not be overlooked by anyone interested in the SF genre.
