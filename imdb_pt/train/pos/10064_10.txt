The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that puts the family's gender preference against men against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930's China during a period of floods, we find Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the fear of all who witness it. When a famous opera artist sees and then becomes friends with Wang, he invites Wang to join his troupe. However, we have learned that Wang's family tradition allows him to simply pass on his secrets to a child. Learning that Wang has no children, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the spell is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, Wang buys an 8-year-old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art. <br /> <br /> Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The scenery is serene and the clothes simple. In short, it is an International Prize-winning art film that can not help but move and inspire.
