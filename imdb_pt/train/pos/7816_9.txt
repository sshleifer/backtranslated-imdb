Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with Oscar winner 'Gandhi' in '83. I did not know of any other work of his until I recently met 'Cry Freedom', released in 1987. Although it was not as popular as his Gandhi, is as exciting, if not more so, and was released when South Africa had not yet freed itself from the shackles of apartheid. While most of the films on social issues appear after the event happened, I think this movie was released over time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real-life characters and events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the late seventies. He traces the origins of Woods' friendship with charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is beautifully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and presence on the screen, which Biko's character demanded. <br /> <br /> Although initially Woods was against what he thought black racism was being spread by Biko, after meeting the man, he could not help but draw in his struggles and ideas. The bond between them strengthens, and Woods and his family realize and become more sensitive to the situation of the people Biko represents. <br /> <br /> However, finally, the tragedy strikes, and Woods should now focus on escaping South Africa with his book, so he can publish it and let the outside world know what is happening. The second half of the film is an exciting story of his escape from South Africa along with his family, and will keep him on suspensions. <br /> <br /> There are some delightfully humorous dialogues as well. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in court is an example. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you advocate violence? Biko: I defend a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, is not this violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I are having a confrontation now, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are times that bring you back to the horrors that permeated the country before a better sense prevailed. The scene in which the army opens fire on a protest of school children is painful and devastating. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a must-see. I would suggest to those who are unfamiliar with the work of Attenborough, take the time to do this. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make lives. I would prefer any last day.
