Okay, here's the thing: if you take offense easily, you may want to stay away, far from it. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed as much as I laughed. In fact, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I was not literally flushed outside, then I was blushing inside. If there's absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you, then you just do not feel ashamed. Whether this is a badge of honor or not in the eye of the beholder, I suppose. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed a lot, but this is a movie that I just can not give a general recommendation because of its subject. If I said, "This movie is hilarious, go take a look!" and some elderly, kind ladies go to the theater and have a heart attack during one of the graphically explicit sexual situations, well, that's just something I do not need in my consciousness. <br /> <br /> So how dare you? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mother would have left during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. <br /> <br /> There's some clever smart comedy here, but it's what I expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a participation both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a chance for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, "If I hear Ya Mo Be There again, I'm going to burn this place," it's hilarious, but it's one of those things that most audiences will not like. <br /> <br /> And when we see a fast 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along with Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, while most everyone laughed and then forgot of this. <br /> <br /> Strangely, despite the presentation, there is an admirable morality in the story. The film does not portray Carrell as a freaky loser just because he is a virgin. He is actually portrayed as an admirable and admirable character. Of course, he's a little strange. After all, he has a framed poster in Asia, "more video games than an Asian kid," and a collection of toys that shows the Boss of the Million Dollar Man, but we're never led to believe that there's something wrong with him being a virgin. Oddly enough, there is a message "it's okay to wait." <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please be warned that this raises your R rating as much as possible. . This was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improvise and speak the way they normally speak, all in an effort to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can handle this or talk like that then you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of excessive jokes and sex. I think subtle and clever humor is a lot more fun than about 200 uses of sex discussions with the word f or fratboy. But it's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to wonder if they're worth watching one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to see in the movies. I just do not know how interested most women will be in what is discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly, ladies, you may not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think the boys are rude, well, that gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> There you go - my humble and honest opinion on what to expect. Be this your guide. Definitely not to be seen with your Sunday School class, Mom, Grandma, any member of the opposite sex family, children of any age, or anyone who is easily offended by excessive swearing or explicit sexual discussions. If you come up with any of the above, you apparently have no concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.
