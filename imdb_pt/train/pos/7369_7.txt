Personally I could not get into 'This is not a love song', it's a brilliant movie and there's a great story for it, I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much I loved the relationship between Spike and Heaton, so close they depend on each other to get along in life. At the same time, I would like the relationship to be more than it is. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is not in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. The acts of betrayal, on both sides, have a great effect on the two men. Both are devastated by the fact that the other fled and abandoned them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
