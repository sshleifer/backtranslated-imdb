The quote I used for my summary takes place in the middle of the GOOD LAND, as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a crowd for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters between them, as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course, the next looter about to be discovered and filmed is the main character of the film, the former kitchen slave O-Lan (whose representation Luise Rainer, now 99 years old, won her second best actress Oscar The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully handing over her looted jewelry bag to her poor husband, the farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), putting into practice the classic dichotomy of a man in financial ascendance, being the direct opposite of his moral decline. For a film about subjects such as slavery, false accusations, misogyny, starvation, home invasion, domestic animal feeding, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, mass street killings, bigamy, beating children, adultery, incest, and plagues of biblical proportions, THE BOA TERRA is a surprisingly thrilling film. My farewell thought is in the form of another classic quotation, of O-Lan herself (while putting up her son has just admitted that the theft of an elderly woman back to the cauldron after her husband, Wang Lung, threw her angrily on the dirt floor on the other side of his hut: "Meat is meat".
