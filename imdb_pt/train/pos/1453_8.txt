Well, there are many ways to ruin a political thriller. Usually they are derivative or very ambitious, they often present a conspiracy that is totally paranoid and unbelievable. But the City Hall does not do any of the above. The plot is cleverly crafted, the story is believable. As for the characters, I would say that this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as ever. His portrait of a charismatic New York mayor is superb and proves once again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of the American actors nowadays.
