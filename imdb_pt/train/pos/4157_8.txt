This initial anime movie was a pretty good movie that I once caught on the science fiction channel when the anime was really popular here in America and not the disaster of ratings that the adult swim claims to be on the cartoon network. I frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact that people now prefer to buy DVDs are watching the uncut episodes on the internet. This movie, however, probably did not have as many cuts and the voice work was good for a dubbed movie, although I prefer to watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some annoying voices for children in anything called. This movie features a boy who embarks on a train called Galaxy Express, hoping he can reach a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot that hunts humans for fun. During the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train, as well as a woman who resembles his late mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who like most women in Anime movies has a secret that can be really good for our young hero, or really bad. He goes from planet to planet as well while the train makes several stops and he runs to a space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his own cartoon series, so basically Galaxy Express happens in that universe. All in all a very good tour with a rather strange and unexpected ending. There would be a sequel to this one, but it was not as good as this one, however, the ending was a bit more final than it was here.
