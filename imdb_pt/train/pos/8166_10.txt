This movie is very good! The acting is good, with Corbin Bernsen's excellent cast as the perfectionist dentist who drives and tortures his patients. At first, he sees his wife with the pool man and then goes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and poolman, alongside the patients he tortures. The more special effects are also beautiful, though some are actually fake (like a perforated tongue that has been put on for a night out and is still red in the morning). But the torture scenes are absolutely well done. Although this film has the weak point, it is very slow; between the heavy parts, sometimes they are just extremely boring pieces. But for the real terror / thriller-fan, this is a must-watch!
