This wonderful film has all the elements that made Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few ... if not the only composer working on the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very cruel to the day!), and beautiful scenery and scenery (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). He also has a very good story, with a beautiful tragic romance. The actors do wonderful work - with truly remarkable performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a woman in a Western Spaghetti .. out of Cardinale in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West"). Without posting any spoilers, let me tell you that this movie contains one of the best finals of any movie I've ever seen!
