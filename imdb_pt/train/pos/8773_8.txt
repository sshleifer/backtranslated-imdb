Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, known as the man who beat John L. Sullivan. Directed with a light hand by Flynn's good friend Raoul Walsh, the film also features Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale, William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious and selfish young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive San Francisco Olympic Club in the late 19th century. Despite being humorous, being a "favela Irish" and a social climber builds resentment in the members of the Olympic Club; most of them can not wait to see him lose a fight, and they bet against him. Despite this, he comes to fame, even working as an actor. Finally he has the chance he's hoping for, a game with world champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan demands a $ 10,000 deposit to make sure Corbett shows up to fight for the $ 25,000 purse. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) are desperate to get the money. However, the help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie, and Jim Corbett is an excellent role for Flynn, who was a professional fighter at one go. It has the necessary charm, good looks and athletic ability for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, her romantic interest, who insists she hates him. In real life, it does not seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career rather than on boxing history. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is regarded as the man who made boxing an art form. In the film, Corbett is fleet of feet and avoids being hit by his opponents; It is believed that he used John L. Sullivan in this manner. <br /> <br /> Good movie to catch Flynn at the height of his time too short as a superstar.
