A lonely French boy depressed Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the beautiful Stephane Rideau). Silent and slow, this is a very frustrating film. On the one hand, I was absorbed in it and really felt for the two boys. On the other hand I was getting annoyed - the movie constantly blinks from the past to the present for no reason or reason. It is very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> There are also tons of holes in the plot - Mathieu, at one point, does something that puts him in the hospital. What is it - they never tell us! So he ends up with Cedric and tells everyone he's living with him. Because? We are not informed. Then it connects inexplicably with another guy at the end. Because? Without explanation. Of course Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu is living in the same town, so ... However, it's a tribute to the movie that you really care so much about the characters. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim like Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a beautiful body - but he can not act. Her idea of ​​acting is to sit with an empty look on her face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is very handsome, has a really cool body and is a great actor. He also has incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is full male nudity, lots of kissing, and a very explicit sex scene in the movie, which is great - most movies avoid showing male love scenes. It does not work and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating movie, but somehow worth seeing - especially for the nude scenes of Rideau - that is, if you like beautiful nude youngsters! <br /> <br />
