A young lawyer sent to a remote area to terminate the property of a recently deceased client. When he arrives, he discovers that he is less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not appreciated. To speed things up, he decides to move from the local inn and set up residence in his house, a house that is usually nebulized and is only approached by a sea-blocked driveway most of the day. Once there, he sees visions of a woman in black, she is real or imaginary, he is also subjected to the blood cries of a woamn and child seemingly drowning in the marshes, these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes terrified. Atmospheric television adaptation of a famous play by Susan Hill, who spends the first third of her characters, before moving to the creepy country house, her color contrast gives her TV roots straight away, this should be in black and white, but still as a ghost story, had some disturbing moments, although, after waiting so long to see it, I must say that, sadly, I was a bit disappointed.
