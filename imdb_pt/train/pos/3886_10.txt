Eddie Izzard is great with his uninterrupted humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (like the Heimlich Maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think. I do not know when I laughed so much in anyone's mind.
