Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare movies that is completely off the radar, but totally worth it. It really reminds me of the old sitcoms of the 1930s and '40s. That's why I'd love to see follow-up films ... but judging by the rest of the Full Moon production there simply were not enough breasts to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene, there are too many for the family audience - which is unfortunate, because without them this might have been a Harry Potter-style magic festival that children would have eaten. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I was not sure if Mrs. Nipar had not left a list A photo for this movie, she was very convincing. Not serious! Anyway - it's a shame they do not have the money to license Dr. Strange because I think this could have been a childish phenomenon.
