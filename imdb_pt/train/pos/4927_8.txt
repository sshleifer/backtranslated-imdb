Just one comment about the New Orleans accents ... A previous reviewer noted the following: "This movie could have been filmed in New York or another big northern town because it features characters who speak more like "broklynese" than perhaps a southern accent that can be heard in that part of the country. " There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans, in fact, sound "broklynese." I never figured out why. (It is mentioned in "The Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole.) I always appreciate the movies that happen in New Orleans that include this detail, as this one did. Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the southern standard accent.
