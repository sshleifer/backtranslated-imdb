This could be the most underrated film of the genre. I do not remember seeing ads or commercials for this movie, which could be the reason why it did not go so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror film. I rank him among the 10 most favorite horror films on my list. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with snapshots of pictures and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself "God's hand." And then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them go out together to go to a place where the victims are buried, which can help solve the case. During this journey, the man begins telling his brother's story and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father who one day claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons who appear to be regular humans. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his children to help him accomplish this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful movie that will keep you on the brink of your place. The tension increases, innocent people (or demons?) Are dead and religious experiences are questioned. It does not have one, but some very smart twists in the end. If you like this genre, I recommend Frailty to you. I own the DVD and it's one of my favorite horror thrillers.
