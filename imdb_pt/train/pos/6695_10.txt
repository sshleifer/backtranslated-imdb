Oh my God I live in Kentucky and when Mellisa Joan Hart came to Louisville she went straight through my neighborhood and waved to me I'm filthy rich so she wanted to look at my neighborhood oh and I love being rich anyway that she came to the Derby back to my interest in the show ...... this show makes you want to point the finger at something and make it disappear, I mean it's so creative and I love it, I'd love to be in that show ... ... this show is simply amazing, I want to say who has already come with this show I just want to give them a big kiss I mean it makes me feel better when I'm sick and it makes me happy when I'm angry I mean if someone tells me they do not like it, I'll tell them something. OK
