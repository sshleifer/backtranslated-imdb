I really can not condemn the movie because it works. There are enough film noir elements to consider it a noir film, but I think it's just in the category. <br /> <br /> There's nothing sinister about this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail. Of course, the disease can be considered sinister, but I have difficulty seeing it. The film suggests a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking human beings, New Orleans police are very willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all the people in the film ... but these are really just the same, There is no attempt to question Reed's motives, such as Marlowe's or Spade's, nor is there any attempt to bring a human side to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was really thrown away. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what fails the film in the end. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and directing are well done ... but there is nothing to make a movie that you should repeat again. Worth watching once, maybe twice, if you do not remember years ago, and then save.
