Ah, the 1970s A time when I was about to be a group. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a group, but it seemed more daring at the time. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a good soft-core movie. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what you would expect from a swinger movie. Two couples with open relationships rekindle the MILF's desire to travel from one of the women who came for a visit. Not much more than that. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles, it's a different story. Not many in their early 40s look as deliciously naked as Mrs. Welles. It's worth the price alone to see Mrs. Welles looking in the mirror as if she were Aphrodite. She is not "Stifler's mother". She's sexier. <br /> <br /> I also dug Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks and looks so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she could be her "unbundled twin" or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating, but must have an incredible metabolism. Unlike soft-core pornography of the 1990s, soft pornography of the 1970s kept the realism of hardcore film (something the 2000 soft-core brought back sometimes instead of the 1990s ). music and canned orgasms) and it is here with full force. It is not real, but it seems real. <br /> <br /> For those who have enjoyed the Quebec produced "Deux Femmes En Or", you will appreciate this. Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 per month you can spend.
