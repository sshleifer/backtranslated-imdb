I remember seeing this as a child in the United Kingdom, hypnotized by the story and the narration by Laurence Olivier. We would not talk about school any more the next day. I imagine the ratings for the first show were huge. This is simply the best comprehensive documentary series, despite the fact that they had to cut the story to the bone that they managed to capture so much. What is interesting is that the battles of Britain and North Africa were crucial, though not widely recognized by the Americans. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, the ill-treatment of Japanese prisoners of war by American troops. The images of the Holocaust made me, a non-Jewish European, feel guilty about the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one in the IMDb ranking. Maybe they're showing their prejudice against documentaries. Spoiler - we won.
