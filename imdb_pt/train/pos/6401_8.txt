Men of Honor has many grandiose aspects to it. Good action sequences, lots of "feel good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the film is the great acting. Especially by Robert Deniro. Men of Honor's story is focused on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African-American deep-sea diver in the Navy. He recounts his harsh struggle to be a poor farmer to enter diving school and more. It's a good story, but it seems like it's been done many times. A person, against all odds, will not give up until he reaches his goals that they set for some sentimental motive many years ago. This may happen, but many of the struggles that Brashear faces in the film are questionable, including CO. of the dive school by tampering with its final test. However, all this is done for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday, who is the teacher at the dive school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro enters, he omits this vibration of extreme arrogance that you can not hate, unless you have a wonderful force. Before the end of the film, Deniro makes several speeches that would make him laugh at how nice he is, but you're very stunned by the way he punishes you. In the end, you should doubt some aspects of the movie, but admit, if it were all true, you would have to doze in its place in the first twenty minutes.
