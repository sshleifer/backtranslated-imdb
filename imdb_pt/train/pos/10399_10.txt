This was a favorite of my childhood - I remember watching it on television and exciting every time. Now that I'm grown up and have a child of mine, I wanted to introduce you to this classic movie. We watched last Friday and he liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crawled and took mine - he was genuinely scared. "Is he going to beat the spider, Daddy?" Just watch, you'll see. He does not have a historical frame of reference to speak (eight years), so Baghdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid could very well be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he especially liked how much heroism and disobedience were perpetrated by the boy-thief and not by the adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct the film narrative a bit, the king is the thief's helper, not the hero - which should be very satisfying to imaginative and adventurous young people. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a part of the period - I suspect that when he's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'tacky' or whatever word the next generation will use up there. The love story is only one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the narrative demands it." Abu's willingness to be put at risk (repeatedly) by the deprived king of love and without love is equally improbable. But to discuss such things, accepting flying mechanical horses, the fifteen-foot geniuses and the All-Seeing Eye Temple would be stupid in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the climax of the movie is tremendous, just like the last shot of Abu triumphantly flying on his (stolen) magic carpet, seeking "some fun and adventure, finally!"
