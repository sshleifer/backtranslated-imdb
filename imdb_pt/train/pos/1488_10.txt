This is the only movie to see if you are married or a couple. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with issues as difficult as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" we are experiencing today in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. A must see. I hope it's distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and a 10-star rating from me!
