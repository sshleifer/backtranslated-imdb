I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite annoying. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times (as I did with the 1971 version) than for me, it's not so good. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I was only nine years old by the time the 1971 version was released. However, I have seen many remakes, in which I liked the original and the old. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and basically remained true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more excitement and was not so "blas√©."
