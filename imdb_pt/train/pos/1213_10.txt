This film contradicts the first with regard to the origins of Affectionate Bears and Affectionate Bears. I will not deny it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie, then it is a very good movie. I remember watching it in the early 80's (and fitting it into its demographic target audience at the time), and absolutely loving it a lot more than the first movie (not that I did not like it too, a little extra for that). Of course it's darker than the first too, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it's dark in a more subtle way too (which children may not fully understand, but may still be a little scared because of the atmosphere they emit, and watching adults will certainly get faster, now seeing that movie again now in my early twenties) where you basically have a girl making a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But simply observing this as a child, for sure, as I said, may have been a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. In fact, if something gave me another fantasy game, I could play when I was that age. I can not tell you the number of times I used to pretend that the Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, to make me help him catch the Loving Bears, I tried to turn to his dark side, and so on and so on. film was also good for my imagination. And it also has great emotional depth for that as well. I used to watch it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Hadley Kay was also the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I always thought so and I always will). <br /> <br /> Now it's too bad that they've never made a soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing Up without watching the movie, as good as it is. <br /> <br /> "What's the point of loving and caring if you can not save her?"
