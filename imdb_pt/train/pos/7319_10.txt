Halloween is the story of a boy who was misinterpreted as a child. He takes his troubles to his older sister, whom he kills at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things to come from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who has studied Myers for years. He knows something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and can not be stopped. <br /> <br /> After an escape from an institution, Myers traces his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have trouble finishing his sister while other people get in the way. He can get them off while still looking for that girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teens getting ripped apart by a masked or horrifying killer. But it all began, more or less. If you think about it, most of the horror movies that we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing scantily clad girls. Well, if it was not for Halloween, these characters would not have haunted our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloween director John Carpenter got a lot of the horror movies of the 1950s and combined everything he knew in a movie that scared many people in the late 1970s. These films solidified him as director to watch and also began the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being chased by the masked killer. <br /> <br /> This movie may sound clich√© today, but back there was not much out there like that. It was copied and stolen, but Halloween will always be the teen horror movie par excellence. It still gives shivers listening to Carpenter's gripping music as we watch another victim being chased by that somber Michael Myers.
