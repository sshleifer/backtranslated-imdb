I was first introduced to "Eddie" by friends from "all over the lake" who know I like clever humor. I prefer comedians who can be thought of at the same time entertaining, like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress to Kill' Eddie provides the same kind of social observation humor that spurs his thoughts on a subject all the time, causing his side to split at the same time. There are a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece on how to decide on the stage name of Englebert will leave you in points! <br /> <br /> Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
