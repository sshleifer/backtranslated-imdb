Although I'm not the biggest fan of wirework-based martial arts movies, when a movie goes straight to fantasy instead of fighting, I have a lot more fun with it and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic plot and flight Crazy. pranks Ching Siu Tung created here a charming treat with excellent performance and a lot of ethereal beauty. The great and tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and engages with an astonishing fox spirit and a crazy Taoist. Cheungs's performance is full of naive but dignified charm, and Wu Ma is pleasantly mad as the Taoist monk, who displays a few pieces of fencing and even receives a musical number. Perhaps best of all be Joey Wang as the spirit of the fox, truly a delight to contemplate every movement and gesture incredibly seductive. The film takes on elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all mixed together in a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and dealing with the choreography, gives some good vibes and fills the film with haunting mists, shadows and forest colors, giving each forest scene a wonderfully fascinating atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hairstyles and beautiful flowing clothes of the female characters, with, if I am not mistaken, Joey Wang wearing his hair like fox ears at times, a wonderful touch. Although the film has relatively little action and some cheesy pop music, sometimes ill-advised, it is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with incredible characters and plots, even an arc of characters, a nearly constant supply of visual delights and copious dreamy atmosphere. . An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
