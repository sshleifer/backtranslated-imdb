`Bruce Almighty 'will sweep the Oscar with a record of 14 Oscar wins! It will outperform "Titanic" as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's splendor will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential nomination for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These fantasies of greatness would only happen if the filmmakers (including Carrey) possessed the powers of God. That same premise is the primary ingredient in Carrey's new riot of laughter, "Bruce Almighty." Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main anchor that he holds God to total guilt over his own setbacks. God, heavenly interpreted by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the "Gift of God" (his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Obviously, Bruce is "carreyed" away with his new happy colleges and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back to his usual comedian form in "Bruce Almighty." Jennifer Aniston was not "mis.pittiful" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my first praise goes to director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog leave the house for # 2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty 'is not Carrey's deepest movie, but it's still a display of all-powerful carreyism! **** Good
