The only missing part in this movie is the part of Shue as the daughter who wants to follow in the footsteps of her "aunt" as a daytime soap star. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems like every actor liked their parts and exaggerated to fulfill their own pleasure as well as the script - I have to wonder if a little publicity was not occurring in parts. It was well launched and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie that everyone should see at least once. I would recommend not drinking anything that would hurt your nose. <br /> <br /> You'll definitely want to watch the last scene up close, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you. <br /> <br /> If you love daytime soap operas or despise them, this movement makes fun of all the right places.
