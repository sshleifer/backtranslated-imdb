Then Mary and Rhoda got old - who does not? I was a teenager when Mary debuted, and a "young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, the film may not have supported the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the series to make it an appropriate homage. Example: the producer who hires Maria and then dictates the idea of ​​a new series on "old people". Is not this typical of the mentality of the current Hollywood TV and Hollywood movie counters? This may not be the best of MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW - but it's a great look at one of the best shows we grew up with in the '70s.
