This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo police officer sent to Detroit to retrieve a prototype stolen from a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a car company that was being operated by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him, the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and got the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue his partnership. Meanwhile, in the same garbage dump where the Japanese man had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend was guarding the garbage dump. <br /> <br /> Tony departs to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is in assault while obviously homicide must investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime, he runs to the Japanese police and erroneously arrests him. Eventually they end up working together on the case. They make a weird pair and there are some really fun parts as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita jumping and kicking straight through the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it turns out to be a nice friend thriller, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is nice on paper and Pat Morita is good too. Still, they make for one of the most unlikely cop duos in an action movie. If you liked police movies, fancy movies from the 80's or if you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I highly recommend this movie.
