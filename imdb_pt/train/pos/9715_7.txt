Here's the skinny one, looks like this is a lot older than I thought it was. But it's still cool. The mechanics on the bike are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character problems that I hope will be resolved in Part 2 and my biggest complaint of everything that seems to be a withdrawal from MACROSS. Not just the animation style, but several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY from MACROSS. Mechs are similar to MACROSS and the other characters. This is not really done for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. Then, to shorten the story, I would give to these 7 MACROSS STARS.
