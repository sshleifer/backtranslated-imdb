"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The 90s opened with a clever Disney favorite, "TaleSpin," the TV cartoon series featuring characters from "The Jungle Book." Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they pilot the Sea Duck as you've never seen it before: leaving Cape Suzette, up the mountains of Louie, through the jungles, in the water, on volcanoes, looking for adventure, looking for treasures, looking for Fun, all in an adventure full of caricature action !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was a favorite of mine as well as my family. This happened at The Disney Afternoon throughout the first half of the 1990s, until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before buying a cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: today the DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, Dun, Dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
