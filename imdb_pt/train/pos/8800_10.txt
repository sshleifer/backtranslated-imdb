First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film so anti-American. Of course, there are times when the US is accused directly, as in the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on actual and documented facts, and all the documents the CIA has issued about Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie itself, what I liked the most about it is the variety of moods we find in it. We found children being educated by the respect of all the people who died in the event; we find an unhappy couple who will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their feelings downcast in the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to it with dignity or frustration; until we found someone in the movie for whom the fall of the towers landed for a moment of true happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and aid. the viewer got a glimpse of how different people around the world reacted to the events of September 11. So what we see is a much more complex picture than whites and blacks, and this can make some people angry; but this is the world we live in, and there is no place for Manichaean ideologies, no matter what presidents or priests may tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I find it a shame that there is not. until a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most Americans are asking why this catastrophe happened, and this movie could give some clues to them. This film puts it very clearly - unlike some people on this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the mistakes of the past will affect the way we live today.
