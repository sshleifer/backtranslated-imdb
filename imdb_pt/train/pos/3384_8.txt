My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compare with today's brainless film (just action and special effects and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" ask for something that no longer exists: Think. <br /> <br /> Well, it would not be a big surprise for a human day to eat "cookies" that are created with human body. With everything that happens on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to everyone, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Of course this movie has some age, but the idea behind the movie is real again. Rich in Paradise, another in hell. Well, lucky today they are TV and idiocy like "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is a good brain washing. It's a shame to see that human intelligence does not progress as technologies. Since writing everything stops. <br /> <br /> If you like reality show this movie is not for you. If you believe in all the politicians too. If you do not like to ask yourself about now and the future, never look at this movie.
