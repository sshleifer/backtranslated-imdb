The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are very few movies, in my opinion, that are perfect. This little photo B is a tense story, well told. I've always been intrigued by Alexander Knox, but I've seen him very few movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without a shred of remorse. Performance is one of the most chilling performances I have ever seen. Since World War II, actors who played Nazi or other evil types in movies were occasionally nominated for the Oscars. I imagine that since this was done during the war, the Academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil. But Knox does this kind of performance - a man so bitter and consumed with guilt that he does not think about making others suffer. I still can not get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the social butterfly or philander, is chosen against the probably the best performing type I've ever seen, either. Maybe not worthy Oscar, but the best of his career. Nothing against it; I liked her in those "light" roles she often played. But here she proves that she is up to the heaviest drama. <br /> <br /> If you like stories of human drama, or stories about the fate of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend film.
