This is so to say a sequel to the animated batman and is very good as he and for all the same reasons that has lots of action in that the plot for this is good the voice over the actors are very good, like Kevin Conroy as batman, Mark Hamil as the Joker, etc. The villains are really good, like the Joker, Two Faces, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So, I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman, because it's very good. So, make sure that you watch on TV or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********* out of orgasm **** <br /> <br /> **** out of *****
