I think many people have just written this as another of Tom Cruise's (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) weird movies, but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was strange; it was not. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is the Truman show. Confusing is the matrix or the game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - perhaps not immediately, perhaps not today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confused because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That is the question. This is where the so-called "strangeness" that has transformed the critics comes in. If they had bothered to "open their eyes" like the original 1997 movie, they would have seen it. And if that's not reason enough to see it, go see it for the song. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to define "sensation" - that notorious element that many movies do not have. With songs like "Good Vibrations," by The Beach Boys, playing the film's dramatic and emotional climax, it creates an eccentric, yet surprisingly "right" sensation. A wonderful film, in its script, music, acting and images, Vanilla Sky is, unfortunately, a superficial film that the critics reprimand to appear intelligent. Excellent: A +
