In addition to the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this movie is actually better than the book (and the TV miniseries, although this is an easy task, considering the director). The flawless filming style, acting and (the number one skill of Kubrick's time) music - make it the masterpiece of terror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and I enjoyed the story and I had my hopes on it when I got it. He surprised me !!! It is much better than I imagined. It starts slow (Kubrick's trademark) and has plenty of downtime accumulating suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere that induces the whole movie. Also the film does not offer much gore (it has just enough and is by no means tasteless) a trend I hate in the horror movies of the past few days. See you!
