This was a very thought-provoking film, especially for 1973. At the time, it was really a huge blockbuster. After the 1970s, it seemed oblivious, but its core messages were too important to disappear altogether. In fact, it was at least fifteen years ahead of his time ... no one had ever heard of the "greenhouse effect" before 1985, and the controversial topic of euthanasia was rarely raised. <br /> <br /> Scenarios and special effects may seem a bit outdated, but a lot of money for science fiction films was a gamble at that time. If you look closely you will see that everything usually makes sense. This is a message movie, not for star wars fans who can not handle a minute of thought-pacing unless it contains a million dollars in explosions. <br /> <br /> This was also Heston's last good movie, the end of his famous dystopian science fiction trilogy. After this everything was exaggerated disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing rubbish. This may not be the funniest two-hour movie of all time, and the ending can be scary and depressing, but it's hard to find any movie producer with the courage to deal with a subject like that.
