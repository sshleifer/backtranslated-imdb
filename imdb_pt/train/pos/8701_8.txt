For all who expect a traditional movie of superheroes, it can be a nasty surprise. It's definitely more of a drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character, it always goes awry in some way. <br /> <br /> That's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into her own hands and society does not like it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. While running, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the film has no dynamics. This reminds me a bit of the narration in the recent films of Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it is so immensely dynamic that before you realize what is happening, it is over. But the director does not want to impress us with a showy and flashy action. What is most important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The punctuation is very scarce, which also makes it difficult to focus on the film. So basically you need to be very patient to watch it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? This is a really difficult question to answer. I do not think this experience made me very rich, but somehow I keep thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. Mainly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all, they are young, they have a lifetime to live. So, no matter how difficult it is, there is always a slight joyful melody when they are together.
