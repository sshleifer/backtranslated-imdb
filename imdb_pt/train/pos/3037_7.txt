The film "MacArthur" begins and ends with general Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck and Alma Mata, at the West Point Military Academy in Hudson. We see a fragile 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur give the graduation speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor to serve his country. The film enters a nearly two-hour flashback in the brilliant and controversial career of General MacArthur, which begins in the early hours of World War II on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942. <br /> < said he would leave the island for Australia before the Japanese military invaded it. General MacArthur for the first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he will be abandoning his men in their greatest hour of need, MacArthur reluctantly, along with his wife and son, did as he was told only to haunt him for the memory of the war. That was the reason, his escape under the fire of death or captivity by the Japanese, which led General MacArthur to use all his influence to obtain FDR two years later to launch a great invasion of the Philippians, instead of the island of Formosa, to I endorse his promise to both the Filipino people and the thousands of US prisoners of war behind them. That he will return and return with the power of the US Army and Navy to support his promise! In the two years until the invasion of the Philippine archipelago, MacArther attacked the Japanese forces of the South Pafific in a series of brilliantly designed island-island battles that isolated and deprived hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers to to surrender. The General did this by suffering far less US military losses than any other allied commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> It was in 1950/51, in the Korean War, that General MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory, as did his worst military defeat. After flanking the advance of the North Korean Army in the brilliant and perfectly executed, with the invasion of the US Marines suffering less than 100 casualties, invasion of the door or left hook of General Inchon MacArther feeling invincible sent US forces / UN under his command to the border, along the Yalu River, of Communist Red China. They told his subordinates that he is facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Chinese Communist troops that General MacArthur pressed in any way until the attack materialized, cutting off US and UN forces. The uncontrollable wave of attacking the Red Chinese troops forced US / UN forces to retreat into the 1950s Big Bug Out with their own lives, leaving all their equipment behind, crossing the North Korean border and abandoning the southern capital of Seoul! This has become one of the biggest military disasters in US history, with US forces losing a record in the Korean War of 1,000 lives on the first day of November. 29/30 1950 - From the Chinese Communist Invasion! <br /> <br /> Shocked and humbled at what he allowed, mainly due to his own arrogance, happened MacArthur was on the offensive not against the Communist advance Chinese and North Korean forces, but his own commander and chief Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, for not having the courage to do what has to be done: Launch a complete invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons, if necessary, to prevent its troops from invading the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who had taken enough of General MacArthur's garbage in his mouth in public, how he was running the war improperly, how MacArthur wanted him to be the last drop! On April 11, 1951, Pres. Truman unceremoniously revived General MacArthur of his command as Supreme Commander of the United States / UN forces in Korea! Pres. Truman's courageous but very unpopular decision, by not following MacArthur's overall war strategy, prevented World War III from allying itself with the ally of the Soviet Union-Communist China-which at the time - like the United States - had the atomic bomb! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to dismiss the all-too-popular General MacArthur also cost him re-election in 1952, with such a low number of polls - in the mid-1920s - that he withdrew - in March of that year - from the US presidential campaign. General MacArthur's disgrace was when the political and military climates of the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality would have been national suicide, as General MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese, possibly causing a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only USSR & Red China, but the whole world! It was this important reality of the future war that Gen. MacArthur was never taught, since the A and H bombs had not yet been invented at West Point. Back in 1962, we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after completing his graduation speech at West Point, became an elder and wiser soldier, as well, ever since his retirement from the American military statesman , in her feeling about war and her total futility. One thing that Gen. MacArthur was taught early on by his father Douglas McArthur, who was imprisoned throughout his life, was that for a soldier like him the war should be the last and not the first resort to settle . between nations. In what are the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for General MacArthur to finally realize just how wise and wise his father, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, as he really was!
