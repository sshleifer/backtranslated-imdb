I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel. The young man returned from service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic leadership as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives him as if he were hungry to see her, as well as for his hesitation and confusion, as well as his feelings for him were very well interpreted. The rest of the quirky characters in the store were perfect as they tried to get them together. The most moving scene, however, was the young couple at their great-grandfather's house. I laughed at parts, I cried at some and I really enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I re-watched five times. A definite must see for total romantics.
