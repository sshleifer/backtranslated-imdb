Nobody better spoil this piece of work! Incredible movie! Written expertly by the likes of Ira Levin and portrayed with the best performance of the career of Christopher Reeve and one of the best of Caine, this is simply excellent. I wish I could get a version staged somewhere ... maybe one day I will. I hope this grossly underestimated and neglected film has not become too difficult to locate because it is a "must" for any Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile or lover of a great movie. One of the very few movies that I could not solve or preview instantly and deserve a second or even third preview, "Deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and earns every penny of it. We need and deserve more movies like this!
