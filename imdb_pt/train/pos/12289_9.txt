First of all, I would like to point out that I did not read the book, so I did not stand a chance of being disappointed by this aspect. The major flaw I saw was the historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I do not think they belong at that moment. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the film is ok, nothing to brag about. But the acting, I think, was great. I have no experience in acting, yet I can not believe how people can consider it terrible! Maybe they have only seen two movies (never), and the other must have been really good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and I really understood his personality, someone who went up the social ladder with a lot of hard work, so he fights those who take the work of his life from him, only he gets so involved in this fight, he does not realize that reason is no longer by his side, and he ends up being a defeated and disappointed man. Irons made it so believable, I sympathized with the character, despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic girl, who is attracted to the revolutionary ideals of her boyfriend (Banderas, he had an underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, was not bad, just did not meet the standards of the other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, an excellent Portuguese actor, among so many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to today's films, here only the interpretations, only people matter, but at the same time, it is not a pretentious film, very worried trying to be intellectual. The best test I really enjoyed, I'm writing a review 7 years later.
