Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I love the 80's genre of this type of movie, because you do not see as many as that! I want to ask all the people who say that this movie is just an imbecile, or a corny imitation, what is imitation? I've never seen another movie like this, well, nor horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about the popular group at school that likes to make everyone live a hell, so they decided to choose that. nerdy boy named Marty. It happens fatal when he really hurts himself from one of his little jokes. <br /> <br /> So, it's like 10 years later, and the group of friends that hurt Marty starts getting the high school reunion letters. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! Then they go back to the old school, and one by one is knocked over ... Yes, you probably know what happens! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the end. It could have been left out, or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try, and try not to be critical! CupidGrl ~ * ~
