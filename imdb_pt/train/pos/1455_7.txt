Mardi Gras: Made in china is an excellent film that shows how two cultures have much in common but are not even aware of the influence that each society has on each other. David Redmon opens his eyes and lets you see how workers in China produce bills that cost little or nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon questions Americans about where those accounts come from, they had no idea and looked like donkeys. When he told them that they are made in China for less than anything with horrible wages and unacceptable working conditions, Americans looked sad, hurt, and a little remorseful, but they did not seem to really stop buying the bills after discovering the truth. . When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they did not know that the Americans wore them around their necks and paid so much for those bills. The workers laughed at what was the purpose behind the accounts and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in countries other than ours. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
