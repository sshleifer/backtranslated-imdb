If you are not in the mood for more than an hour of film than this movie could give you some variation. What I love are the continuous surprises. It's not just once that you want one or more short films from 'New York I Love You' to be continued. Yes, some of the short ones make you curious, some of them very short, some of them longer, some of them have definite ends, some of them not. <br /> <br /> Most of the story features the sad side of the capital. Shows many backgrounds of different nationalities. Many of them make it look the same as I once went to a capital in other countries for a year, where many people came from different countries. This movie explores many kinds of things you may have known, but for all the characters it is a new thing. Maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; Feel dreamy, sad, but the kind of sad you're looking for, because it's just that you were bored in your own home. You may want to relive it again by noting this.
