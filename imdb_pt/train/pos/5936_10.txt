I just saw ... for those who do not know what it is, I suggest downloading the entire feature and enjoy watching it ... it's an amateur trailer made with the same producer of the famous short Batman Dead End, but this time in addition to the black knight, there is also Superman ... It would be wonderful if they made the whole movie ... but I fear it is almost impossible, especially shortly before the official Batman 5 movie. - There is no greater crime against peace than refusing to fight for it. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo 'Purifier'Pinto
