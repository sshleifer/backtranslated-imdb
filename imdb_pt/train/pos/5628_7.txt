Having reviewed some of the other reviews here, I have a major complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful "victim" and the handsome, obviously extremely "out of the center", blue-collar protagonist (albeit short) - beating each other like a Kabuki scenario in the Caucasus. Okay, and that, of course, is mostly a "turn the tables" story. <br /> <br /> However, my referenced complaint is that I believe the director was caught in his desire to display the obvious and known physical attributes of Farrah.Starting with her being attractively dressed in a thin robe, and with a number of scenes showing more than necessary for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eye, these distract from the level of pungency of the drama. <br /> <br /> Your roommates are sure to give performances as written and directed - however, their skepticism and their histrionic babbling and hiccups do not sound true - based on exp the obvious evidence that he had premises with only the worst intentions, and that she had absolutely no reason to exaggerate what had happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a film and a story, appealing both in spite of and because of, the director's work.
