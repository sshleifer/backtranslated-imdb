Being a transplanted New Yorker, I may be more critical than most in attending the prefecture. But I have to say that before I even got into the story itself, I was fascinated by the location footage and the New York political atmosphere that director Harold Becker created. For example, there is a reference to Woerner's Restaurant. in Brooklyn, where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There was or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York in 1996. In fact, he was particularly favored by political people in the Borough, although they had other places. <br /> <It is not surprising that the script was co-written by Nicholas Pileggi, who still writes stories of organized crime and politics. He knows the atmosphere well and knows for sure how these two worlds intersect, as they do in this movie. <br /> <br /> A detective played by Nestor Serrano makes an unofficial meeting with a relative of mafia boss Anthony Franciosa, and things happen and three people die, including an innocent 6-year-old boy whose father took him to the school. The story grows and in the end is achieved within the city hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his deputy mayor, a transplanted Louisianan, a state that has a tradition of corruption. He is the stranger here and attempting to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he expected, <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those who are not from New York , his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes, who was also overthrown by the scandal. He is much more the kind of Brooklyn politician I met at the time, whose friendship with organized crime and favors made by them, makes Aiello. <br /> <br /> The city hall was the farewell performance in Anthony Franciosa's film, one of the most underrated and underrated talents of all time on the screen. No one watches anyone else when he wants. <br /> <br /> The best moment of Al Pacino is when at the funeral of the dead child, he takes the process and turns it into a political triumph for himself. His part is complex, he's a decent enough man, but he gets involved in the corruption necessary to rise up in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, City Hall is highly recommended.
