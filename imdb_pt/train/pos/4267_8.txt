During a celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, where do we go here? was finally discovered by a screening. It's incredible that a film of any era that has Weill-Gershwin's collaborations may be missing on the screen. The score is high, and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only underscores its merits, which are considerable. Yes, the movie has its problems, but the scoreboard is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not quite understand the material. So too, the "modern" segment is poorly written. BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark, as well as the work of the two delightful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this type of work desperately needs to work. As a World War II salute to the history of our country - although in a 'never gone' frame, the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available for everyone to see and find their considerable merits.
