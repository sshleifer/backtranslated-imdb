I only have one Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond, the decent Agent Under Fire, and the dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I planned was Everything or Nothing, because my friend told me it was better than the two games I already had. I have to say, he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for ten dollars in HMV, and when I got home, I hit my Cube and played for hours on end. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. The graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 is out, the Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The plot was clever; the crazy man (Willem Dafoe, nominated as Nikolai Diavolo) and the handsome henchman (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with little nanobots, who, at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, have to destroy a train. The bad news is that one of them is hidden in Katya's breasts. You then have to thwart your plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this game is that it actually has actors expressing the characters, such as Cleese giving voice to Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them very long and complicated. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90%
