* Contains spoilers because I have to describe some movie techniques, so read at your own risk! * I loved this movie. The use of dyeing in some scenes makes it appear that an old photograph comes to life. I also enjoyed projecting people on a background screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him instead of on a typical split screen. His face is huge in the back and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when the boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene filmed in an almost political poster style. , with facial closes. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense and constant style along with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much blood. Even with the scene when Katharina finds her dead father in the bathtub ... you can only see the red water on the side. It's one of the things I love about Von Trier, his horror euphemism, which ends up making it all the more scary. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was unique, as when the character of Leo is pushed by the word "werewolf." I've never seen anything like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. Bring the giggles I received from your role in the Kingdom (Riget). This humor makes the plot of the absurd anal retentivity of the train drivers against the terrible scenery of World War II and all the chaos easier to take. This reminds me of Riget's way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain normalcy at the end of the first part, when everything is going crazy. This shows that some people are truly oblivious to the terrible things happening around them. However, some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but they do not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> The narration, well done by Max von Sydow, is fun too. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a scary place to be. <br /> <br /> The film brings out that someone is a coward if they do not choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character does not speak for itself and ends up being his own destruction. In fact, once, Von Trier looked anti-woman to me, doing Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his male characters do not do well either! I found myself in the same place during the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink your actions, but of course they never do!
