I just saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it very good. This was the first appearance of George Sanders as the Saint, where he replaces Louis Hayward. In this, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a nightclub. With the help of their acquaintance, Inspector Fernack, who came from New York, they help a daughter of a crime boss. <br /> <br /> Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <It's not a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
