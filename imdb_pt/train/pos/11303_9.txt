Visconti's first film has all of his pristine visual and technical flair, accompanied by compelling performances by Massimo Girotti as the handsome tramp and, best of all, Clara Calamai as the fabulous and frenetic Giovanna. Remade several times as "The Postman Rings Twice", but never improved. I can not believe this was man's first movie! This shows the confidence of someone at the peak of their career.
