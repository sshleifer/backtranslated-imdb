If Dick Tracy were in black and white, the pope would not be religious. Giving a new meaning to the concept of color in a film, we are offered a unique experience throughout a comic book world, and it is one of the few films that have achieved, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances. (Al Pacino is amazing) and, most importantly, a powerful blend of cinematography, art direction and costumes. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before. And there is also a successful tribute to the whole genre of gangster films, virtually extinct in modern cinema. In general, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality for a cinema that depends more and more on the old formulas already seen. 7 out of 10.
