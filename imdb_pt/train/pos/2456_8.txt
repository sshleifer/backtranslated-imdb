When I went to watch this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought of watching a boring teenage movie, BUT in fact, the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was a little convincing - especially from Melville who really shows off his talent in this film, and the fight scenes were - for a low budget film - very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a wider audience than what it received. It's a movie that can be seen by the whole family - it may not be the least of the children, as it contains some rather rough scenes. A movie about love and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very much like "Bend it like Beckham", but I think this movie is better.
