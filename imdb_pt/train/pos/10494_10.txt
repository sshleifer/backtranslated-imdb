Great view of a mature woman, who will lose everything (until the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved with this special "deal," the innocence and true love that exists among the people of a small town, is perfectly matched to give us a new, light and entertaining comedy. I could not stop laughing with a very funny scene of two ladies at a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European films, and with films like this, my opinion gets stronger. A film that I also recommend with closed eyes, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as I did. You will love.
