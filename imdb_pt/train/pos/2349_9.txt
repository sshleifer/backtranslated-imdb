It's a pleasure to see this creativity on TV again. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters relate well and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve when they get their legs). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> The girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable as is Olive. The two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope they write them in larger parts, since they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all the news you're ready to print. Go make a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun old fashioned. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
