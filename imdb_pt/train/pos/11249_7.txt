I just watched all 6 episodes on DVD. The acting is excellent - no doubt. There was not enough action for me, I must say. No real suspense as such, just too much development of first-class characters. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of whodunnit. If you like a good story slowly and carefully told, then this is for you. Peter Egan as leader Magnus Pym is excellent. <br /> <br /> The film portrayed the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so psychologically damaged by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things. As a child, he adored his father, but his father was exposed time and time again as a thug and crook. Pym betrayed not by ideology or money, but because he needed to fool those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally undermined by his father's influence - he devoured his moral fiber. He has no true love or loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological stuff and not many moments of light in the 6-hour series. Very well done though.
