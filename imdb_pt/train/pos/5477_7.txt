An original and uncensored copy of this incredible film was uncovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress and was exhibited in some specialized cinemas around the world in 2005. According to the current reviews I found online, the original has all the unpleasant and innuendo intact; Later they were removed or completely re-filmed by the studio before the initial release in order to pass the censors of the state of New York. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and can only be expected! If we are lucky, we will include comparisons between the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck Rules!
