I read the book for the first time as a teenager and watched the movie late at night. About a year ago I checked the IMDb and found that there were no copies available. Then I went to the web and found a website that offered War Films, so I was glad I did, I asked for a copy, I remembered and I could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion to really enjoy the movie, I suggest you read a copy of the book and watch the movie. The book is no longer in print, but I made a copy down via E-bay, author Alan White was a command / parachutist during World War 2 participating in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the authenticity of the book and movie. I did not give just ten to the movie because of the nature of the movie's ending, not as good as the book. There are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book as well, which is strange, as the book is not about the nature of large-scale warfare but about the individual at war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the movie to let him watch, in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can trace it in the book and in the movie then it is definitely worth it and I just wanted it to be more readily available for more read and see, one of my best war movies of all times!
