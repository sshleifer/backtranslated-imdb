Away from my second favorite drawing of Spielberg, after the Animaniacs. Even though the ratings were low, what, I still liked and loved, was so funny and I loved the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and they were just fantastic, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this drawing again, it was so incredible and the jokes were brilliant. I also remember the hilarious moment Brain appeared, you heard his voice and played the instrumental theme of PATB, which was just fantastic, I love it in cartoons when the cameos appear. I wanted this cartoon and Animaniacs to come back, I loved them
