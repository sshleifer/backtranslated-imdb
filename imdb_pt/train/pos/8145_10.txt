I saw this movie for the first time about 4 years ago and was expecting something funny, similar to CB4. I was impressed. I was on the ground laughing my butt in this movie is so great. Much better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. Top independent film that was given "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
