I've seen this movie more than once. He was privy to much of the scary material being shown in television movies at that time. The only problem I had was with the title for the obvious reasons ... One immediately thinks of the famous Drake snack cake! Leaving out the first part, 'Hound of Hell' would have sufficed. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna can always bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. But this was a nice Halloween fare offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him to conquer the evil beast. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna in terms of the taxi driver dissing the ethnic beliefs of his own people. 'Aw, Mr. Barry, I left these things behind when I came down from the mountains ...' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to actually contact him. <br /> <br /> As far as the supernatural passage is concerned, this film is still enjoyable.
