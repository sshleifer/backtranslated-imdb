This movie is very funny, a totally non-PC gangster joke. If Mel Brooks took a picture of Mob in the '30s, it would probably be like this. Many great one-liners to remember, and while it is not for everyone, someone who does not laugh a lot of times does not have a pulse. So put it on and laugh at you Iceholes !!!
