This is one of the favorite movies of all time. Parker Posey's character is exaggerated, and the librarian's motive will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked on the books and piles of the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, RENT THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is also highly recommended. I've shown this film to more friends in the library than anyone else - everyone falls in love with it.
