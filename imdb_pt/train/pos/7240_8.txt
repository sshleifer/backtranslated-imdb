When I found this movie in my local videostore I expected it to be another American vampire movie in the same vein as "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise "To Die for" is a very good film. It's a little bit Sometimes it's a bit cheesy, but there are still sceneries and surprises with enough style to satisfy the vampire enthusiasts. This is a perfect blend of romance and horror and, surprisingly, it's bloody. Highly recommended.
