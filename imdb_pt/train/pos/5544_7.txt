The People's Republic of China, which was the lowest of the casualties, really hit the gold with this little sultry thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with "Detour," which is probably one of the best low-budget movies of all time. "Strangler" is basically a movie, full of haze and shadows, a technique used by most poverty-line studios to hide sets, or the lack of them. But here it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) circulates through the swamp killing those involved in his mistaken execution for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer. His ultimate victim is to be the boatman's daughter ..... he focuses his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but also on his relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that goes through her acting style. She offers herself to the strangler to end the killing, but as a breath to the public, the strangler sees the goodness of his gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the future, somewhat punished. If Ulmer (who directed "Deviance") directed "Strangler", it would hang from the nearest tree and the throttle work would be done. But who is complaining? It is not the story that is the great attraction, but the scenarios, the lighting and the general bad mood of the play. Standing, just behind "Detour", as the best time of the PRC
