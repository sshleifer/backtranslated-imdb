The absolute summum of the work of the astute Dane Douglas Sirk (born Detlef Sierck), written in the wind, compels our lazy attention in all the gaudy pictures. From its famous opening sequence, with the leaves blowing in the baronial vestibule of a Texas mansion and the wind revolving the pages of the calendar in a flashback, the film compresses in 99 minutes all the familiar intrigue it would feed later, little imitations of screens like Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest throughout his years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme that Americans in our dollar-based society find irresistible. Brother and Sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled and disturbed heirs to the Hadly Oil fortune; Childhood friend Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are the healthy outsiders who try to keep the lid on the cauldron. (It is rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann's marriage to Reynolds' tobacco money.) As always, the misfit have the whole scenario to chew - and the best phrases to spit (Malone, in his acting as the nymphomaniac intoxicating with a jones to Hudson, begins to detonate an entire display of fireworks from them). Hudson, though good, can not compete with all this exaggerated eminence; Bacall begins strong, but grows recessive, a mere convenience of plot. Does not matter; with a succession of filmed footage in extravagant tones, Sirk gives an objective lesson on how to turn into an exaggerated melodrama set in the exuberant consumer paradise of America's late 50's. No one has ever done better.
