Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at her best, and for Maggie fans, it's great to see her in her early days, matching Ustinov every step of the way and timing. For the Englishmen in their fifties (and I'm on this track), it's always fun to see glimpses and hear the sounds of the 60s, and although this movie spends a lot of time in offices, it has a lot of nostalgia for the 60s, including red buses , Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delicious shot in the micro-skirt of a waitress, something that England has never seen in public places. As an I.T. engineer, I know that computer hacking tricks are laughable, but they should not be taken seriously. Neither are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French, and Germans.
