I saw the German version of the movie on German television and was really impressed. I usually enjoy watching documentaries, but I do not remember seeing one that is better than 'Terra'. I knew some of the scenes from the Youtube videos that I found by random browsing. I also remember seeing parts of the movie in multimedia stores, running on the high definition TVs displayed. After watching the movie, it's obvious to me why filming is so popular with YouTube users and multimedia retail managers: it's so incredible and spectacular that you can not help looking at the screen, it does not matter if you is interested in nature Documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation, 10 out of 10. Sure enough, there are more exciting films, but in relation to documentaries, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best of its kind.
