What another reviewer called a lack of character development, I call it an understatement. The film did not hit the head with an overexplication or an unnecessary background story. Yes, there were many untold stories that we only caught a glimpse of, but this was mostly a snapshot of a day at an event that catalyzed the change in all the lives of the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was a truly adorable study in acting power that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
