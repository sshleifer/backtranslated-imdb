After repeated auditions on the CD soundtrack, I knew I wanted this movie, I bought it for Christmas and was impressed. Marc Bolan had such charisma, I can not describe. I had heard of him that way, but I did not understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this footage. He was incredible. Clips from the Wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches, such as nuns swallowing themselves at a garden party as Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning the titles of the songs). George Claydon, the diminutive photographer of the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would ruin everything, even if I put the spoiler warning in this review, so you just need to see it for yourself. He evades description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious about Ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now, I finally figured out it's been on DVD for 2 years but it's finally in my house . It's an incredible viewing experience - even captivating. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden extras in the Born To Boogie DVD release. 1. On the disc menu one, select the bonus material and go to the extra scenes 2. On the extras scene page go to Scene 42 take 1 and continue pressing left 3. when the cursor disappears, continue pressing until a "Star + 1972" logo appears 4. Press Enter <br /> <br /> 5.In the main menu of disc two, select the sound options 6. On the sound options page go to 90/25 (I think that's right) option and continue pressing to the left 7. When the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a "Star + Home video" logo appears 8. Press Enter
