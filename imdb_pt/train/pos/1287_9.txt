"Let's Bowl" started on local television in the Twin Cities. Arrived late at night, something you stumbled while surfing the canal after your 7th bottle of Hamm's. Even the ads were produced locally, displaying Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stammering nervously. "Ahh ... for you, Steve Sedahl." I do not know why, but it always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition presented under the guise of resolving a dispute between two players, but the game was secondary to comments and clips. Sedahl went straight, counterbalanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt." Highlights included segments such as "How to properly dispose of an old bowling ball" and "Tips on Dating," where the pair "date" some prostitutes and Wally ends with the bitter complaint: "I could have done that alone! "<br /> <br /> Another segment - what the duo did on their days off - featured Steve in the beer can, kicking out of the refrigerator while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, dressed in his tight light blue blazer and big headphones. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> Wally's striking remarks about "league players," and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various divisions were also highlights. "Let's Bowl" was chosen by Comedy Central and had some good times, but the network never really knew what to do with it, performing it during prime time and emphasizing bowling "competition" , which was never the goal of the show. The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the secondary characters (Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and half-forced. Even Jon Stewart insulted Let's Bowl on the Daily Show - is not it enough, ridiculous jokes? - an ignominious treatment for a program that deserved much more. <br /> <br /> How often does "Let's bowl" come into the world of modern television, a local mix of comic genius and total crap? The nets have the "total crap" part in the cold, but it's a sad thing to see them kill a bizarre, funny and funny gem like "Let's Bowl." <br /> <br /> Here we expect them to be released on DVD.
