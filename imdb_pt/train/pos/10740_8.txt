Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon, this is an exciting and moving story of how the best of New York shone on its darkest day. I first saw this when I was a naive young man of 12 years, and at that age still touched me. Knowing just how serious the 9/11 really was seeing it expanded all the effect of September 11. We were discovering who the heroes were, how everyday lives were, and how they put their lives at risk in a situation where most people simply ran and saved themselves. These brave men put their lives at risk and seeing it increases my admiration for them. See if you can, this is the best documentary I've ever seen.
