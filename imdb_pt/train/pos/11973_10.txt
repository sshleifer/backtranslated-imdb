Full House is a wonderful sitcom that is about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. Then Danny asks his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis, and his best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help raise their three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show, and I can watch it all day. And something in Full House is always making me laugh and there are sad parts too. There's never a dull moment in Full House. The main characters are played by Bob Saget, John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen. ).
