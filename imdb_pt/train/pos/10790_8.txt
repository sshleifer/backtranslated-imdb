This incredibly stereotyped "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever seen in a TV movie. In addition, you can predict the result from the beginning. However, it's a fun movie that does the job: entertain. That's all it's been made to do and it happens. The acrobatics and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not at all bad. The acting is also decent, which is not a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you're definitely going to love it. If not, then do not waste your time. 8/10
