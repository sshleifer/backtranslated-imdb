I went to see him twice this movie, a friend of mine was watching him at the launch party, and he was telling me it was so good, I was expecting so much about the movie, I could not enjoy it because I was not watching in the nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt like throwing a party. I loved the song, it's great. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his talent as a director, he will be the director of whom everyone will be speaking. If you can delivere this movie as your first you should be talented. <br /> <br /> The acting is done by some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a lot of upcomming talents like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
