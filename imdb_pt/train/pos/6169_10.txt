The multi-layer romance of Rohinton Mistry seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and emotion. The story is a bit slow, but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. The film perfectly captures a specific time and place accurately. All the actors are Indians - few or all known to the "western" public - but they are a joy to see, especially the little girl who acts with great conviction. Do not get discouraged with the title and summary of the plot - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen. We have much to learn from this.
