I've seen this movie for some time, after asking my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The movie itself was very interesting, despite having its positives, which to me was Donnie Darko's type of "wtf?" factor after the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Of course, with positive, there are also negative points. For me, the young lady in the film was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job too. Unfortunately I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This may just be me, and I'm not claiming to be a serious critic, in the same way that I do not feel skilled enough, but he simply did not seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps it is even more impressive at the time, for although I am not a critic, it catches my attention. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I think it is definitely a movie worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you should have seen it.
