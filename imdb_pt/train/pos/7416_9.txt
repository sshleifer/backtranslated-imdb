This movie is moving without being sentimental - meaningful without being pretentious. He tells a simple story of a family in danger of collapsing as the invasions of technology and a society in advance make the family business increasingly unsustainable. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful - although none of us are likely to have heard the West of these actors, we should have done so long ago - they interpret their characters with honesty and reverence - these are defective characters, each one with great weaknesses, but with such humanity and gentleness that it's impossible not to get involved. We need more movies like this - we need more Western filmmakers creating films like that.
