I did not give this movie a perfect note to be honest compared to great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai". However, this movie is so wonderful, it's such a shame that it is so weak for the general elector of IMDb. However, the IMDb voter relies on the nerd, and "Paulie" does not qualify for it. <br /> <br /> The only criticism I can suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not portray the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but asking a 6 year old to do Dustin Hoffman as Rainman is asking for the impossible in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Passing through this minor complaint, the movie has the best of many movies: friend road-trip, con-games, hero as friendly party-animal (party-bird?), Disney-like humor for young and old, etc. What's not to like? Tony Shaloub uses his role as a pair of comfortable jeans. This is normal for him, it seems. ("I'm Russian ... I LIKE long stories.) I do not like sleeves, but it almost makes me want to go out and buy one." Watch the movie and it will make sense. Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin makes very appropriate appearances in the film, roles that are quite appropriate to what we all know about them.I always found Jay Mohr a bit slimy, and his screen role also fits in. The only surprise for me was finding out that Jay too was the voice of Paulie. In the end, even this works well, put Parrot and anti-Parrot together as a team and creates a spell of its own. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are trying to find a movie for you and children who are neither insulting nor boring to both, "Paulie" is a perfect candidate, but I admit that a happy moment colored my review of "Paulie." I was on a road trip during a major heat wave. car's conditioning died, half of the restaurants had dead mo made our hotel) and I said "let's watch a movie where there is air-cond itioning. "When we saw him recently on the VCR in less emotional circumstances, I realized how well this film was made. It's a movie you will not regret watching.
