I do not know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive homage to some Muslim religious action (hajj), but I felt that the film is so underrated. I simply can not believe the film has been voted by only 223 people so far, since the film was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since then. About the movie ... it's one of those well-represented candy. Reda, a French teenager who should be part of the Baccalauréat, is invited by his elderly father to take him to Mecca. Strange as it may seem (if one does not know much about Islam), the father wants his son to lead them. from his home in France to Saudi Arabia on a unique religious pilgrimage in life. The generation gap between father and son is based on fairly simple terms (you may know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life, "the unnamed father to your child), but some kind of bromidic generation The father never speaks French, although Reda understands Arabic, but only seems to respond in French.Although they find many people on the road: "There's the scary old woman they pick up at the border of Bosnia on the way to Belgrade, and the talkative Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian), who helps them on the border of Turkey, the reticent and timid women wearing burqas on the way to Damascus "the focus is always on incompatible father and son. a conversation in the film that makes it pleasing to their eyes.You see magnificent views in every city they go.The director even shows the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, although the film is not relatively long. Ge I really do not like movies that do not. has enough dialogue and draws its power from the subtleties of the camera, but this was really great. Despite some unanswered details (such as Reda's invisible French girlfriend) the film attracts the senses. A great work of art and remember that this film is the debut of Ismaël Ferroukhi.
