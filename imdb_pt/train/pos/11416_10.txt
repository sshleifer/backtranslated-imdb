An excellent family movie ... gives a lot to think about ... There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it's so ... real ... these things can happen in everyone's life. And do not forget to act - it's simply amazing! Just look at Frankie and you know what I thought about ... This photo is a real must not miss!
