The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte come together to give us some interesting performances and themes in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting twist on the themes of It's a Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two belong to a special class of poor older Jews in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his craft, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He is reduced to asking for well-being. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cries out to God for some help. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe if he'd gotten someone like Henry Travers, things might have worked differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had something for him, he was more than 100 years out of this deadly reel and all his ties to earthly things had disappeared. God sent Mostel something completely different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who should have at least received some basic training for the angels before receiving a designation. <br /> <br /> Belafonte did not accept that he has changed his life, he is still has many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he was aired, hit by a car early in the movie. You put your problems and the problems of Mostel and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance for Polish / Jew. actress Ida Kaminsky who received a nomination for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years ago. The other important role here is that of the Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a good Jewish doctor. Remembering O'Shea's accent from The Verdict, I was really surprised to see him and to hear him carry the doctor's part. <br /> <br /> The angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. . It is brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Be sure to pick it up when transmitted.
