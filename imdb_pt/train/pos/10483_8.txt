Yes, this movie is predictable and definitely not awarded. But then do not try to be anything that is not. A joke full of fun, with a very funny and stellar performance of Peter O'Toole, a solo and terraformed performance by Joan Plowright. The performance of the band was spot on, each playing its part in a clever and comical way. The music was good, but not great, but filled the movie well. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some humor went over their heads. A good example is the "strange baseball game" comment, well, my dear American, who was cricket - from which baseball is derived - and the explanation for the American band was very funny for those who know cricket. . Neither should you shudder when Carl smashed a window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" to get more money for the breakup and the manager said at the same time "oh no" also referring to the money. Wow, it seems that every joke should be explained to some people ... For all this, I liked it and had great laughs! Worth seeing.
