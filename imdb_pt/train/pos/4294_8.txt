There was not a dry eye in the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the movie theater, having seen this movie gem in a crowded house as part of this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And the shed tears were all laughter. This movie was hilarious, there is no other way to say it. There was no boring part in it, I laughed through her and all the others, of us, three hundred lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was absolutely fantastic. A great clown if it is necessary and serious, if the situation demands. The performance was obviously completely exaggerated, but that was exactly what history needed and what made it work so well. Equally excellent was Charlotte Gainsbourg, who loves to see a lot, and her mother also performed very strongly. The sisters could have been more detailed in terms of character script, but besides, there's nothing to whine about. I had a great afternoon watching this movie while Hamburg was drowning in the rain outside, and I would like films like this one from France to be regularly released in Germany. But distributors in this country do not seem to understand that the French make good films. I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because the movie I need at home to watch several times over!
