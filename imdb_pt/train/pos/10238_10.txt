People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this film is no exception. Some movies I love did bad at the box office, but, I'm happy to say, this movie is not one of them (more than nine million dollars, which I think was not bad at the time). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and non-diffused, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I do not think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for small children (the target audience for this movie) but I thought that what happened to the scary teacher at the end was a bit too dark for children movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and charming classic that I love for years.
