This is the first movie I've seen from John Singleton and he's a good director. The movie starts with a lot of freshmen and shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial purse and having difficulty tracking his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and beings dating Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped and becomes friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and is not sure which way to go. Michael Rapaport is an Idaho boy who falls in love with a group of neo-Nazis and his leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science teacher who tries to help them. It's a great movie and it's a shame that the studio has made several cuts in the film.
