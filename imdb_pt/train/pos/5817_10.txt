If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This movie features sweet melodies, MJ as a robot and a crazy and confusing plot. I remember, many nights, moving on to this movie of great quality in college, and pondering on the wonders of who decided to illuminate this ridiculous part. <br /> <br /> There are many songs. Lots of dancing. There's a lot of music while we dance. MJ kills you as you would expect when it comes to these things. But there is much more in this film. There is claymation. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to combat in a dance outside (obviously clay too). There's Joe Pesci too (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - We love you, Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
