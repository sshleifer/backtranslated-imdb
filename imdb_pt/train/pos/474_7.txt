Not having read Nabokov and not knowing anything about chess, I could only see "The Luzhin Defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> Works very well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances". Chess comes to life as a tough competition far more than in, say, "Searching for Bobby Fischer," in showing how much mental work can be difficult, requiring thought, preparation, endurance, and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative pieces are provided. Through feminist director Maureen Gorris (of "Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens through her transforming relationship. with the intense genius of John-Turturro's chess, with a unique note and absence of spirit. <br /> <br /> The scenarios in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/27/2001)
