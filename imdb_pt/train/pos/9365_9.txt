I saw this in a session last night too. I was totally impressed with how much better this movie was than I expected. Not many movies combine shady comedy and drama of current events, and do not crumble at the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I will not bother the plot much because I think the less you know about this movie, it makes it much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much funnier than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was as believable as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good rhythm. I'd say 90% of the audience laughed through most of the film. In the middle of the movie, the speed slows down to end the drama and does a really cool job of putting it all together. <br /> <br /> I also found it really cool how, instead of playing the black friend / white friend they decided to just ignore it and focus on relationships.
