I had never heard of this movie before I saw it, I wondered if it was an independent movie, and I was right, but with a good cast I decided by chance. Basically the wanderer Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (JT Walsh of Pleasantville) he receives a large sum of money, mistaken for a murderer he has hired to kill his infidel wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money and tells Suzanne, and after she makes a counterproposal, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael firing with a big gun, until he gets into a car with Dallas' Lyle (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the man he was cheated on, and he makes a quick withdrawal. He returns to Suzanne, and knowing that both are in danger, they plan to leave the city together, and add another complication falling in love with each other. Before they leave, Suzanne insists that they go and steal a large sum of money in the safe. Of course things will not go well, and Wayne and Lyle catch up with them, and Lyle forces them and now ties Wayne in to get the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get together on a moving train, but it's obvious she cares more about the money, and gets what she deserves as well. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, with the exception of perhaps a lame Boyle, are all good and elegant, and have a pretty good noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very good!
