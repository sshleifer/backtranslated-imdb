I remember the first time I saw this movie - I was at the office working over the weekend and the TV was on because of the background noise. But I gradually found myself more and more engaged in this movie that I had never seen or heard of until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life and Death (the British title - Ladder to Heaven in the USA) is charming, engaging, capricious and moving, all in a superbly written, well-represented and perfectly directed package. It's a classic that really ranks up there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, it was with the wind, citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. Why have you never received the same public notice and prominence from the video store? Luckily, SOME well-informed critics put it on their "Top 100 All-Time" charts. There is hope - the 1940 Fantasy was not a success until the 1960s, and the Wizard of Oz was a box office failure, but it was hit by TV. Buy it - Rent it - Watch it - Demand it! You will NOT be disappointed!
