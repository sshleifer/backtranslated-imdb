I will begin by saying that I am very satisfied with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, please do not ruin this by making a sequence of years or a prequela. Just leave it alone. Right ... as talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it looks like he was just meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne films, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. Fix what works and add a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the information we get from 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' encompasses everything in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the killers are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of movies around the CIA agents and how the CIA gathered their Intel and this movie is out on the street, making it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the 2 previous installments .. you will still enjoy the movie completely, but I would still recommend that you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become part of his world. This allows you to enjoy and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the first two, but I personally think 'Ultimatum' can only have the advantage when comparing the trilogy.
