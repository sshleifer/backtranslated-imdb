The horse is indeed a good animal. Picturesque portraits of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply great. The beautiful animation forms the backbone of the beauty that horses encourage in the film. Moreover, when the stallion crosses several lands, it jumps over cliffs and braves. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music attracts you to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> "They say the story of the West was written from the saddle of a horse." huh? Well, the story of a fine horse was certainly written from the saddle of the west. <br /> <br /> After all, this movie is clearly up there with the best. It's one of the best animated films I've watched. It would be a very good choice on a lonely night. An easy 9/10.
