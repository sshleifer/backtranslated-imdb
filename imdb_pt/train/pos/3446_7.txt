Yesterday I watched the world premiere of "Descida" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a great time. It was sold and watched by all the big stars, including fellow My-Spacer Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 starts with 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> The movie Starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can imagine the typical college environment with parties and flirtations in progress. The picture in this movie was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become loved. It appears like any other relationship in the beginning. The man is in search of attention and affection of the woman and the woman is playing hard to achieve. Both played well. Very innocent flirting between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything collapses. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very gloomy and dark. They end up in the basement, which is extremely dark and lit by lots of candles. It really reminded me of a dungeon. This is where he shows his true colors and continues to rape her. This is a very dark and violent rape scene. This scene is not for the young or the faint of heart. The rape scene is a bit long and hard to bear, but is needed for the rest of the movie that follows. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her soul for drugs and sex. It falls into its own abyss. She starts attending the craziest parties and wakes up one morning in a room without remembering how she got there. She is told to go see Adrian (Patrick Marcus). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone who needs to be saved". He is really the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a dependency relationship that comes into play later in the movie. The scenes of the club at this point in the film are photographed with extreme skill. I thought they were well done and noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the show during the credits by the audience. <br /> <br /> Maya is back in college as a TV assistant and who is in her class - Jared his rapist! You could see the confusion and emotion in Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next ?? The shots of your face and emotions are invaluable. <br /> <br /> What happens next is not really what is happening. She acts interested in Jared. She seems to be looking to relive the relationship and be loved again. I was sitting there saying that this really could be happening. It was not. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites you to her apartment and of course he shows up. Now her apartment is dark and sandy. She takes it off completely. He thinks he's going to get lucky. She then plays with him as any woman can. She is caressing him everywhere and he is getting excited. Note: For anyone planning to see this movie, this scene is a complete frontal nudity - it may not be right for the younger viewer. <br /> <br /> She then transforms the situation and she becomes the beast and continues to rape him. Again, the scene is dark, sandy and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you are going to see the movie and do not want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go to the last one. Paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is where Adrian gets back in the picture. Maya has Adrian saving her doing extremely tough male sex with Jared. She thinks this is the ultimate revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's masculinity and strips his dignity for nothing. Marcus, like Adrian, interprets this scene as believable as anyone can. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and the force appears across the screen. After the film, during a question and answer session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her, but I do not think that will happen. One of the final scenes has a close-up of Mays face and you see a tear rolling down your cheek. This was a fabulous scene and evokes constant discussions of who will see this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted? Was it as satisfying as she'd hoped? In my opinion, this does not happen. It just makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, it will play roles well, and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking of going to see it. I would be a bit hesitant if I was less than 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be commended for well-done jobs. Direction and photography should also be commended. It was a night I liked.
