This is a wonderfully written and well-portrayed psychological drama. It's not really a horror movie, so anyone looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me in this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Instead of advancing an agenda, the filmmakers just told the story, said well and let the viewer think about it. Scattered soundscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth's paintings and surprisingly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good movie on a small budget, with no big studios, famous actors, famous directors (this was way better than many Hitchcock films), special effects or twists intelligent ".
