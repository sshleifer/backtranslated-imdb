This film is an impressive piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best filmmakers of the last 50 years. Its performance shocks, entertains, angers and enchants you, leaving you breathless. This film was filmed in the early days of his film career and is very raw, but is still able to convey the domain of Depardieu. Must do for any Depardieu fan and by far his best initial work.
