This film is considered one of my 10 favorite movies of all time. Many people seeing this for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes of the film probably will not understand why I find it so fascinating, so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical details and cultural insights, and although it has some small anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. The story is a retelling of the famous duel between the Benkei monk and the young prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo bridge. During the fight, according to legend, Yoshitsune defeated Benkei and the monk became the prince's faithful servant. This film is a review of this story and involves war, gloomy prophecy and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", which is the prophecy of the Buddha that 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan, after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It's a time of demons. <br /> <br /> Next, you have the way the film solves the issue of Yoshitsune's sword training by Karuma's Tenku (Raven Goblins). The defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals. This is said to be where the ninja clans began historically. Yoshitsune's representation in Gojo accommodates all this well. <br /> <br /> Then there is Benkei, and the various lineages of Buddhism portrayed, including a lot of esoteric Buddhism of the Shingon sect. These are all described quite accurately, and just to add a little more, the film manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it an integral part of the story, that is, uses magical realism to add a dimension extra to the story. film, but in such a way as to make it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> All-in-all is full of fascinating nibbles and rings amazingly true to life for the period. The scenery and the costumes are also completely unforgettable and authentic. The soundtrack is great, very disturbing and sinister. I also found that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great thoughtful anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is portrayed as a young man who tests his limits and becomes increasingly drunk on his own, and Tetsukichi, the sword saber, makes an interesting depiction of the "common man" and his less than flattering view of assassins who imagine their social bettors. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, to see why it is so good, I really suggest you dredge up an old book on Japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lightweight story of Robin Hood against Little John in a bloody tale of intrigue, violence and hellish karma.
