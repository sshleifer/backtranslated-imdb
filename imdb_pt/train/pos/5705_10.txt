A wonderful musical film by Rene Clair, as entertaining and witty as his silent "The Straw Hat Italian." Using sound expressively and not just for dialogues and effects, Clair influenced early American musicals (the opera scene of A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Must (but not) be seen by all moviegoers, and the Criterion DVD is just as good as you'd expect. There are not a ton of extras, but most of the DVD extras I've seen are useless, and Clair's on-disc interview is one I've never seen. Acquire while you're still there.
