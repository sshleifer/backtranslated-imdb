Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that pulls the strings of his heart harder than a half-solo rock guitarist, "Seven Pounds" goes through the director's previous collaboration with The Pursuit of Happiness, movie that I also loved. . Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of your films may go unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is not so well known. <br /> <br /> Pity that I discovered Will Smith's scheme from the beginning, I put two and two together when he called his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when the character of Rosario Dawson is presented as having a Incurable Heart However, I still think the writer / director made the right choice by putting the bookends (the bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it is the source of urgency and tension in the film, gradually discovering how exactly a man could be brought to this supreme sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing always in the back of the mind what was in store for these two unfortunate <br /> < One of my friends with whom I watched the film thought that Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected, still at other times he can it would have been hard and scary, and when he is alone The full weight of his situation was too much for him and he falls apart. It's a very versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget to mention the staging of the scene of the accident, which was actually very impressive in terms of cinematography paired with music. Put this on your list.
