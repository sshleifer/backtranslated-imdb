THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegantly costumed and reproduced piece of history that benefits from some fine tuning, Jean-Marc Vall√©e's solid direction from Julian Fellowes' vigorous version of the young girl who would become the longest reigning monarch in England - Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, the part in which Victoria is a child whose ascension to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag on and get lost in multiple fantasies and scenarios. variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the film blossoms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between infantile passion and royal dignity that makes it a good move for those in court who would seek to control the "queen of children" - including her secretary, Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures in her role as queen, her eyes focus on the dashing German Prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in everyone's memory is accompanied by the concept of joining royalty with the care of her subjects. to Albert's sensibility. The film takes us to the birth of the first of nine children and ends with some statements about the influence of the effect of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It's a fantasy drama night and lets us enjoy the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if not epic carry. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
