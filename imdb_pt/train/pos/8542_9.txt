_Waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the wounded in the spine with skill. From the small torments of defective fluorescent lights going through the overload of sexuality, manhood and depression, the experience of the deficiency is exposed. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the central characters underscores the complexity of the material examined - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the Negro with a dark past, and Bloss, the racist biker. At first, these men are not united by anything other than the nature of their wounds, but they keep their spirit competitive. Over time, shared experience, both good and bad, unites them as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious of transformations is that experienced by Joel, who initially distances himself from his fellow patients wearing sunglasses. , headphones and curtains. By accepting the changes that disability has made in his life, Joel discards these props and begins to engage in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward. <br /> <br /> The dance mentioned in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep your head above water; to give up dancing is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels, and I have no hesitation in recommending it.
