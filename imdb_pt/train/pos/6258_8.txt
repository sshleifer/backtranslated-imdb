They probably could have skipped a bit from the start - I do not know why this starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it was because beginning in the Mediterranean, they could have approached more from modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of the cameras and teams arrives at the Bakhtyari tribe, it's the beginning of an incredible journey of 48 days. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this incredible journey through what appears to be a very fast moving Karun river. They use rafts that are kept floating by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs have been removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I'm guessing about a 60 degree increase. <br /> <br /> Just to see this was incredible, but there was much more to come. To reach the pastures, they also had to cross a large mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was quite amazing in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of this documentary were some of the inter-titles with more attempts at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the age of silence, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only faces, but conquers. This is just an incredible document from a little-known group of people facing all sorts of challenges.
