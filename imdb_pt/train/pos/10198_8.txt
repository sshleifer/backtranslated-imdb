I am indebted to Cesar Montano and his team in reliving the understorey of the movie once dying Visayan. "Panaghoy" is hopeful the precursor of a resurgence in this vernacular (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details are reminiscent of this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: the piegas and blistering act of the American antagonist. The other item I did not like was the lack of authenticity in the "period" fantasy of the same character, and most of all, his shiny red car kit which I suppose should be a roadster from the 1930s. Without those little details still glaring, "Panaghoy" would have been at least a 9 out of 10 in my rating - salamat daghang, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This film certainly surpasses "Oro, Plata, Mata" by Peque Gallaga, which provided a different view of the Visayas during World War II. In addition, there are some parts in which cinematography refers to Spielberg's "The Color Purple," and the plot begins to become reminiscent of "Noli Me Tangere."
