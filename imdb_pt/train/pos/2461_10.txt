Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" reaches all brands. The acting is magnificent, 70mm cinematography is beautiful, the Oscar-nominated costumes and settings are impressive, and Patrick Doyle's (also Oscar-nominated) soundtrack is touching and touching. Ah yes - the script of a guy named Will S. is not bad either. Film critics gave Branagh the Oscar award for "adapting" the script, but his decision to use the full text was quite brave. I can not think of many better ways to fly four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision Branagh does brilliantly: the use of the Blenheim Palace of England for exteriors, the Edwardian dress and the staging of "To be or not to be" in a room of mirrors, to to name a few. The cast of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in small parts can be a distraction. The main cast stands out: Derek Jacobi captures the conflictual nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet describes Descartes's descent to madness sharply; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrait of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect as the conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates Horatio's potentially ungrateful role to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there is not a moment lost in the whole movie. The final scenes amplify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. Branagh's Hamlet is a daring, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to combine the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent images. Is it arguably the greatest Shakespeare adaptation ever filmed? Strong praise, but well deserved.
