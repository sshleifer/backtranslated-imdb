I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He is the best HK action movie star alive ... and consequently - This movie rocked! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of the mainstream video store, I did not register its presence at the beginning, and had to look twice. I knew immediately what I would be renting. My only scruple (I guess I expected) is that it was dubbed (AAARGh) and not subtitled. In addition, the original / weird / cool plot of the movie, and full of action, made him one of the best movies of Jet Li ... even if everyone falls into this category ....
