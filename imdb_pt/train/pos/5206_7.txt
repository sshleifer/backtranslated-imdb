This film Evil Breed: The legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort. It is ridiculed with the specifications of the ultra-rapid death of the slasher style and the disgusting acts of death. The acting was classified as D, since the actors show little ability, and the stupidity of them in the film is questionable too. The way they portrayed what people their age acted was incredibly different. The strange division of pornography is considered something that does not really offer much, and any area that is respectable, but is quickly slaughtered with an absolute death. Example is the poor fellow who is disemboweled from his anus, and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. It's terribly obvious how little fight the kids put on. This movie is a good choice for those who like to watch some horrible deaths and practically torture.
