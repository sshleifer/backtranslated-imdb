Hitchcock shows his understanding already developed for visuals in this old silent film. The plot of the film, involving two boxing fighters fighting for a girl, is a direct drama without much to recommend it. Hitchcock's talent, however, is found in his impressive use of images. Almost all scenes are full of visual symbols. Especially memorable is the jewelry that a boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He slides her arm in a clearly sexual way and with a simple movement, Hitch has shown us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point shots that once again prove just how much ahead of his time Hitchcock was. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The object of boxers' desires is driven by money and lust, not by reason or love. The only other women in the movie are beautiful party girls who make open sex offers or old ladies who help destroy happy relationships. All in all, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and its development as a visual storyteller.
