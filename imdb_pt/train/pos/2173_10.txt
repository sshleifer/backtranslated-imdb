Often it is only after years that we can look back and see those stars that are truly stars. As the French film critic, whose name escapes me, said: "There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, there is only Louise Brooks"; and there is, thank God! Louise Brooks! This is the third of his European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film for being one, if not the first, French, followed by a script written by the renowned Ren√© Clair, for allegedly being finalized (the direction, of course) by Georg Pabst, and for incorporating the voice of Edith Piaf before she is well known! So much talent working and in a movie, how could it not be a masterpiece? And that's what this movie is. It's a shame that Louise Brooks was banished by Hollywood when she returned to the United States - so much talent thrown so arrogantly by the wayside! In the film, besides watching Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see photos of Paris ca. 1930 and to hear the young voice of Piaf. I never get tired of this movie!
