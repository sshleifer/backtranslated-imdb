The Spanish films are in one, if not in gold, definitely an era of silver. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although feelings are strong or almost in life or on the level of death, they are still not really melodramatic. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here that connect. One is about the retarded girl, who does not dare cross the street to the next block. One is about the middle-aged woman who finds the mistress of her life in a fetishist's feet. Another is about the girl with drug problems that her lover leaves. Another is still about the lady of a brothel who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain that filmmakers take women seriously.
