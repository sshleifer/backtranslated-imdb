I remember watching "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and I wondered why she always cried in the last minutes. I, of course, found the whole movie hilarious, particularly the mannerisms of the characters. It was not until I was much older and watched again that I realized how much deeper this show really is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as reluctant mediators. Keaton ceases to amaze me with his actual style of line delivery, and Watanabe adds humor and excitement to the mix. I also found that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply fabulous in her role of comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the '80s. We can all learn a lesson from the union of American and Japanese workers in this movie ... sometimes you really * may * have " the best of both worlds". And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in those final moments. I'd rather have one of those cars too.
