This movie is harmless escapist fun. Something missing from the recent Tomb Raider movie. I can not wait to get the DVD. As people can give a low score and still go and see the Titanic without a guilty conscience I do not know. Anything with Karen Kopins in panties needs to evaluate one or two extra points!
