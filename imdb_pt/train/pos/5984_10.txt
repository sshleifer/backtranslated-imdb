This is a great movie, if seen in the appropriate context - it was meant to be a parody of teenage horror devil worship movies (and the 80s saw many of them)! I saw this movie when it was released, and instantly enjoyed it. Being a big KISS fan, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a preacher who hates metal can not be all bad! Plus, Fastway was already one of my favorites so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. The original VHS (this was pre-DVD) cover for Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" looking on. It was a special order, and the price of the VHS copy at the time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not at this ridiculous price. The 'OZZY-Gene' cover was created just for the $ 5 re-release. The company you're pitching probably figured out that Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie, so you'd better put them on the cover! Same thing with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for five minutes, but now they put it on the cover as if it were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "trick or treat" website, and it's amazing how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate this myth by dedicating its soundtrack album to 'Sammi Curr'. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was just a good time, a rock-n-roll movie. Definitely should not be taken too seriously, but just appreciated!
