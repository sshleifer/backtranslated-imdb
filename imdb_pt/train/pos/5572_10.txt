This movie was hysterical. I had not laughed that much in a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting," but should it be? I actually got into the advanced selection expecting much less and I was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is hot and amazing. The whole audience I exhibited seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did.
