Being an otaku since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime ever. Whereas when it was done, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, this does not detract from the pleasure of watching the film. Although it has been described as being "sentimental", it should be borne in mind that females do not react in the same way as males. As the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily have to resort to "macho" tactics to win the respect of her peers. Noriko's seiryuu, by the way, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is so three-dimensional that a cartoon can arrive; his personality captures the essence of a witty girl who at first seems completely helpless, but in the end succeeds with the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the wick looked a bit like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a somewhat dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a velvet giant cloak around itself in true Dracula style) technique. I doubt the scene was meant to be funny, but it shook me. Still, I would rate Gunbuster in the top 20 anime ever.
