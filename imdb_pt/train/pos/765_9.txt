I think when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz and ballet dancing. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that could rival "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose" because both films focused on how the dance had been used by people to express their feelings. <br /> <br /> The break dance scenes on "Beat Street" comes shortly before the middle and end of the movie. And I loved them all. Almost all of the break-up tricks were featured in the break jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flames, the head spinning, the suicide sitting, the crazy legs, the deadly, the forward-facing, figure four - almost everything. Like "The Warriors," "Beat Street" has gang-related violence in the hip hop world ... but in a much less violent way than the first. The only big fight scene on "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who in the movie was abbreviated as "Ramo") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York subway tracks. the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that trail. Well, although this chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died like that than having blood exploded from a gang shot. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang stuff in the movie was graffiti related to hip-hop. culture and rap. Lots of rap music appeared in the movie because hip-hop members used rap as a distraction for the negative aspects of gang life. Even the movie's theme song, which closed the film's curtain, was not just a tribute to hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I think the orchestra drummer led by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making an appearance.
