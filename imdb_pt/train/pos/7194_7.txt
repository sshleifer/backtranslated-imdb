I rate this the best of the Zorro chapter games. The thrilling soundtrack adds impact to an exciting screen game. There is an excellent support cast and a mysterious villain who will keep you guessing until the last chapter. Hill Hadley does a good job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro. Last but certainly not least, he is the great management team of Whitney and English.
