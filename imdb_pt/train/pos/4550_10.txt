Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor in the world. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, Irish thief in love on behalf of his father, an impudent, violent butcher in New York gang (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). Their roles all influence each other, but each is separate and absolutely unique. He changes completely, with every character he assumes. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act like anything. Anything. Like Cristy Brown, he's awesome. He does not ridicule the character and has no pity for the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. An intelligent man. A scandalous man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film, despite the minor flaws of scene transition and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No, I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and their friends. This is where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches a climax of acting. "I'm going to kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's lively." "Get out of the cripple!" And your performance never slows down, it never fails and it's beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch again, and I never tire of Cristy's keen eyes, guttural speeches, and contractions. <br /> <br /> A must-see. Fo sho, yo!
