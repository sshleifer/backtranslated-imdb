This is one of the best movies ever made. It is a realistic depiction of rural livestock farming, which was a large part of American history. The setting is 1906 Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the previous century. The movie keeps its interest without the added Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this film and be intrigued about what life was like in America when it came primarily to a rural nation. With this movie, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. In a beautiful, picturesque environment, you'll see the difficult physical work needed to survive, as well as the constant concerns and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make the difference between success or failure. Watch this movie and experience life as it has for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth your time to watch. My only question is, why are not there more movies like this?
