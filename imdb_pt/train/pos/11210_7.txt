Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was a very lucky woman many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she set about providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on their property plots. Trudy also raised two chimpanzees in her house to look more like children. They wore clothing and had many amenities. One day, she discovers an abandoned baby gorilla. Not knowing anything about the great apes, she relies on her husband's medical skills and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides that she will also create the gorilla as one of her children. This has worked well for years and Buddy the Gorilla is an incredibly smart addition to your home. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and his monkey develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and culture. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla, but a mechanic in the movie, but he's very close to looking totally real. Russian gives a good performance as a lady before her time and the support players are also very good. The costumes are exemplary, as consistent with the previous era of history, and the exceptional settings and production values. But more importantly, the animals are here in abundance, not just Buddy, but the lovely chimpanzees, the ducks, the rabbits and so on. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to the animal sky, here on Earth, this is a great choice of movies. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family movie, will be "monkeys" about Buddy.
