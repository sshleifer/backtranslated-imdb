Last November, I had the chance to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say it was a lot of fun. Some flaws aside, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the guy who played the lead role. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit for. I had a chance to talk to some of the filmmakers after this was done, and they looked really cool. In short, the whole movie was just a positive experience, and I would definitely recommend it. The story was fun and cool, as a woman I've been through many of the same problems as the leader, and I really could understand their problems because of this. The film does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The film's friends are very well written, they are realistic. I know people like that, I just wish Imy's friends and I might sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is really cool, I wish there were more movies like that. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
