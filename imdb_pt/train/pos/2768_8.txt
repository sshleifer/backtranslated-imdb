In addition to Susan Hayward's timber delivery throughout this film, it was as good as any biblical movie ever made. Henry King deals with this film with respect for an epic in every little scene, and Peck is, as always, flawless. The stimulating soundtrack of Alfred Newman, with the hectic twenty-third psalm, is unforgettable even after so many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit cheesy, but not so badly made for the time when this movie was made. This goes well alongside the smaller biblical epics of the day, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." Worth watching, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the prophet Nathan. The film is completed by the always good James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's first wife.
