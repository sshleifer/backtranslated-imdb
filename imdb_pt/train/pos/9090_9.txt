"Hollywood Hotel" is an exciting, exuberant and wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from Warners that is sadly neglected. It should be remembered only for providing the official theme song from Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood". The score of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has several other gems, however, including the charming "I'm like a fish out of water" and "Silhouetted in the Moonlight". The best musical number is "Let It Be a Lesson for You," in which Dick Powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves "behind the eight balls," a fate that literally falls on Edgar Kennedy in the end number. The image celebrates the glamor of Hollywood and punches it all at once, as it causes so many pompous and ego-maniac actors and dubious studio executives to leave the scene. The cast includes a bunch of great character comedians - Allyn Joslyn as an astute press aide, Ted Healy as aspiring Dick Powell manager, Fritz Feld as an excitable restaurant, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy Mabel Todd, Mona's silly sister, and Hugh Herbert as his even more stupid father. The "racist" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where Herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo- "Gone With the Wind" sequence. It's of questionable taste, but it should not stop you from seeing the other delights in this movie, notably the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I believe to be the only record available in this amazing jazz combo. The sequel to "Dark Eyes" goes a bit too much and comes too late, but on the other hand, "Hollywood Hotel" is a worthy and certainly a movie that should be considered for the DVD release.
