It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily like almost every other American movie, and then be surprised when it does not happen. I like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The end, with one friend basically sacrificing for the other, thereby redeeming their previous bad behavior that put them in the situation in the first place, was very moving. I almost would have done without the last line, which proved that she did not actually do the act she confessed, because that would have made the film more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. Whether or not she did it was not so important. <br /> <br /> The story itself bordered on clich√©, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
