As a long time fan of Red Sox, I just had to go see the movie. It was great! Although there are never enough live scenes from the 2004 Red Sox season, there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the film is certainly a girls' movie, it has enough baseball footage of the incredible 2004 return of the Red Sox to make it one of my top 10 films of all time. I especially liked the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben is meeting his friends on draft day to determine who will get places for certain games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date or other significant one ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more especially if you are a fan of Red Sox !!!
