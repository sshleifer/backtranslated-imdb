Dirty Harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting his attackers in the goolies before killing them. Probably a more appropriate punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever as she and her sister have ... Anyway ... an action-packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The chief of the rapists, played by Andy Drake, is suitably despicable and receives his punishment at the end (of course!). It's not a classic movie, but better than the others except the original Dirty Harry.
