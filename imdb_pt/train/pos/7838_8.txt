If you are a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I recommend you check this out. It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan, just like Ringo Starr, apparently having a good time filming some of the scenes that are not part of the show, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of knowing them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. Seeing you in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some great music with some good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr showing up in some of the live performances. It's true that there are some songs that you would like to see there, but like any album, you can not have it all. I just bought it in 2006, but if I knew it came out in 1972, I definitely would have bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, never learned to drive and died in a car accident!
