It's a pity that this movie is so hard to come by in the US. I found it through a rare video reseller, and it certainly was worth it. This is undoubtedly the best film made during the pre-code era and the best movie of the 1930s. Masterful director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the Depression, and with the MAN CASTLE he created a fairy tale in the difficulties of the time. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them, and they help make this movie a wonderful novel. Young's trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy's Bill is rude and closed. The dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult relationships, but ultimately rewarding in the film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the softest pre-encoding movie I've ever seen. Borzage uses the nebulous and dreamy technique to transform the village of squatters where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The difficulties of the Depression are never ignored, in fact they are an integral part of the film. But as Borzage creates the movie as a fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh. Makes the film warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the greatest achievement of the pre-code era. If only more people could see.
