For films like Aweigh Anchors, few were awarded so many Oscar awards in a warm-up for happy hour. Or 1945 was a year harassed for a good movie or they were still suffering a shock from Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" that they wrote anything starting with A on the ballot for better picture to please the public still faithful musical picture. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in 'Singin' in the Rain ', then there had to be something wrong with the behind-the-scenes rigging systems at MGM. Of course the studio is on its best behavior during such a lauded tour of major studios and Hollywood, useful to those who are trapped on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> However, a sailor musical with Gene's brilliant talent and Frank Sinatra is certainly a nice farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the premieres of the musical so that today's audience was not slapped with an unnecessary runtime. There were many longer pieces before and after, but in this case all the lovely scenes of Kathryn Grayson could have been eliminated. Until the 'Kiss Me Kate' show, it may have been necessary for non-opera enthusiasts to watch any of their remote-controlled movies at hand. <br /> <br /> If there was a need to practice women in 1949, "On the Town", perhaps the coast would leave the lucky sailors not needing to promise a hearing with Jose Iturbi and to jump on the piano for a while. whole 'Susie' interpretation of heart. Few are fortunate enough to take a screen test at MGM's gold studios. So few are more fortunate to be served. There are no regrets about Susan Abbot's or Kathryn Grayson's successful screen tests, but it makes non-opera enthusiasts continue to hope that the eventual pink slip will be distributed to both. <br /> <br /> But for all, the star's talents are in good shape and an above-average score is thrown with a light but fun naval story intertwined with ambitious young good-looking young men for late bursts of morale of war. Anchors at least does not question the choice of the wrong MGM movie. The direction remains as the cast carries the story in lovely color cinematography. Whenever someone bursts into music or music, the film is a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> The natural highlight of the film is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasy land, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry the Mouse. This is a well-deserved masterpiece of Kelly's career, and it's good to know he thought of it before Fred Astaire started dancing on the walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly sit down with a triple taste. , powdered rainbow, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana sundae, but it is a square piece of sugar that somehow melts in the mouth and despite the guilt, it is still a nice feeling. Rating: 7/10
