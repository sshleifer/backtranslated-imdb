Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, creative and creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television in that state of development. There are no shows like this right now, but rather "housewife" puts Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful jokes of humor and wit that cover our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam entered the episode with such precision of acting and with his usual madness that I can not help thinking that Rod Serling was adapting the show a week ago around Elam even if he was an aid to the flow of history. This episode ends with a turnaround, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with the especially "Serlingesque" dexterity. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
