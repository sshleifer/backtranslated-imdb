The choice of Sylvester Stallone to play the protagonist of Renny Harlin is praiseworthy, since Stallone is that kind of tough and crude person who had previously provided the necessary audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing the Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is an absurd idea. <br /> <br /> The excellent opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue that will envelop them in the bloody and dangerous event that follows. meeting with outlaws. The robbery and the transfer of large amounts of money in suitcases from one plane to another is something that was not filmed before. <br /> <br /> The biting cold of the snow-covered Alps and the unfolding of fraud and betrayal among the antagonistic forces shakes with trepidation. The forces of incredible adventure and ruthless murder carry the drama to the end. <br /> <br /> Good movies are not made every year and people do not get a banquet for their eyes to watch from time to time. In addition to the dirty language / language that endows blatant excitement during certain scenes, the film can be regarded as one that will not fade its captivating appeal, even watching after so many years.
