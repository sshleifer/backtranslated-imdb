"Cinderella" is a movie about a young woman whose mother passed away and her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and had her do all the chores around the house, like cleaning the two evil sisters. One day the king sent a message to all single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella could not go, but her sister sisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought there was no way she could attend the royal ball until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back at midnight because that's when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes at midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her crystal slipper. Then the king orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched all the houses, but finally found the women to whom he belonged, Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best Disney animated films in 1950. This movie is about A Magical Fairy Tale. At the beginning of the movie, Cinderella was a servant of her own family and had no one to love her, but with a little magic all her life changed and she finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing in my house, so I'll never forget it. I also loved the part where Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized they were in love. Overall, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a kid, because every girl wants to live a fairytale life.
