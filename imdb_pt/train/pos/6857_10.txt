"Dressed to Kill" is one of the best thrillers of all time. His relationships with sex and violence make this an adult movie. Brian De Palma once again proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and the brilliant soundtrack of Pino Donnagio. Filmed on Panavision, the film must be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, on video, "Dressed to Kill," it's almost the same movie. Solid performances from her cast, superb direction and perhaps the best soundtrack of all time, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see.
