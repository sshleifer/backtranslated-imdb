Alain Chabat claims this film as his original idea, but the subject of the reluctant lovers who finally come together is as old, if not older, than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is a "vieux garcon," happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, five sisters and a matriarchal mother - the G7 - who decide he should get married. Enter the charming and charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte has to pretend to be Chabat's girlfriend and simply not show up on her wedding day. No more talking about the G7's wedding. Of course, the best plans are in the habit of getting out of control. <br /> <br /> There are very strong support roles of Lafont as a mother and Osterman as the brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic scenes as first Charlotte has to delight, then revolt the family. French farce with an English.
