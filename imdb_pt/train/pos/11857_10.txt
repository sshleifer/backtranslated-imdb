A lot of people are saying that Al Pacino acted, but I mean common obviously for a role in the cinema like this - a Cuban drug dealer you need a little more acting in that role with that Cuban accent. This movie overall was a very good movie that I even rated it as a 10/10 I would highly recommend people to watch this movie.
