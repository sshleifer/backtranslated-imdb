How It Is in Heaven {SPOILER'S WARNING) <br /> <br /> This was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable revisiting the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a talented superior musician, who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career, and has to give up. When he joins a church choir as his singer, he brings about a transformation in the life of chorus players, just as Jesus did for society in first-century Palestine. They laugh, they begin to speak openly and sincerely with one another, their faults are exposed, they accept each other, they love one another, they become a vital community. They include the young mentally disabled (Tore), such is their inclusion. The pastor, Stig, enjoyed authority by imposing suffocating morality on the congregation, and this is gradually rejected by choristers. When Stig rejects Daniel, there is a revolt and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of the days of Jesus whose insistence on obedience to Jewish law provided a stark contrast to the new life by the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone declares "the church invented sin." Throughout the film, there is this contrast between moralism and life (being). Faithful to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Conny, when he hits him, lets him drown in Rio. In the next scene, we can hardly believe when Daniel's body (resurrected!) is dragged to his room (the tomb) wrapped in a white linen sheet (the shroud!), by three women (three women guarded at the foot of the cross). Daniel is intimately connected with Lena, a beautiful young woman who was betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous (Jesus developed an intimate relationship with Mary Magdalene). Lena, who was probably a high-class courtesan / prostitute. Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he craved, and now finds satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, tries to live a full life, in contrast to moral correction. This leads to concern for sin, and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the whole chorus singing / humming in harmony, like a mantra, attracting the great public, exemplifying the harmony and interconnection that is our true human destiny.
