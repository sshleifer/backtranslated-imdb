OK, OK, do not get unbalanced. I was kidding. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is really a better and truer title at any time. Racism and crime dramas receive the satirical treat of our X-rated animation friend Ralphie boy And he does one of his best jobs here. <br /> <br /> In front of the crime, show the truth. They build, they defend, so the boredom and the stronger rivals cause them (perhaps) to lose it. See for yourself to see what happens. Racist? I do not know. With Scatman (RIP) and love walruses (also RIP) being black and the main point of view, I saw this as an attack on racism mainly. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it also says very well. And the younger (pre "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas there was a good surprise. <br /> <br /> It is an animated film of "Blacksploitation". This is a good thing. Done well and well done. It will make some contortions (like the lynching scene), but unfortunately this is based on facts. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie REALLY should have rethought that title.
