I really liked this movie. The animation was well done and the novel was funny. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and Hans Zimmer's score was excellent. What many people do not realize is how well it relates to the themes Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when so-called "civilization" invades someone's home, what it means to be "civilized", etc.). The opening scene and the music were very hectic. The film is a lament to an America that once was beautiful.
