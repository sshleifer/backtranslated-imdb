Although the storyline was a little trite at times, and VERY hurried at the end, as if the director had run out of time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was very good for Made-For-Backwoods. Genre -Cable-TV. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the nanny, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see more of her out there in the movies. The song was also well done, taking away all the possible shiver of tension type based on the music of dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think "JAWS"). <br /> <br /> I do not think I'd like to watch "While the Children Sleep" again, but if I did, it would focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno.
