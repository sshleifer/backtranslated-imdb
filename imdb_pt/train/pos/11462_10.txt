SPOILER ALERT! This film, Day Zero, gives an interior to the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there school. <br /> They go on a series of Self-Thought "Missions" all leading up to the huge mission, which is day zero. The contents of zero days are not specified until the middle to the end of the film. The viewer knows that he is serious and full of hatred, but it is never quite right until the end. Now we all know, if the film is based on the Columbine massacre, the ending is pretty obvious. And the ending is no different from any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their colleagues in the end. <br /> <br /> I've seen many movies in this attack, and this movie by Far is my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and the insider the lives of these two teenagers who hate life and honestly gives the viewer some understanding and a close to the terrible event. <br /> <br /> Being only 7 when the events held, I never knew the gravity of the shots, until my English class was assigned an essay or story at a defining moment in our generation. Well, I knew that everyone was going to choose the twin towers, but I wanted to be different, because of course the twin towers were tragic and very definite, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there really was no way. relate to it because, I was only in third grade and I had no idea what all this meant. But the filming broke and affected. I remember the interviews, the visions of the school sky, and the pain and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a compelling, realistic and horrible masterpiece, and I Message to Anyone.
