Whenever I see most of the comments, it's called 'flawless for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to take a look at some of the things he's doing these days, and perhaps soften his stance in retrospect ... "The Golden Child" is not an intellectual entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast, it gives new life to the ancients. clichés, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand the impregnating lack of 'love' for your efforts, after all. Perhaps he was released at a time when the establishment was tired of bare, exciting adventures? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; It is unfair to make this a scapegoat when what is possibly your greatest sin is also totally harmless. There is nothing necessarily wrong in trying to take advantage of the trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where the idea of ​​Hollywood mysticism begins and ends. What is more important than credibility with such a story is that the public has fun tourist guides on hand to show them the mysterious visions. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit this bill very well. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and get on the ride.
