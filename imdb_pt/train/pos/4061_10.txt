This is the best dublo I've ever heard from Disney, as well as the best adaptation from the biggest abuse of soundtracks, themes, characters, dialogs on the Kiki Deliveries Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This one has heroin and heroin (although I do not support the use of heroin and heroin here, since Miyazaki is out of the stereotype and common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited, surprised by Mononoke, disturbed by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo in the Takkyuubin, this one begins with a small doubt on my part. Wondering if this will be Ghibi's first failure. Well, in the end, just like Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 rating. I would give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling, encouraging people to see the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Somehow I see it as a sad movie, people die in this one, the solitary robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if humanity really could not live with much power. The collapsing scene gave me bits of Metropolis ending. It's sad in some way. The plot is apparent in most comments and the rules of the soundtrack too (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber.People who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a moment of amazing composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie sensation that used to be part of the US cinema in the classic days (It's a wonderful life etc etc). Well, things change ....
