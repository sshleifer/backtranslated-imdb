That's what makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the lovely Reece Shearsmith. Totally underrated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the bizarre slogans, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone should simply watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the gentleman's league is that it's always new and always goes over the edge. You do not have to rely on catchphrases (unlike Britain) to make it funny. the fact that the league is willing to kill, undoubtedly its most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they have steel balls.
