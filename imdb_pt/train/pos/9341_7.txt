Sandler is incredible again ... I've become a fan of Sandler. This movie is the saddest story of Sandler. Your expression is fantastic. I cried more by watching Click, but there are some similar points. Considering the value of the family before losing it and being able to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths of life ... It is difficult, it is real ... and indeed there is a real owner of this success, Binder . I do not think another director could give these emotions in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also incredible ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash. Do not expect laughter or very positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
