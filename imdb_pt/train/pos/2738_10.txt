I have not seen this in over 20 years, but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This movie could not have been made in color. The strong gray ones are what they do, and was life really that simple in the 1950s? What stands out most in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows. His breath beneath the hood just before they got out of the trap. I do not think I could watch it again ..... once is too much. It's like that nameless guy at the beginning of "Papillon," who is dragged in terror to the guillotine. The guy who said watching this on a double account with "Dead Man Walking" should have added the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live" as well. <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors being "aristos" went to the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are quite intense.
