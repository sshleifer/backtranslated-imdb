It's interesting how the research train can flow. I started looking at an article on "The Gates" of Christ in Central Park. The article claimed that the Maysles were Christ's filmographers for years. Hmmm ... So I started looking at your body of work. I believe one of them has passed, but the other is still filming Christ and Jean Claude in their creative stages. The Gray Gardens looked very interesting. Video Station in Boulder CO is the place to look for the obscure or infrequent and of course they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who lived in the past and, oh, what a glorious past it was. Edith had been well-born, born a Bouvier, married well, had many wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her early forties. His daughter Edie had been a debitant, a fashion model and had many beaus. She never married and sometime in her thirties she came home to recover. She seems to have some nervous disorder. Worry about things. It is only a shadow of the world in which they live, because Jackie O. came and graced the place so that her aunt and cousin were not expelled. It is a 28 room mansion that is worn and worn. But in the movie, you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you'll see it was a dirty mess. The clothes that Edie presents are very intelligent and creative. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to be naked, but she does not appear in the film. Edith was actually very beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still when she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty in her day and pretty attractive at age 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When the cat urinates behind Edith's portait, she states that "at least someone is doing what they want"!
