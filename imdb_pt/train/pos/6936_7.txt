Winchester 73 receives credit from many critics for bringing back the western after World War II. Director Anthony Mann should receive a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire stole the film with their interpretation of two bad guys involved in a high stakes game with the precious Winchester 73 going for the winner. This is a good script with several stories happening at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God, in a few years we would start letting the Indians perform in Western movies. The film is in black and white and was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but it gets an above-average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
