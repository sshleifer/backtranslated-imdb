Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" parts in her many years on the big screen, but she is best known for her "light and fluffy" material with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for that effort and it really does not matter what the competition was in the year it was first shown. Try to find a scene where it does not appear. And it was all heavy drama, grueling in its rhythm and resumes, the action, all at full speed. The makeup made her as young as possible and she fit into the category of 30 years, even in close-ups, but she was playing at half her age and at a very fast pace. The film, in general, was pretty well done, staged and filmed well with a strong support cast, but Keaton carried the load.
