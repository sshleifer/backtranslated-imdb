I saw this movie without knowing what happened to ... I am a fan of Branagh, even more of his Shakespeare films, and in the beginning, I just saw this ... and I ended up with tears in my head. eyes, because great, great serenity, values, affection and brave philosophy about the life of Helen's girl. Recommended for people who are bored with TV programming (in Spain, at least).
