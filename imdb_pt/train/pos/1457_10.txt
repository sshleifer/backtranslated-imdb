I've watched this documentary twice - and although I'm a big movie fan, most documentaries do not catch my eye. This film, however, was fascinating. Almost every shot is perfect - saying much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is incredible, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras Beads - Who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Incredible and excellent interview choices - filming from a factory in China - the movie makes you feel like you're really there. <br /> <br /> I have political consciousness - and I read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this movie that was a surprise to me. However, that made me think a lot. <br /> <br /> I would also like this world to be a better place. <br /> <br /> A million compliments to the filmmaker - and thank you for making that movie too. <br /> <I wish everyone could see.
