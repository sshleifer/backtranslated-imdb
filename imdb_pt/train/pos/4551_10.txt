I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a movie as I saw when Daniel Day-Lewis played Christy Brown on My Left Foot. In fact, out of the scene, his role was not over yet. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least with disabilities like him during the filming of the film and needed surgery because of the damage that his superior acting had done on his back. For me, this is remarkable, and through all the pain he put in to play that role, I believe it's quite true to say that he made the most Oscar-winning performance ever. He was so masterful in this difficult part that I believe no one could have done better or with more impact than he. Although I can not say that it is the greatest film of all time, I can say that as he played this impossible role and continued acting until he was no longer acting, it is undoubtedly the biggest feet I have ever seen an actor Faz. Probably a man too for that matter.
