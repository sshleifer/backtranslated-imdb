Although too young to remember the first show in the series (being just a baby), I later caught up with it on television in the late 1980s, just when I was interested in war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who showed me the series for the first time and also gave me my first interests, telling stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have devoured many books and seen many television series on the era of World War II with divergent opinions. British television stations are usually very good at producing them, as The World At War can easily attest, with many jewels made by both the BBC and independent companies. I strongly recommend such titles as "The Nazis - A Warning of History", "Blitz" and the BBC series on Dunkirk. "Britain At War In Color" with its series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of a high standard. The World At War is by far the best and, despite its age, never fails to deliver. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue to emerge and which obviously are not included in the series and of course that World War II occurred on such a large screen that producing a series with ALL the details would take more time and money then any other , even if such an undertaking were possible. What I feel I must say to those who say this does not include everything is that The World At War can not do this physically as a series, but it certainly can get you doing more research - and making it enjoyable. That certainly worked for me: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend it to anyone with a passing interest. The series was so well done that they find it difficult not to agree that it is a quality and highly informative programming.
