My Take: Makes use of his familiar plot with excellent performances and some genuine moments of emotion. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man is framed by a conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States, the first traitor to the US Secret Service. While his fellow Secret Service agents chase him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course we know he's innocent, and the real culprit is right there, but I was still entertained with SENTINEL. In this time when thrillers are reduced to being very ridiculous and very abundant in action sequences, the SENTINEL is a good lick-back for all those good old political crime thriller. The family plot is elevated by thrilling sequences and great performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is the longtime agent of the Secret Service Pete Garrison, who is framed for being part of a plot. to assassinate the president. Former secret service colleagues (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) chase after Harrison as he tries to figure out who is behind the possible murder and the traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to many chase scenes that, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never unbelievable. The screenplay also features a subplot involving Garrison having an affair with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, this was not unnecessary, as most subplots are for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> The film director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.), who manages to make the film look good. While many have criticized it as "it should have been a TV movie," I must disagree. Accordingly, this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigues like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode of the TV series 24 (which this movie resembles when it comes to style and star Sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot to serious heights and does not abandon even its smallest details. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, I recommend it, not perfect, but not too far away. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
