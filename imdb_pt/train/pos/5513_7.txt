From what I read, a lot of people were disappointed with this movie compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this, but after thinking a little I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his narrative based on the facts of Che's life that he began in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution going from unpromising origins to a successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that moves from unpromising origins to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life have completely different results. He boldly decides to tell the two quite directly. The viewer may feel much better coming out of the movies after Part 1 than Part 2, but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any failure of the director. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1, we saw different aspects of the war, once the guerrillas succeeded. In Part 2, they fail to pause and we see their numbers being constantly reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are well handled. The film is greatly enhanced by dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentine. So if you've seen Part 1, you'll see a very similar account of a very different story in Part 2.
