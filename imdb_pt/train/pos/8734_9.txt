The movie was totally awesome and cool. The graphics were great and it was amazing, especially, Flik was great and amazing in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was smart. The circus bugs are colorful and are superb in the movie. The locusts were also great and cool in the movie. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Even Dot was cute. When the bird comes to eat the insects, this scene was excellent and good. Even the last scene was amazing and cool. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the locusts. When the ants are building the artificial bird, that scene was nice and nice, I really should appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life."
