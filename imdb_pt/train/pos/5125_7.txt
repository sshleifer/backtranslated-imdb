I stood up to the bar hoping it was a hot beer on a stifling Texas day, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering with "Saturday Night Foolishness," I did not want to see a remake of some barn in South Texas ... and I did not. John Revolt was good as the jealous hick, Scott Glenn was an ex-convict, and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight. * Love this woman * In addition, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy who does not support the sound of country music]. A fun movie all the way.
