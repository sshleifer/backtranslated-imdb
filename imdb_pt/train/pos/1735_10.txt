The debut of Miss DeCarlo has everything writers could invent - from the Franco-Prussian War to the American Civil War, the Great American West, San Francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, bandits of stage trainers and a Chinese. trash. Only when you thought the plot could not get any more complicated, that's true. It is magnificent, tongue-tied on the cheek. The character of DeCarlo (here called Anna Marie - NOT Salom√©, the role she plays) is loosely based on the career of the famous Lola Montez, who was the lover of the Prussian king and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels. . She escaped to the American West. There is a town in Arizona called "Salome, where she danced," based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome there. StageCloach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fit into his charms are not historically accurate, nor do I presume he is the Scottish-accented Chinese sage - but it is one of my favorite camp classics and DeCarlo is incredibly handsome all over.
