Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film - cinematography, music and costumes are beautiful. In fact, this film is more beautiful than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the film as it was done several years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, as far as writing is concerned, the dialogue was well written and the story was sometimes interesting. However, the story was also quite depressing, though not involving in any way - after all, it is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, while prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, women STILL yearn for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, although the characters of Streets Of Shame are much less sympathetic and more one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So, overall it earns a 7 - mostly due to everything, BUT the writing. It is a pity that the weakest link in this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
