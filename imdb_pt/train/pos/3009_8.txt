A film that is both a 1930s Warner movie in an era in which each studio had a specific visual and style for its production, unlike today where simply getting the audience is the object. <br /> <br /> Curitz was one of the principals. The Warners House directors work with tight economy and great efficiency, creating quality work methods that were the requirements of a director of Warners, a studio that was one of the "five big "in this era producing quality films for their big chains. Although we have a scene from the upper classes on Long Island, there is Warner's generic style embedded here with a narrative that could have been "ripped from the headlines." Another example is when photographers comment on the girls' legs at the beginning of the film and she comments that "They are not the trophies" gives the film a more hardworking man to land, as these were the audiences that Warner was watching. in the Great Depression. (ironically, Columbia and Universal were the two smallest under these top five until the 1950s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have done something very cheap and without the polish and great talent) Curtiz created from an excellent movie script that moves at a fast pace, keeping the viewer with great camera angles and quick editing. <br /> <br /> Thank God there is no sub-plot of love interest so that the fun can continue rolling.
