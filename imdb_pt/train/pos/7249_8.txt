It is difficult for me to attribute the "fair" number of stars to this film, but I decided because of its high production values ​​and what was in 1968 an innovative approach to the war film. Remember also that I have not seen you since 1969. But it has made a strong impression. Long Day's Dying must be one of the most vivid anti-war films ever. It does this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe in 1944-45. No movie before this showed war on the infantry squad level with so many brutal details, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters become familiar and flat cliché. As "entertainment," the film does not, although it is clearly not intended to "entertain." He wanted to give him a blow to the head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern warfare in general. That was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before saving Private Ryan, both of which are much more "watchable" films. Here the flat and often unpleasant characters, the lack of a real plot and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first vomit on the screen in theatrical history) make the movie difficult, although they are only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when you're done, a bonus star for having your heart in the right place. Average: 8. Like the underestimated "The Victors" by Carl Foreman, an equally pessimistic but more interesting and thought-provoking film, The Long Day's Dying does not seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both movies are on the cable several times.
