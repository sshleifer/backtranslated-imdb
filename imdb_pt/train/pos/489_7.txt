Walking home after the movie, I was humming the familiar Waltz music that Natalia and Alexander were dancing. I've heard it before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), "I picked it up when I got in the door. It's" Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2 "composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, presented here by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was rewarding - there are fifteen tracks plus two tracks of the delightful waltz. It is not uncommon that we now have a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a rich soundtrack Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (early notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry.There are subtle nuances of stresses and strings notes, celestial , piano and harp. Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a paired performance that consumes credibility. The love story, their intimate connection, is very much between Alexander and Natalia - their childish and tormenting inner world, and your gender understanding and brave of him - a relationship just for the two of them. Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (Best Foreign Film of the Netherlands, 1996) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without the disturbing human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family efforts, love and respect. The initial subject is the mental game and the mathematical logic of chess. Below it may be a light tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920s. Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the border with Switzerland. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the soundtrack if you do not want to go to the movies. Alexandre Desplat's lyric score of "The Lighthin Defense" is complete.
