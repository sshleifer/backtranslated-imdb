I instantly fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show can put a smile on my face with its great narrative, ingenious dialogues and great acting. But that's not all: it can also keep you to the end. The basic idea behind the show - Bringing people back to life with a twist, ending the undead status with a second - is interesting and may still be in later times. But suspense murder cases, the program's unique appearance, and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than parts. It has a certain charm that I really like and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
