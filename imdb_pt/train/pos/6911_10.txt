While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" has launched Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. Specifically, the dictator suddenly falls dead, so Julia replaces the president by a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) filming a film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, balancing him with his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with that. No matter what they do in this movie, they do. This only shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Sonia Braga (who co-starred with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is sexy.
