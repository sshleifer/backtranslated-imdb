It was by chance that I was scanning the TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful humans who are attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin way to one another. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) TV Series "ER" 94 (Nicole). This girl and guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed the strings of your heart with a guy or girl you loved deeply and lost track of over the years. Jesse and Celine have a great conversation and a deep visual contact with a big magnetic explosion between the two. I look forward to the SEQUEL for this movie in 2004 and if you have ever seen this movie, you will feel the same way.
