What's with all the European reviews (especially England) here? All I have to say is that when I first saw this movie, when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course she's an idiot. That is the question. You have to see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come on, what did you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are a lot worse than that, and they were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors in them. For what it's worth, Men in White is a very funny mock from a movie. And with all the stupid and funny things that England has done in the last half century, I'm shocked by all the negative comments. We stupid Americans like our stupid mood. P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' for some laughs that Europeans will especially like.
