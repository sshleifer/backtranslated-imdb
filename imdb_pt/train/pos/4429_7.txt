I personally thought the movie was very good, very good acting by Tadanobu Asano of the fame of Ichi the Killer. I really can not say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a bit too much, and overall I thought the movie was too long. Other than that, however, the film contained great fights and many of the locations were beautifully filmed, great effects and a lot of spades. Another solid effort from Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I really can not tell you more about the movie, but if you're just looking at Asian cinema is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I suggest you try to rent it but if you're a die- I would say this has to be in your very good Japanese movie collection.
