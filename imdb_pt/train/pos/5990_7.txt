I do not have much to add to what was said before, but it's a lot of a movie of its time, and the first (and probably only) time when the studio hung the movie entirely on Dead End Kids. Warner gave a lot of help to the boys, from director Ray Enright and an 'A' budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. At each turn, we have one of those gem performances from real professionals. They are too many to list, but it seems like almost everyone on Warner's lot (Sans, the biggest stars) goes through this photo. (See if you can identify John Ridgely.) <br /> <br /> The only performance above is from the ever-reliable Eduardo Cianelli as a mob boss with a messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din". It's something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My proposal for this is a second feature on a double bill with something like "City for Conquest." <br /> <br /> Hooray for Warners!
