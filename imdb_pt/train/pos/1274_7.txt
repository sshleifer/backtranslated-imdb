Note that everyone who did not like and liked this movie commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and stories, movies have about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, sound and also the imagination. I do not care if a movie is as good as or, in fact, has some resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge for what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was lovely. An old, often seen, clich√©-prone story could easily have been embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves do that. One reviewer found Riffen far from old. I never would have guessed she was 40 when she made this movie. It's to her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old surprisingly well. I also think it's about the best thing Reeves has ever done. The story could have been stronger and I agree the screen could have used "squeeze". However, it is worth watching; clearly is not a powerful love story, but rather a charming novel that will make you satisfied that love is a strong and good emotion overcomes evil. And it's good to see a "love story" without the obligatory word f # $%, the bare buttocks or hours of exchange kisses to spit. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is excellent.
