I grew up in southern West Virginia; I am almost the same age (or perhaps a year older than) of Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", the book that forms the basis of the real story of this movie that warms the heart. <br /> <br /> And so I relate closely to the coal mining theme of West Virginia and the amazing effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. The Rocket Boys made great lives for themselves. I majored in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik has awakened many young people to the Science Gap that the US had in the US in those days of the Cold War ... This is a wonderful movie for all, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950's, it will touch the core of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Understand; note this; I recommend to your friends ... who will thank you often.
