"Who Loves The Sun" makes its way through some prickly subject with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious. It's been a while since I found such a touching, completely enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, drawing attention with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes. The peaceful image contrasts beautifully with the tension between the very human characters, very flawed and yet very friendly. Due to the excellent cast, all five great players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves The Sun." It's a very funny movie that takes a moving look at the hurts we can inflict on each other, and the incredibly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness.
