This was one of the most moving movies I have ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I first watched it and whenever it's on TV, my eyes are glued to it. the acting and the plot are incredible. seems so true to reality and touches on so many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
