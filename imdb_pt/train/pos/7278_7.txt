Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that grabs you and does not release until the end, especially when you see it as a child. Seeing the movie as an adult, you have to admit it's not really that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains many mysterious scenes (especially those with the creepy mummy). <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes of the film is undoubtedly the scene with Grandpa and Grandma in their new trailer; the scene with the rocks is very exciting and scary. Also the scenes in which the main character discovers the secret of his mother is quite scary. <br /> <br /> Okay, acting on the film is not that good and the movie sometimes seems a bit boring, but overall Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. Too bad that only a few people saw this movie, this movie really deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And to all of you Hollywood producers out there; If you want to redo a movie, redo this!
