Screwball comedy about romantic incompatibilities in New York. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture - he bows to them - but Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) placed a little above the others because, after all, she is the princess that Bogdanovich probably fell in love with in the movies 30 years before. He shoots loving close-ups, looks good on the sheets between her and a wonderfully cooked / boiled Ben Gazzara, and lets your room shine all over. The love connections made throughout the movie are quick and fun, although I got tired of John Ritter's lack of TV style. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and the terrified and sexy sensual Patti Hansen are thrilling to watch. But it's really Hepburn's Valentine's Day and she absolutely shines. *** in ****
