There is something special about the Austrian films not only from Seidl, but also from Spielmann and other directors. This is the pervasive sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the stories portrayed, but also by the actors who act. In Hundstage, I never had the feeling that these are actors playing, but real people. So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer ... Almost as if the grumpy retiree or the lonely lady in the movie were living below you in your block. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in Vienna can undoubtedly painfully recognize the people in the film with their meckern / sudern (complaining), their hidden sexual desires and the pro-male faces. This is further reinforced by the Viennese dialect, which is, according to many, especially made to claim as a way of life. A parochialism and arrogance typical of Vienna are also very well portrayed. <br /> <br /> The Viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the film with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens. In addition, they have been transformed into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and department stores. Among them are the homes of people where they indulge in what they consider to be pleasurable activities, trying to stay in touch with their human beings, though in vain. Examples are the old woman's sexual game with the men who bordered the rape, the progeny guy losing his temper and beating his girlfriend and the girl who hitchhikes and annoys her drivers. <br /> <br /> The film has no soundtrack as it focuses on the normality / abnormality of its images only. Another characteristic typical of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is his display of disturbing sex images. These include the stripping of the old woman to her husband, the sexual scenes in the bath, the sexual play of the lady with the two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage, Seild portrayed the lives of people who may eventually be both Viennese and citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. The spectators should not despise or feel sorry for the Viennese in the film, for they themselves can become victims of the same alienation and alienation, albeit in different circumstances. In the end, I believe that Seidl's film is a warning to us of the terrible state of human relations so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal.
