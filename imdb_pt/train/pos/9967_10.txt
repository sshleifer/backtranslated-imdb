There are some things I will never understand; Why underwear comes in packs of three, when clearly this is not enough. In the same way, I will never understand this movie, and this is brilliant. If you approach this movie expecting a real movie, you may be approaching Satan waiting for a hug; although this may be possible if you compliment the satanic figures of this film. Take Pitch, for example; The most ineffective, camp-portrait of an unblellish demon since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a 10-foot costume of Satan from red body paint and antlers covered with condoms. However, it creates some of the most hilarious moments of any movie of all time. Seriously, this is not understatement. The same can be applied to all other characters, barring the little girl who acts so innocent who is probably overcompensating for some serious crime of which she is a part. So again, if Santa's inter-space recognition station is real, there's no way she could have avoided it for so long. Put simply, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a serious aficionado. The painfully funny characterization, acting, concept and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any movie to date (if you are after pure laughter that is).
