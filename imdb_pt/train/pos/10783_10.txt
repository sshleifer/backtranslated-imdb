I liked this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith for years and he fit that role perfectly. I've linked him to comedy, but I'm glad to see he's versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of phobias and neuroses, and these can take on a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. It is clearly sensitive to extrasensory powers, as understood by local Indians, but not by any Anglo-Saxon. Not surprisingly, this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although this is considered a lightweight "family movie", it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. In addition, Hiram's turnaround at the end was a pleasant surprise for me and tied all the previous action into one package. It's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
