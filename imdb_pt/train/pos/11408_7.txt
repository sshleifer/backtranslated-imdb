Etienne Girardot is just an actor - the kind of person people would almost never know by name. However, he once again plays the coroner - one of the only actors in the films of Philo Vance who played his part more than once. I've seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was very funny and a breath of fresh air. This movie is also great to watch, because in addition to Girardot, there are many other wonderful characters for the ride - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a rather impressive cast, and they certainly made the job easier to lead the man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great actors are one of the big reasons why I love these old movies B. Although the mystery itself is rarely fantastic, because of vivid writing and acting, the movies really do. As for this film, Vance is touched wonderfully by Lowe, but as I said, the mystery itself is just a later thought - with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize someone to do anything of the sort - I have training in clinical hypnosis and if I could do something like the bad guy could do in the movie, I would have done it! Used car salesmen and some of my former bosses would have been obvious targets !! <br /> <br /> Overall, although not the best Philo Vance movie, it was very good and it's a shame that Lowe has played this role only once. In fact, in addition to William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hampered by a long, long succession of actors like Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. This is a similar problem that also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series - just many different actors playing the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing and exciting - though also quite impossible.
