Depardieu's most famous film is this (1974) groundbreaker by Bertrand Blier. He features many highly sexual scenes bordering an X-rating, including one by Jeanne Moreau making a hot 1970s version of his Jules and Jim menage a trois with the two furry French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no sacred territory in this film; everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that the Americans do not like this film very much, whereas many Frenchmen I know consider it a classic. Something about it goes against what Americans have been programmed to 'like'. <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two idiot bums with a lot of sexual insecurities, who run around abusing women and committing petty crimes. . They are off by kicks and anti-capitalist, Euro-commie, slacker 'freedom'. Blier satirizes the hell of these two guys and, at the same time, makes bourgeois society itself look much more ridiculous. Best of all is the way the wonderful score by Stephane Grappelli conveys the restless soul of vagabonds, the deeper subconscious perception or the "higher ideal" that motivates all the follies they practice.
