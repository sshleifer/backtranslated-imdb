This is one type of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol look very handsome. Soha remembers her mother, Sharmila Tagore very much. Abhay is a born actor and will grow a lot in the near future. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film is very different from most films. In a way you get dissatisfied, but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie. Otherwise it would have been a gross injustice to all. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a professional witness who is faced with a girl waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness. Slowly slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is unclear whether she has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for complete details. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more of his films. Soha is beautiful, but did not say much in the movie. His eyes, his innocence did most of the talking.
