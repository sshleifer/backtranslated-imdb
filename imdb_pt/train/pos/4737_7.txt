Hak Hap (Black Mask) is what I would call ballet with fists and explosions. Of course the plot has been tried and heard before, (a biologically engineered soldier who is part of a super-elite elite force who decides to feel that killing and brute force are not the ways to solve everything and become a pacifist, and a But when he discovers that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking over the police - his best friend is a police officer - he becomes the black mask.) The style the film looks for, , it works and at least for me it's fun. I love martial arts movies that are spectacular. People who fly lighter than air and recover a fraction of a second after impact, keep pace and action on and on. But this is how this movie is, right, a demonstration of Jet Li doing what he does best, and this is a spectacular showmanship of his skills, which to say the least are top notch. As with most fast-acting martial arts movies wing. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are now showing up here in the states for the first time, these films are low-key and high in amazing physical feats. But I must say, even with the large holes left in the plot (how can we see him safe in his apartment when only one scene before he had 20 men who are no more than 15 feet from him with escape signal? scene just cuts to him in the apartment ....... ohh well suspension of the belief I think), the film for me gets interesting. It's only up to the last 20 minutes that the movie seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter. But still all around a great action movie.
