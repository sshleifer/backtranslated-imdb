The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - primarily an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, his sisters, and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is funny, poignant and thought-provoking. This led me to reevaluate my own relationship with my now deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been better chosen. I hope both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will be recognized at next year's film awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
