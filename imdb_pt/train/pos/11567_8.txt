In the 1930s, studios used short films like this as a testing ground for new actors, given their relative ease of production compared to feature films, so it is interesting that this film stars Shirley Temple, who had established there long herself as the most famous child star of all time. So again, it was probably not the one being tested, I imagine it would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirley's brother Sonny in the film and made a comparatively less impressive performance. Then again, a 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to follow. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an expressionless vision that involves a flat ceiling, which I suppose was designed to have Shirley Temple. take a scornful look at the ceiling, illustrate the status of the family's working class in the film, and provide a neat transition to the next scene, which will show Shirley treading in the rain happily. <br /> It's Sonny. y birthday, and his father makes occasional and terribly ill-made efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog that he really wants for himself but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten for once and was scared Since. It is curious that when his father insists on getting a dog, Sonny decides to run away from home instead of having a dog at home, and as he is running away with no fate in sight, it is also curious that the film illustrates what appears to be an indifference for the homeless that surpasses even the amazing indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron frying pan next to the train tracks (just after a train has flown). , given how close to the tracks he was, you'd think he'd have blown the guy right off the rails, but it does not matter). After Sonny gives up sharing the breakfast due to the sour look his cheerful smile receives from the guy, he continues and the homeless person disappears from the movie. It is interesting to consider what a longer film would have done, because it leaves this poor man as a loose end. <br /> <br /> Not that it matters, Sonny soon hears a dog whining under an easel as it passes over. and jump to find a burrowed dog. It may seem banal that he immediately takes the dog and adopts since he left the house because of his fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he only needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs, but of his lack of power over he. As soon as he saw a dog in need, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's enough, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I'm done! <br /> <br /> It's a very convenient movie in which everything works exactly as it should, but it's cute and nice enough (and short enough, so to speak) to remain a fun movie. We no longer expect an epic plot in a 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still has a substantial amount of story and character development in its short runtime. And also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert on the Shirley Temple movies, but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous children's star of all time.
