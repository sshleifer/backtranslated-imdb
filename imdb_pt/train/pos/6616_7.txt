This is a movie that I decided to go and see because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when a film does not develop around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be seen as a work of art, rather than showing the actors' ability to differentiate their styles. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly more about style than about history. While I found the story interesting (a thriller that lends history and atmosphere to films like Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was a bit difficult to follow at times, and it did not seem like everything came together as well as could have. He definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together. Whether this is a good thing or not is up to the viewer. Visually, this film is a treat for the eyes and, in that sense, a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation, or would like to see a movie different from most movies right now. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the experience of the movie, but I was a bit disappointed because it could have been better
