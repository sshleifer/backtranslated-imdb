Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the show 'South Park', return with something totally different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as basketball. It's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are wrapped and there's another letter and the title. Here's how you play: you just throw the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot. It seems simple. I could try one day. After the game hits the streets, it soon becomes a huge success. Who would know that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that has become so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very crude and silly parody full of clown violence, yet it delivers a few laughs and lots of entertainment. A definite recommendation for those of you who enjoy slapstick and coarse humor.
