What a good movie! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns. James Belushi is very good as a former dictator who stole 12 million from the boss who has to fend off gangsters, his wife's backwoods, and the local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, jump on board and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10
