Radio was not a week of 7 days a week happening when I grew up in the 1930s in England, so Kids' Hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and a spare battery for power. The few programs I've heard, therefore, made a big impression on my young mind, and the 3 that I still remember are "Toytown," one about all the animals in the zoo, and --- Gray Owl, talking about animals that he knew, that he called his "brothers." It was only recently that I learned that the gray owl was not genuinely "Indian," but the tribute paid by the Sioux chief makes a lot of sense to me "a man becomes what he dreams of." Could we all dream as world changing and beneficial as Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Could a new gray owl influence global leaders to clean the environment.
