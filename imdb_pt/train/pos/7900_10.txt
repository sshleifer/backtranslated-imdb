I admit, the first time I saw Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I do not think it was very memorable in any regard. But now, after seeing him for the seventh time, I admit that this has grown a lot in me. The characters of Sissy, Ms. Jellybean, and Countess were very kind. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I find satirical humor more than makes up for it. Then there's the kick-ass soundtrack that features K.D. tremendously talented. Lang (which reminds me a little of Patsy Cline) at their best. I can not think of any movies that have "grown on me" after a first unfavorable impression, as much as Cowgirls.
