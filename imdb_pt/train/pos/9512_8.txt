This is a movie that may make you want to see it again. I especially liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not surprised for the first time, it is suspected he will be back. <br /> <br /> The story is thrilling and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was needed for it. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that Michael Jr. could be seemingly as indifferent as his younger brother and his mother, who were impressed. But, I can appreciate that the scene could not really get our attention there because it had a bigger story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe this is not justified. If his character was more difficult, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I only saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
