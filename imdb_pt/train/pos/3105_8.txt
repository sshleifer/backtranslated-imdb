The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final ride of super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is about to kill the people who turned him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the most respected trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has a 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning its status is "universal acclaim" and for good reason - the fight is choreographed very well and the deep story can be <br /> <br /> First, I recommend you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two Ultimatum prequels, under the fantasy name. There may be three different films, but in reality they are all one continuation from one to the other: the lack of one leaves you stuck and confused as I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of the Ultimatum if you missed the first two but then the story will definitely lead <br /> If you were lucky enough to see the prequels for this movie, you probably had a treatment watching Bourne shoot down your enemies and track down the man who screwed you up from Supremacy. Bourne Bourne is played very well by Mat t? Damon: Damon does not do anything to deserve an Oscar nod. Your work here is good enough to sustain. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to prevent the film from becoming bland at times. The Bourne monitoring agency takes advantage of all the technological tools known to mankind to track it. <br /> <br /> I will not go into detail about the characters because they are sequels to the first two films. However, it would not hurt the film to spell out some things for the public - not every viewer is an obstinate observer who can understand every little hint about the development of the story. The Ultimatum would not have been harmed had the story been a little more direct. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a movie: the movie opened for $ 69 million, and - the box office total is now up to $ 216,000 - currently , is still doing very well for a movie that has been in theaters since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> /> Good) Damon is solid, but not spectacular, very clever Bad movie) History is like many others
