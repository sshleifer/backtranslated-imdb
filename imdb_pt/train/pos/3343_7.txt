My daughter is really hurt when I refer to Drew Barrymore as if she had been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention Jay Leno's chin, in which Dudley Dooright would die. How wonderful, then, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I really like Ms. Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is probably best characterized as a sweet and light comedy. To be absolutely stereotyped, the girls will love the movie because of its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will like the whole male bond and the sporty mania. <br /> <br /> My hatred of the sport wife, my teenage daughter and I found something to like in the movie. That says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half, and it's probably a good date too.
