A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of terror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is something negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story, it may be that the special effects seemed dated in comparison to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector has to stand in an isolated area while trying to collect a debt. Of course he is also haunted. <br /> <br /> What I did not expect the first time I saw this movie is that it's one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen; that is, without losing the slapstick comedy that will leave you in spots. Unlike some Asian cinema films, A Chinese Ghost Story is not difficult to swallow for those who are not versed in Chinese culture. In fact, it touches on timeless themes and without paranormal culture and romance. <br /> <br /> Think of Evil Dead 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. This movie is real, despite being overlooked by many. It is absolutely one of the best I have ever seen. It is the ability to combine the best aspects of various genres and cross cultural boundaries to attract humanity everywhere, it is nothing short of fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
