"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen, period. Of course, it's a low budget, but it's a comedic tour de force non-stop. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when her future father-in-law asks how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'll get between $ 30,000 and $ 1,000,000 a year, sir." Of course, it's the Candy delivery he sells. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns into a hilarious performance as a despicable filmmaker. A clip of your horrible low budget movie "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So if you're a fan of Candy and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie enough.
