This is a great movie. If this is an indication, then Hong Sang-Soo is actually the "best kept secret of Asian cinema". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers much of the same theme as them thematically, but I think I really appreciate it more as a whole than any of his films. The obvious minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in his work, although it still fits completely in this style (the camera never moves once), and somehow I found the film less "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao-hsien, which I think is part of the reason I liked it the most. Besides, he does not keep his affairs as separate as the Hou. I felt that the film was somehow more "complete" and less open (just a little) than some of its work, though that does not mean it has something like a progressive plot. I would have difficulty believing that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this movie for "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman wandering alone, and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can not but seem familiar).
