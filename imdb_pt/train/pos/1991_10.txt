Yes, unbelievable, in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for Best Picture - and it was the third musical to win the award in five years, being the first My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound. of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver! is immensely better! Without comparison. The first two movies are wet tasteless noodles compared to the robust Oliver!. The acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dance is great. This film is dynamic, current, relevant to the human experience and, unlike New York's exaggerated gangsters, Oliver! offers a picture of poverty in 19th century London in England that evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves this in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portraits of characters who evoke sympathy and affection without being caricatures.
