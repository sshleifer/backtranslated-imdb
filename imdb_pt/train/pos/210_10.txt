Two great comedians in a great Neil Simon movie based on their success. <br /> <br /> Excellent combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won an Oscar for it; He's as sharp and funny as ever. And Matthau is your partner, if you're a little more eccentric. <br /> <br /> This is Simon's familiar territory: two old vaudeville partners get together for a TV special, but they still can not stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a delight to see these two choose one another, their scenes together make this film an absolute pleasure. I especially liked the "hitting, hitting, hitting / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a Burns or Matthau fan, you'll enjoy it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, you're going to enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put some "sunshine" into your life.
