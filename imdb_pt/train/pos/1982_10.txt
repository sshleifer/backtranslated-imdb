This was my favorite movie as a child, and I've been in the stage production a few times, so it will always remain my favorite musical and I doubt anyone can redo the story of Oliver Twist on screen, better than this one of my all time favorite '' bad guy '' has to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. It not only scared my life when I watched it when I was 6 but now as a woman I can have more empathy with the character Nancys, the barmaid / prostitute who helps Oliver to have the life he deserves. Jack Wilde as the tricky cheater was fantastic, and I do not think anyone could beat him, like the pocket-sized picker, and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, I'm also grateful they did not give Bill Sikes a musical number, that would not work with him being such a sinister character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job with Nancy's sticky ending, keeping him at the movies, disguising her spanking, but donating enough to show Bill's violence to her. <br /> <br /> This film is charming and charismatic as a musical song, as well as being a moving drama that accompanies a boy as he tries to find his position in life.
