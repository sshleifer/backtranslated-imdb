What I like about you is one of those series that you need to see but not sure what you would see, the beginning is cool and this sucks you in the series just for fun, the second part in season 2-3 that are older, they come and go at what you want. what happens with many series is that they do not end with something special because the second part of the series always goes to the drain, this one also did a little, the third part is the one that spoils and spoils the whole series, usually, but this does not happens, this end is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, in fact I was very angry with all these guys in Val's life, actually I wanted to end with Jeff in the end, but later that changed, they chose to take Vic to the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series stand on top. <br /> <br /> see you often the series is really cool I hope the second part is so good that it is not but the third party does what was necessary and made the series to one that was worth it the whole thing, I'm happy to say that I was happy and happy with the series and now I'm going to see two guys, a girl and a pizzeria, when I've seen the whole series, I'll be back ...
