This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to pick up a young eagle. the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and flee from the tribe. The eagle helps to feed him by taking a duck from a small lake that the boy scares. Later, the boy shoots at a deer that a bully boy was complaining because his arrows were marked very close to it. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines determine who actually got the deer. But this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even more cruel with him, and in the end he is being chased on a cliff but when you think he will fall out of his pure love for the eagle turns him into a golden eagle with only one paste it as a reminder of who he was. Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I have not seen him for over 30 years, but I still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com. with
