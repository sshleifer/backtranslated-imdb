but I want to say that I can not agree more with Moira. What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about this this morning, wanting to give advice to some sod dopey that had lost money on their debit card through fraud, and wanted to say "Keep your money in your pocket" and realized that I was talking like James Mason. <br /> <br /> Even so he did not say those words I still think he would! I never forgot "Are you carrying it?" in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "There's always money in your pocket!" Good advices. <br /> <br /> It is not enough for children to have parents with such ruthless, but well-intentioned attitudes. Or any father at all. <br /> <br /> It would be good for us to re-establish 'ti', 'tu' and 'tu' in our language to show that we care. It's just the same as 'tutoyer' in French or 'du' in German. <br /> <br /> Addendum: I just realized that many of my observations were about James Mason in The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think it's because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> I hold the comments. <br /> <br /> And spring and Port wine are very similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days, you really had something to say and talk about later, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theatrical experiences are almost real. and they are important to helping young people grow. <br /> <br /> It does not happen now, I think, that teens can just go to the pictures like we did.
