This is one of the greatest children's films ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow screaming "Wait, wait for me, Peter!" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best movie ever! The movie lines are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; "The rule of the cat and the dogs drool!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I loved that line. The plot may seem strange to some, but I like it. Shadow like the older dog that is preparing the Chance to take control when it's gone, it's really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood puppy. I think everyone can find a piece of them in "Homeward Bound".
