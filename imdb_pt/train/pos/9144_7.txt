Ok, so it may not be the award-winning movie "movie of the year" (plus the brilliant soundtrack I think has won a few awards), but it's a great movie about 'The Kid' (Prince / O ) and the events around him that live in Minneapolis, playing his music. The song is absolutely superb, in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack, it is truly a classic and sums up the eighty sounds and feel in one AND the film in if it's a great plot, it's worth seeing several times, especially if you like Prince / O (which I do), of course.
