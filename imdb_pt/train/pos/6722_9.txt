Everyone has commented on cinematography (from good to great), personalities (bigger than life), structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture over time). What is missing is a major question of sociological importance: to eliminate American culture for something more rewarding and gratifying. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm movies at SoCal's local schools. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day long until my skin radiated heat, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and watching the latest surfing movie at night. Often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script on sheets of paper. Sometimes a surf or proto-punk band added music. I've never been happier. Except for the jokes and screams, watching 'Riding Giants' took me back in time. <br /> <br /> It also reinforced the feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about money and with social and corporate escalation. ladder, not following the Joneses, pushing physically and mentally into a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, "What is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest enough with ourselves to pursue: living life on our own terms alone. Maybe society would collapse if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see people who are really living their dreams. <br /> <br /> It was this message that really impressed me.
