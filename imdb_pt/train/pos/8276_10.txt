Now that's what I'm talking about. Finally, a low budget horror ride that uses its limitations to your advantage. WENDIGO, though occasionally flawed, is a triumph of the imagination. Granted, it tilts heavy on EVIL DEAD style camera moves for its moodiness, but it's still a curse vision better than 99% from direct to video slag. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple: a family takes a vacation in a remote hut and are threatened by a particularly unbalanced hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to create suspense and add layers of disturbing strangeness through the use of the mythical Wendigo. It's real? Is everything in the boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some have argued that the movie is unsatisfying because it is left for you to decide. Do not get discouraged by this insignificant nonsense. A movie that makes you think is not one to avoid. It is one to rejoice.
