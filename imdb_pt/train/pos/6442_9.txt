It's an excellent Swedish film .. it was the first Swedish film I saw .. it's simple and deep .. what a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist made a great show as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great as her inspirational girlfriend to help him continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> The fight between the maestro and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends the noble cause of Michael to help his hometown to find his own peace in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the end. .. it was not so good, but it has some deep meaning.
