The paradoxes of time are the devil's trap for underemployed minds. They are fun to consider in a 'what if?' kind of way. Filmmakers and authors have dealt with it repeatedly in a number of films and television, including 'Star Trek: First Contact', Bill and Ted's trilogy 'Back to the Future', 'Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and Stargate SG1 homage, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's "All You Zombies" was written decades ago and yet it will still attract people reading this tale for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent "12 Monkeys," it is difficult to establish what may be continuity issues versus plot elements intended to rethink our conception of the film. Repeated visions will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the movie for the first time, will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as "the continual painful experience" entrusted to him by the time travel. <br /> <br /> Unlike other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' it is not clear whether future history can be altered by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time can not be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he was sent back to 1996 on his own timeline. > <br /> Even this could be interpreted as an event that had to happen in a single universe of time, in order to ensure that the timeline was not changed ... Cole has to die before the eyes of his son more new. the destination to be performed. If that is the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces that work on it. It confuses the mind to dwell on this kind of thing too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plan at the end of the movie, then it means that the future CAN be altered by the manipulation of past events ... or not? The film probably led to many drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> The bonus material of the DVD allows a very interesting view. Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film under budget, which is not a particular surprise after the Munchausen disaster and in light of his later attempt to film "Don Quixote." I would rate the documentary 'making of' as one of the most interesting I have ever seen. It is certainly not a whitewashed one and accurately observes the occasional difficulties and conflicts that arise among the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as its "7 Â½" release, because the film is written by writers other than himself - and therefore not really "his" movie "" does not do justice to the film itself. Brad Pitt's portrait of Goines is curiously engrossing, though his character is not particularly sympathetic. Stay tuned for his wide-eyed gaze at one of the asylum scenes. It is disturbing and disturbing. Probably a coincidence, Louis Armstrong's' What a Wonderful World 'song was used at the end of '12 Monkeys' and in the final episode of the TV series' The Hitchhiker'. Guide to the galaxy '. Both the film and the TV series also featured British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess can entertain. It's not an irrational recreation, that's for sure.
