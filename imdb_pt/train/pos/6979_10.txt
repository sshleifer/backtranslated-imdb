This is a real drama, based on characters and stories, on a level that shames most of what we see on TV at the beginning. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the start. Do not be discouraged if yours is not a sci fi nut (like me ...) This could be happening on earth, the fact that your in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no spaceships or laser cannons (Anyway, until now) So far I've seen until 1:04 and I'm stuck and wondering what's going to happen next, since there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The cast plays there roles with passion. Eric stoltz is especially strong. <br /> <br /> This show really is fine, no matter if you watched BSG or not, in fact they are quite different. I read some negative comments from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and lightning weapons etc, but I'd say ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a very positive start to a show. Let's hope they do not get it after 1 or 2 seasons as they usually do with good shows these days.
