A great, funny, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while researching a potential independent film. I was a little dubious about the movie in the first ten minutes, but as soon as it entered the store I started to like the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It contains no complex plot and is easy to follow, but it eliminates the saddest mood and makes you smile to the end without the need for an insignificant clich√© novel. It includes several scenes all the way that make you squeeze your sides with laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
