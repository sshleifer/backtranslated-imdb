Just as the new BSG was not what fans of the original series were hoping for, Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG were expecting (most of the time). It's a very interesting show, if not a little self-involved, or at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the great CGI emotions of the (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you liked the drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify yourself with. <br /> <br /> The plot examines how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. . Writers also deal with humans playing God (s) and the creation or recreation of human life. It will be interesting to see how this unfolds. <br /> <br /> I found it flowing in some parts and preaching in others, but overall it was promising. A small part of me wants (or expects) that there might be some little BSG statements there (besides the story I mentioned), but that would probably wrap the plot too much. As BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me, but it's too early to tell. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to consider this a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but I'm willing to give it a try. Overall, I found it interesting enough to make me see how the current series is before 'throwing in the towel (proverbial)'.
