this film is a masterpiece of a young woman's story during the war, and it really happens, not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed by this movie, the acting and the story I like the movie, because it is a true story, it is Giff feel me there and feel sorry for the dean that Maruschka Detmers is playing because whoever wants to end life this way. I recommend that everyone has to see this movie, especially the younger ones and to learn something with this movie. This movie you can compare with the movie soldier orange or any real story that happened in WW2.
