Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film is a somber, surreal look at the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers, essentially a series of vignettes depicting various groups of people living dangerously in a hard and indifferent favela of post- war. . Moving from comedy to tragedy and backward, this movie shows how people deal with the worst kind of life their way, especially withdrawing into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads, withdrawing emotionally from the who are around you or drowning in alcohol. Blending the realism of the kitchen sink with Kabuki's theatricality, Kurosawa cleverly plays with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughter with equal dexterity. A wonderful and draining experience.
