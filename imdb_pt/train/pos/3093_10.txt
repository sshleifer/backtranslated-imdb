Why did the producers not give the show a chance? Of all the junk on the TV, why did the producers not give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I'd love to see how it ends. Put the first season on video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for his return. I set up my recorder to record all shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and I'm heartbroken. I would like to know that this would be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters. The writing was very good too. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my all time favorite. I'm so sorry for that!
