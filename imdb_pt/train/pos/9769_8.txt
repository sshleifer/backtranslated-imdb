I liked. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. I read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling stressed or really dead, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed me to do that. That makes it a success in my eyes! I did not even go out to do anything else while I was running. Whether or not it was rated "good" or not, this is not really important to me. And no, I'm not juvenile. I'm not even an idiot.
