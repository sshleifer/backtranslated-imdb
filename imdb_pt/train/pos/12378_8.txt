In the hands of a more skilled director, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. Although Michael "Death Wish", merely a passable direction, the film is interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The script contains more than a clich√© of terror on its back (several can not shake) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her while she insists that strange things are happening. Burgess Meredith is charming as the madly insane neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting a young Beverly D'Angelo as her dumb and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a job on a chair. And stay tuned for a brief appearance by Chris Walken, unknown at the time! This movie is scary and creative. The plot twists are lovely, if a bit predictable. The climax, of which I will not give details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more with this, however, it is quite satisfactory - at least for those with the horror sensitivity of the seventies. <br /> <br /> If you like modern super-tale fantasy-torture, you've won that way. There is almost no blood. The direction is quite Spartan. The effects are few, although there is some delightful makeup near the end - most of which is not actually makeup ... but maybe I've already talked too much. <br /> <br /> I evaluated this a bit. higher than its quality may justify, but I liked it as much as any movie "8" I saw.
