Quite annoying that critics continue to compare this with Planet Earth ... Of course * Planet Earth is better - there is much more of it. The Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series and as such is inevitably understated and simplified. But that's not compare like with like. As a full-length feature film (or, in fact, a feature film), it surpasses practically anything you will see in your entire life (unless you choose to cross the Earth helicopters with long range cameras for years on end, and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on the planet, which - let's face it - is unlikely. <br /> In the narration: yes, everyone in the UK - including a lot of myself - adores David Attenborough, and there is little excuse for him not to be narrating here, but hardly deserves to overthrow a star or three. He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's modest and gracious enough to realize that anything that draws more viewers is a Good Thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by his admiration, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree on this. Those who love him (ie, all) will / must continue to see a planet Earth. So three cheers for your cinematic release and a great boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on DVD instead of the Planet Earth box. But as works of art, they do not compete with people. <br /> <br /> The Earth is large enough for both.
