This was the second entry in the regular series Columbo, and keeps well today. As I can see it up close now on DVD and see how it's built, I'm very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the beautiful MALE CALLAHAN as well as countless TV episodes) - note how the actions post-murder of the killer are shown in a split screen effect on his two glasses, observe how the murder itself is shown in assembled form, observe the viewpoint shot from the perspective of the corpse. In addition, the wild but impressive musical avant-garde of the famous musician Gil Melle was incredible and helped a lot to create an atmosphere. And the supporting performance of Brett Halsey as the golf pro was wonderful - such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional cut. The "formula" had not yet been defined when this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the highest quality actors and it is a pleasure to see them working - all men are familiar with many other roles and still get lost in their characters here. All in all, this entry into the Columbo series - and MANY of the others - is as well crafted as a great feature film.
