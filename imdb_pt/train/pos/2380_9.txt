I did not mind the whole walk. People really walked back then. He lent an air of authenticity to this play of the period and some perspective on the technology of the Martians. I was also disappointed with the effects, in particular the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most exciting of the book. But I can not praise this movie enough, for its fidelity to the Wells story! It was time. The actors are friendly and the performances are lovely. It is also worth seeing this movie just to hear the great soundtrack of Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London.
