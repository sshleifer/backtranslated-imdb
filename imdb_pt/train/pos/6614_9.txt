I read that this did not work out, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels he has failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. First, it is well executed. Volckman is doing well not only to try out a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking about: Would immortality reduce the value of life? Great question ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he is struggling to build a feeling, and he is not compromising. That should be applauded. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a way. I have seen artists reduce a form to the minimum to build the intensity of a moment. I identify this movie with that. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is far more interesting than Richard Linklater's rotoscope, and Volckman's story has more meaning than Linklater's later stories about a drug-wasted life. Old news. Everyone knows this, but nobody does anything about it. The Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many other stories out there with many holes that do a lot better. Well done, Volckman. Really good job.
