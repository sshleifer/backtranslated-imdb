One thing is for sure ... you should not watch this movie if you're having a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he can not cope with. The story is passed on to you instead of the stupid explanation so that you're wondering what's going on. Eventually, the points are united and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many moral issues need to be asked, but if you simply accept and buy your agony, then it is easier. to accept what he chose to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey you take is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good movie that unfortunately leaves you a little sad in the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the kind in which you have to think and not just watch the explosions and fights.
