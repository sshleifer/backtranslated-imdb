******** Spoilers - Beware ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have been watching it countless times - and I've usually discovered something new about it with each view. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people not rich people living in LA or New York. Well, it's true, except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small Texas town who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And that's where Travolta really played in some good drama films, like Saturday Night Fever, instead of playing stereotypical bandits / good guys in big-budget movies. This is a very good movie - the mechanical bull riding championship and two-step dance can be silly, but you have to take that into account for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with shining slut) - and soon after, they are married and live in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real-life battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove that he is a real man? He can work his dangerous work during the day and ride the mechanical bull at night - he can be an "urban cowboy." But Sissy wants to drive her pick-up, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull as well. So where does that leave Bud? As Sissy claims her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-convict and prison rodeo star - a real bull pilot -, Wes (played wonderfully greasy by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy separate. Sissy talks to Wes, who abuses her. Even more empathizing, Bud becomes Pam's boy toy, a rich girl whose father is in oil and all that implies. Sissy comes by the trailer to clean it - Pam does not do that sort of thing. She writes a make-up letter to Bud, but the evil Pam rips her off and takes credit for Sissy's household chores. Buddy's Uncle Bob tragically dies at work when he strikes a lightning bolt and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance for reconciliation, but they are very stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull riding competition is at Gilley's, and you know Bud will win. Pam notices Bud does not love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes tries to steal Gilleys, but you do not know that the urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and wins back the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course, you may wonder why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs." Maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. Or because Bud did not stay with Pam - she was not that bad and had money. Or why did they have to kill Uncle Bob? Or because Bud and Sissy had stupid friends like Marshall and Jessie, who always tried to separate them: Marshall tells Bud: "She {Sissy} rides the bull better than you!" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is a little bit of ridicule - and to say, it's not Bonnie Raitt on stage!
