I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was dam Funny! When I first saw that I was playing on ETV (Estonian Television) And I started to like it. Too bad this show is bad at me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And it comes in foolish ideas. He got those glasses that are brown. I like it . And there's Fez. The Perverted group. We all know what he does when only he ..... He wants to fuck badly. He even had with his boss in one episode. He's from India. And there's Michael, the stupidest guy in the whole gang, probably the dumbest in town and his cop! He's so stupid I remember to follow: Hyde says: Did you call cops? - No Michael comes in and says. Anyone know how to turn the siren off? He's a playboy in town. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's ex-girlfriend and then she is Hyde's girlfriend. So, Eric is the son of a grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty, the housewife. Its a great pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan for the wedding. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm what I forgot? ah Hyde lives in a basement.
