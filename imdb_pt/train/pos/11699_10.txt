I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's amazing. But the only thing with that was that in the beginning, there was a lot of talk about who was dating whom. I think it would be interesting to do a remake of it. But on the official website, they said they will not make a remake because many people were saved by viewing it. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She's a great actress. She did several other films in the '70s and' 80s, but we have not heard from her since. I know for sure about Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for bookkeeping at RD Films. But overall, I have to say that the series itself is like Left Behind gone from old school.
