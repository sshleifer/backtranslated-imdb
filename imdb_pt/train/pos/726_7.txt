Vince Lombardi High School has a new director - the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She plans to ban rock and roll all together. She beats head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not connect with any girl - not realizing that the cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> An instant midnight movie. This was put on general release and almost immediately bombed - but as a midnight movie was a huge success and continued playing throughout the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college - it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing loudly at every joke and usually just having fun. <br /> <br /> Seeing this now as an adult I can not imagine why I loved it so much. The script is youthful and full of groans that I could not believe I was listening to. The characters change at random and the movie jumps all over the place. What saves this are some really funny lines and wonderful performances from Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY amused). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles exaggeratedly (as they should). As for the Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I like the title song, but the rest of the songs never really got me. If you are a fan of Ramones, you can give a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) which will probably find it silly but fun. I particularly think they will like the end when the college is destroyed! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for a midnight movie from the 1980s, you might like that. Otherwise, stay away. I give a 7.
