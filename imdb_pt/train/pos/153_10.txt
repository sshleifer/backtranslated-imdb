This film is, in short, a cinematographic masterpiece. The film is moved brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film begins during the Spanish Civil War, when a group of children takes revenge of another child. In fact, they are acting in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later, we find three of these children again as adults in a sanitarium. Here we see what life has produced in each of them. One is a sexually repressed inmate patient. Another man is a drug dealer who got sick. The third son, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving in the sanitarium. This film is an allegory on the effect of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This movie has a climax that is definitely not for the most sensitive members of the audience, but it is logical and also deeply moving. The acting is excellent and the script is well written. There is a musical score that provides a dreary trend throughout this film. This is not a movie for those who like excitement, but a movie for an attentive audience.
