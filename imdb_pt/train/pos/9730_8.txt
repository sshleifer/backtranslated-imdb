UK newspaper reviews seem to have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to meet Toby Young, the journalist on whose real-life experiences this film is based. The key word here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictional romcom. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York where he goes on to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and doing it. This involves selling the film, and the film has some important points about journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance remains a comedy that revolves around the misadventures of Sidney. The script takes its cake and eats it in which Sidney is a stupid and well-meaning clown, while at the same time being a skilful, moderately obnoxious writer. This contradiction is never such a problem, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects sympathy very well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges disparages Sidney's editor with a bit of efficiency, and Kirsten Dunst is quite anonymous as the eventuality in conflict. Object of Sidney's affection And, as far as Megan Fox (who plays a bimbo airhead star) is concerned, I can only say this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I'm going to leave my wife, sell all my belongings and buy a plane ticket in order to take my place at his side as his consort. Of course, since I'm a 56-year-old fat English accountant, you may not find my offer too attractive, but you're on the table anyway. Given how short her career has been so far, one might think that it is too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role that mercilessly satirizes the kind of actress she can be thought to become: however, she does sweetly with some skill and extremely sexy. This girl goes far. <br /> <br /> There is strong support from many experienced artists - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the USA. <br /> <br /> There are several moments of laughter, and I smile almost all the time. As always, the word F makes appearances when you do not really need it, although at least some of them are very funny.
