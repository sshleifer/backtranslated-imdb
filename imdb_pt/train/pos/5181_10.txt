I liked this movie overall, but four things really stand out: Sam Raimi's perfect comedic timing and his performance as the camp man, Alan Arkin's wonderful characterization of the camp owner, and best of all, cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of the outer scenes draw me to the movie as a sunset on the lake shore draws me to my own summer memories. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and humor seem very natural and believable. Some critics criticize the lack of a "deeper" script. For me, it's exactly this fault that makes this movie work. The characters and their problems seem real, and because of that, I worry about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The result is that all parties come together to create a whole that feels right.
