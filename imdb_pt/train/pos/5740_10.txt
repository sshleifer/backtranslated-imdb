The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things Hollywood does not do anymore. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and heartfelt films I have ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis do Oscar Winning! There are not enough words to express how great this movie is. Of course, people who do not like sentimental movies may not care so much about the rest of us about Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this film goes straight to the heart and outpost of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, ALWAYS! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS BELOW ***** <br /> <br /> The simple but eloquent story is masterfully told. Eugene is a medical trainee who faces long hours and a demanding workload at the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and clumsy because of brain damage due to a victim of abuse by his father. (A touching moment when this is discovered in the movie that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (aka "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide if he wants to finish medical school, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick (or Nicky), or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay for his brother's tuition, working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> The issues of ethics, morals and responsibilities are masterfully mixed in this historical film. Just when Gino thinks Nicky may be progressing toward independence, Dominick turns around and ends up doing things like helping a drug dealer or trying to use a faulty cable he finds in the trash can of an appliance. <br /> <Larry, is "The Character" and Nicky's partner in his garbage route that fills Dominick's naive head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, whom he's teaching in Clinical Pharmacology ) going to Atlantic City and throwing away all your money. But deep down, you can see Larry cares about him. In his rounds, Nicky also befriends a boy, whom we discover was also beaten by his father. A final result is also tragic and the pain you see on Nicky's face when it happens speaks a lot. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share for each other can not be exaggerated enough. All Nicky wants to do is be loved and seek acceptance in any way he can. (eg he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can your brother become independent enough that Geno can pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have received far more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately came about at the same time as Rain Man, who dealt with a similar problem. However, I like Dominick and Eugene more because they have a much stronger emotional component. Be warned that this film is directed to the tear ducts, so have Kleenex on hand! What movie !!!!
