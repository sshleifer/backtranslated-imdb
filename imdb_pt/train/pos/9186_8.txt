The troubled male magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has terrible nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies begin to appear dead indeed, Adrien worries that he can be the killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman relates the engaging story at a steady pace, builds a reasonable amount of tension, offers some crudely effective moments of savage misogynist violence (a woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake on it over her head rates as the definitive squirrel-inducing highlight), puts a refreshing emphasis on well-designed and engaging characters, as well as grounding everything in a plausible everyday world, and outdoes things with a good bunch of hot, feminine nudity. The good acting of an excellent cast helps a lot: Joanna Pettet as the lovely and lovable passionate Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's amputee twin brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as Adrien's psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter such as Adrien's ugly gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as gritty homicide detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a tough cop, and Misty Rowe as the sweet, bubbly Bambi model. The polished cinematography of R. Michael Stringer makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial photos. Jack Goga's ominous score also does the trick. Appearing in cooler parts are Robert Tessier as a rude bartender, Sally Kirkland as a cheeky prostitute, Kathy Shower as a fierce B.J. wrestler in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her normal roles as an old woman. A solid and nice image.
