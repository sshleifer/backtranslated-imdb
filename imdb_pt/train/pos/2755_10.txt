When I first saw this movie, I thought it was the typical "love your neighbor" stuff .... The more the movie was going on, the more I got involved. Acting is magnificent from both actors, the direction was great, the story unusual. I cried my eyes for the first time in my life for a movie. A real must have in any serious videoteque. 11 out of 10
