While "I.Q" by Fred Schepisi does not really have important qualities, it is still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton's doctoral candidate in mathematics, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously, little is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It is not intended for anything except a light comedy, unlike Robbins' most famous 1994 movie (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's entire life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements but also on his political activism, that is, how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons the FBI kept a file on it). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
