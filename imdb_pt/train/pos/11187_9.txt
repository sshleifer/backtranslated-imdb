Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage and a daughter, Ellen. They are received with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89, and could basically tell about the whole story of Ludlow. Behind the new home of the Creed, there is a path leading to a pet graveyard (spelled as a semester). When Ellen wants to go upstairs to see, Jud voluntarily takes the family for a trip. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids leave, Ellen's cat church dies. Jud feels that Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests that Louis follow him further through the pet graveyard. <br /> <br /> Jud tells Louis about this cemetery once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries the Church without Jud's help. A couple of days later, the Church returns, alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This film was one of the two horror movies that really scared me, plus "The Exorcist." The best performance would be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the Creeds make the mistake of bringing things back from the dead. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie film plays an extravagant part. It is both sad and mysterious. Go along with the movie wonderfully. <br /> <br /> 9/10
