This is a very dark, harsh and even brutal movie about a break in the death row that goes awry. Black and white photography prevents it from being dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as twisted lead, but strangely friendly. One of the first films to depict the psychological desolation of death row. It's also quite moving.
