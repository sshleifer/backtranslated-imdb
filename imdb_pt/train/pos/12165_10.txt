Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing loudly at the wrong time; and the moment you realize you should not be laughing, you've reached the apex of the resonance of the voice; and as you look around at the ghostly white faces with their gaping mouths and glazed eyes, you feel a piercing pain starting at the pit of your stomach and suddenly running down your throat and ... well, you get it. But despite all his dislikes and punches in the face, Frownland, it really is a remarkable job that, after seeing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic problems and setbacks, makes you want to scratch your own eyes and At the same time, you feel sorry for him. It would have been much easier for me to simply get out of Ronald Bronstein's film, but for some insane people. For that reason, I felt an unwavering determination to stay on course and experience all the gritty irritation that the film has to to offer. If someone burns you, you usually want to erase: Stop! Drop! And slip! But with this movie, you want to see the flame slowly engulf your entire body. You support the pain - perhaps out of spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can not even begin to try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, conventional cinema will never let this movie get to a theater near you. . But if you get the chance to get it, get ready: bring a puppy bag.
