This movie is a remake of two films that have been much better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you watch this one. This is not so good. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock begins to show some of the comedic fun that took him to where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like a very bad "B" movie where people seem to be in some bad sit-com with TV. The situations are forced and it's like they're just trying to get the story so they could start the actual movie. Everything seems fake and the editing is bad. I do not know how they could release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and see it then.
