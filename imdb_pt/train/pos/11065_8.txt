This comedy with a lot of underlying pain and sadness happens where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors trying to achieve this indescribable mixture that has not even come close to the depth and dexterity of this. This is certainly because the exceptional cast with excellent performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly grabs their interests and emotions and keeps them throughout the film. At first the action seems a little strange and imprecise, but one gradually learns that these two pathetic, damaged people are desperately and involuntarily trying to heal, even reluctantly, for each other. Rogers's sickly facial expressions numb, and Sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that we feel them as if we were watching them. You will care for these two pleasant but deeply hurt people, and expect them to succeed because they are in doubt and all depends on a fine emotional thread. I hope the public can see more about Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this film proves its merit as very talented actors, no doubt.
