If you came to the movie with expectations, throw them away now, because no advertising campaign will do justice to the film. <br /> <br /> Categorizing this movie into a single genre would be criminal. It's a spy thriller, it has elements of noir, bits of action, science fiction and cyberpunk, all linked by a brilliant narrative, plot twists and dazzling cinematography. <br /> <br /> The comments here have focused on being derived, both bad and good, from other films. But, as they say, every story is drawn from Shakespeare, so once you get through it, you'll have a great ride. <br /> <br /> You need to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: the elevator) suffering from a low budget and somewhat extravagant visuals. Do not misunderstand this to say that you are on the same level as Sci-Fi science fiction films, because that is at a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn it off. This is pure psychology. But if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to an unheard-of cinematic experience, by all means, DO IT NOW! Watch this movie now before it's cool to see it!
