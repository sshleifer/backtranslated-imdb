This cartoon was strange, but the story really had a little more depth and excitement than other cartoon movies. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and hardly any other friend except a brother and sister who are just miserable as she is. It reaches the lowest point and when the opportunity arises, it literally makes a pact with a demonic demon. I found this film very faithful to life and when things could not be worse, the girl sees what she did, feels remorse and then changes and then helps this dark and mystical creature learn the human quality of love. The twins also improve by helping the teddies and then gain a sense of self-esteem as well. A very positive message for the children, although some elements of the film are strange, was and still is a very nice film. The music of Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the film even better
