I saw this movie in the worst possible circumstances. I had already lost 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but I was quickly fascinated by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who had been kidnapped. The premise began to take turns and twists that I did not see coming, and by the final credits I was going through the flight guide to find out what I had just seen. Turns out I was late discovering Do-yeon Jeon, who won the award for Best Actress in Cannes for the role. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to find out more.
