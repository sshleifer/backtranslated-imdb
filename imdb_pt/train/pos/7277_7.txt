This is a strange film about an archaeologist who studies the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a mummy (really false) from a funeral cave and takes it home to study it. Well, soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. And then his son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even more strange events occur when the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. This really is really annoying in general and will make you fall asleep the first few times you try to watch it. But if you continue, you can come to an end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the spirit of the mummy angry because it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to determine what the motivation of the spirit is, but if you like spooky tricks with a low budget (and 70's hairstyles!), This will have a certain comforting appeal. <br /> <br /> The way I have described the story is much clearer than the messy and boring way the movie casts history. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... somehow this one succeeds. Maybe this is a good movie at heart, but run in a rather strange way. I do not know. What I do know is that I enjoyed it a little, despite its stupidity. <br /> <br /> "Spider Baby" fans will be interested to know that some songs from this movie are used in this movie. (including an instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> Presenting a frightening and pretty well done sequence showing sequences and possessed rocks rolling by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a trailer. Other scenes from the film are merely scary or quirky; but this scene is really very scary. <br /> <br /> See this! It's weird and worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.
