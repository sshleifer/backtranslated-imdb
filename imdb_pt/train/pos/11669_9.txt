Being the prototype of Errol Flynn's classic adventure film and having a good story as well as two brighter co-stars on Maureen O'Hara (what an extraordinary beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to all those who have even the slightest taste for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
