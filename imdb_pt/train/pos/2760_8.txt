Everyone we know influences our thinking, modifies our ways, a little of that person passes over us. "The eighth day" addresses this theme (compare with "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil), a businessman specializing in sales psychology, meets with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child with Down syndrome on the run. The winning performances of both actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent, where Georges relates his theory about the creation of the world and, in the final scene, we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, who is completely uninhibited, requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene in which the Down Syndrome group on a trip to the Art Gallery escape in a bus and gate crash the Paradis amusement park. The funniest of all the embarrassments is the scene in which Harry and Georges pass a horse on the road and, looking back, Georges gives a rude greeting to the driver. But there are also some gentle scenes, especially the impressive use of close-ups of hands - hands feeling the sun, wind and rain, hands stretching, hands stretching and hugging each other with love and friendship. This is the real cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where Georges proposes to Nathalie, where Georges packs Harry's head in his arms, where Georges keeps calling for his beloved mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh ... I felt that there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful - the very presence of grass (did you know that you cry when you cut it?), the trees above, the song of the birds, the small insects - all the miraculous creatures of nature. They are all there to be appreciated if we but to lie back (like Harry and Georges), look around us and listen ...... A beautiful film.
