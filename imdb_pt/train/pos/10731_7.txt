I notice that the DVD version seems to have scenes or missing lines between the FRF post and the release. <br /> <br /> They must prove that they can earn the right to sit on the FRF beyond the green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene is like during his failure in the simulation, Kevin gets Joaquin I think the VHS edition other than ABC may have all the things that are missing. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I'd like to know which DVD version has the missing material. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched seems to be edited for television.
