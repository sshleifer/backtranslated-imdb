"The Groove Tube" was one of only two Ken Shapiro films, the other being the equally bizarre "Modern Problems". This is just a parody of large-scale TV. In addition to Shapiro - who apparently did nothing after "Modern Problems" - the film also stars Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer, Henry Winkler's cousin. The three cast members (plus a few other people in smaller roles) appear in various sketches. One of the funniest presents Chase in a Geritol counterfeit commercial, in which he is describing the drug as his wife, and ends up with her fucking him. There is also a pornographic news program, an annoying cooking show, and the epic tale of some drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the whole thing is just a real hoot. In my opinion, the three best TV spoofing movies are this, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I can also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what happened to Ken Shapiro.
