Arthur Bach needs to grow, but unfortunately this is not the only thing he needs to do. According to his extremely wealthy father, Arthur has to marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson or he is cut off from family money ($ 750 million dollars). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (though I hear she makes a good chicken) and has just fallen headlong into waitress Linda-Marolla, who works half-shift at the store. Arthur is an interesting guy. He's really just a big kid, born in riches with at least one person taking care of him every second of every day. Working just drives Arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun, womanizing and, of course, drinking. Drinking gives Arthur a kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while this puts you in all sorts of problems, it's absolutely hilarious to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is great here in this movie as Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film, turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comic gold, but he is also great at bringing Arthur up to a relatable level and making the character nice. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, the witty no one with whom Arthur does not tire, and John Gielgud is as good as Arthur's butler, Hobson. Gielgud won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this film, and there is no question as to why. Hobson has a dry and solid wit but is always looking for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect on paper. Steve Gordon's 1981 film, Arthur, is short and simple, but offers lots of laughs.
