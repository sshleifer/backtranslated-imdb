"Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about other football, but for English fans, it's equivalent to "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan." Any young footballer dreams of doubling a soccer ball around a player and playing in the net for a goal, as does David Beckham, just as young Indian Jess (Parminder Nagra) does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. . Jess likes to play football games, the type banned by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a traveling friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) watched her play and invited her to a traveling football team. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but a girl doing what she wants to do, even if it goes against culture, not just parents. There is humor played throughout the film, especially when Jules's mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film uses a clich√©, since the big football game is on the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it's not a joke, but it's fun and light. The football action looks good, so the sports fans are going to have fun, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the football world will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, but a girl trying to meet and please her parents at the same time, something that proves quite difficult.
