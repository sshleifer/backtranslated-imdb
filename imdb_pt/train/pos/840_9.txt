I was not sure what to expect from this movie. I love seeing Brosnan in any movie, he's always good, but that was totally different. He is a mess and plays very well. In fact, he reminded me of myself sometimes in uni :) So yes, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but the dialogue is cracking, the acting is excellent and very refreshing, and it's very funny too :) I I do not think you're going to leave the theater saying "Wow! I was impressed", but you'll leave smiling, having enjoyed a good movie. I can not ask for more than that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you are lucky, some idiot will put the wrong ad and you will be reversed, upside down, inverted (with inverted audio) ads !! Bright. Nothing like watching an ad from Jack Daniels, where the drink returns to the glass bottle with an American commentary "Twin Peaks":
