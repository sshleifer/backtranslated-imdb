Madhur Bhandarkar is keen to address taboo issues and gives the more realistic image of modern society. One gets the director's impression of even his previous films, such as Satta and Chandni bar. The issues just suggested in the last film are explored and fully exposed here. The cast is incredible and one can see the judgments in each scene from many angles. Mostly, the movie leaves you thinking about many facts around. When you begin to guess things, you end up being very close, but miss the mark in many scenes. It leaves a lasting impression at the end. <br /> <br /> The actors to watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni, among others. The dialogues are well written and you feel like you've lived around some of these people. There are still some scenes that make you think in more depth. The songs are in the background saving time and the voice of Lata in a very significant song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling alone in the middle of modern society!
