*** Spoilers * My father recorded this movie for me when I was 3 years old. At age 5, I watched more than 400 times. I just watched and watched. And I still do today! It has a dark plot, the mother of a lamb is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb is transformed into something really evil. He and the wolf travel to their old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter how much he wishes. He ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his old friends, and can not return to his former lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the songs are .. well, okay, and dubbing is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> All in all, you just have to see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
