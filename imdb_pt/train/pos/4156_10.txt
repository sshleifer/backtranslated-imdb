I've watched a lot of episodes of Cold Case since its debut (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the best examples of writing and acting I've seen in Bruckheimer's house. and the script and editing, soundtrack and acting made this episode a tour d'force.If I were the producers, I would send this episode to Emmy for consideration.The picture was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of the 48-minute episode, which makes a lot of talented people do their best. I hope there is an early warning of when this episode repeats itself because I'm sure I'll notice a lot that I did not notice for the first time .
