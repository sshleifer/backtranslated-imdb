Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not at all a bad movie. Actually, I really like that. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is tacky and the story is rarely told. But Darkheart, while very dark is a pretty convincing villain, and Hadley Kay did a great job expressing it. Speaking of the dubbing, it was great, nothing wrong with that. The animation is colorful, and some of the visuals, particularly in the beginning, were breathtaking. The songs and sheet music are adorable, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter always been my personal favorite of the two. The cares, whom I like, are adorable, and human children are also well made. And the end is a real tearjerker. All in all, harmless children's fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
