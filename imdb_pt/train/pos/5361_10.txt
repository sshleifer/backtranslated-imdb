If you have been educated on a diet of gameshows you will understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix. Well, in the world of Running Man, your needs will be met. For in this game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate prize - their own lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was a parody of the jaw we witnessed daily. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it's a really good movie. The underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very convincing and is very well portrayed in this film. Of course there are the usual Arnie headlines, my favorite is when he's about to be played in the game zone, and the game host asks "Any last word?" Arnie says, "Yeah, I'll be right back," but the host plays "Just in one replay" and pushes the eject button. I give this movie a 10 for sheer originality. I must have watched 30 or more times. The only film besides the Die Hard series that I watched this many times !! <br /> <br /> In short, I do not even think for a minute that you own T.V. - It owns you .....
