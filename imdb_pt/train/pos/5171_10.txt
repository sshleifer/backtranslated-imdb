If I could go back, even as an adult and relive the days of my past summer at camp ... I would be there so fast. The camps I went to were not even that big. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes really carry people, but we have horses and fishing. The cinematography was amazing, the characters funny and believable, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and sub-pranks were invaluable. So who thought that this movie was lame ... I feel sorry because they can not suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine life in the camp again as an adult or have never been like children. The main point was that these people had the opportunity to regress and become young again and they did so at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was funny, clever, beautifully scripted, brilliantly released and the art takes me back, so I want to watch it several times just for the scenery. Sorta like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies, but the desert becomes as much a character as the actors. Rent, see, buy and watch over and over ... it never gets old. 0)
