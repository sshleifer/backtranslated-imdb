Okay, I'll admit it. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the film is loaded by a sometimes predictable but reasonable storyline. <br /> <br /> Beginning, we are introduced to the three women leaders the film. A director - very concerned about her image and never married. A policeman - with son and a bad ex to go on. The third - a doctor hungry for power and status, with a desire for recognition and three ex's. <br /> <br /> They are almost the "First Wives Club", and in fact there are many verbal assaults from former involved as well as some "he left credit card behavior". Defined characters - the movie continues. McDowell's character, the director, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (Doughty), catches his eye. What will your two friends say about the subsequent damage? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A tissue or two recommended if you're the tearful type - the uplifting end, but maybe not what you'd expect. In short, a great movie that stands out among the current options of action, special effects and schlock horror.
