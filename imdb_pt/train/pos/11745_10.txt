if you get the chance to see this movie, see. It's quite shocking in parts and really makes you think of so many important issues, but it's not didactic. in my opinion, is a work of art ... beautifully shot, good music of many styles, the typically impressive level of performance that is expected from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (advertised as 'Natalie' Press) is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager explored by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has that wonderfully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving stability of action and the comfort of the viewer knowing that someone out there is actually "normal", but the real star is Timothy Spall - certainly one of the greatest actors of our time !
