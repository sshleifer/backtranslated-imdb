After that it was considered the official trilogy of Dirty Harry with The Enforcer (1976) to be the last chapter of the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirtier and tougher than ever since the original 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has in the past killed a murderous psychopath, vigilante cops, and veteran Vietnam veterans. But now he's after a new killer, a killer who wants to return, firing on his attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings a new meaning and a darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is in a new murder case that is circling back to a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped along with her sister, who is left traumitized. Ten years later, she is out for revenge, firing on her assailants. At the same time though, Callahan is in trouble for his superiors after he provokes a mob boss in a heart attack, which the mob is also hunting him for. So, to let the heat die inside the city, Harry can take a vacation in a seaside town, but at the same time the raped victim is also in town while hunting his attackers one by one. Harry is in the investigation and finds the murders very similar, since he lives in the tracks of the assassin. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact, in my opinion, has to be one of my 10 revenge movies, as well as being the second best Dirty Harry movie, much better than The Enforcer and The Dead Pool together. Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a somber tone with amusing value. <br /> <br /> So you feel lucky, punk?
