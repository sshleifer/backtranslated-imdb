Louis Sachar's children's classic is as Disney as Freddy Krueger. It has murder, racism, facial disfigurement and murderous lizards. <br /> <br /> Designed with clarity, it's an interlocking story that covers the story to reveal Stanley's heritage and the secret behind the potholes. It runs from the lush green of Latvia to the green Camp Green Lake (hint: there is no lake and there is no green). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success is to recreate the mood of the novel so convincingly - the design of the setting is superb and lackluster. The other advantage is in the cast. Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the fat kid in the book, but his attitude is right and he is far from being the common hero. The rest of the cast is equally well filled, from Patricia Arquette as the frontier school that turned bank robber to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and the sentiment has increased to the full volume at the end.
