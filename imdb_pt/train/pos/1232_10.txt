Very funny movie. Funny classic movie Eddie Murphy from the 80's. I saw it when I was a kid and I have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. Murphy in the 80's made many action movies that represented him a way to play around with everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the 1986 film so far has changed. The atmosphere for a movie of the time is good and the special effects are good for a period film. A good movie to watch and enjoy enjoying the ironic taste of Murphy, an actor who recently disappeared. The final part is anthologies, the sympathetic actor who plays the Tibetan monk. That's it.
