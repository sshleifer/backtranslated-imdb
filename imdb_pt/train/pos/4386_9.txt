This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw him, the Scottish accents made it difficult for me to understand much and this ruined the viewing experience. I gave up on that, but then I got the DVD, I used the English subtitles when I needed them, and I really got into this movie, figuring out how good it is. It is excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen image makes it spectacular in parts, with a wonderful and sturdy setting, and the story reminded me of Braveheart, a tale involving good versus evil. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (bad). They both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors are as despicable as Roth. Dude, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant and annoying puss. (He is so unpleasant and vile that sick critics love his character more than anyone else here.) Neeson is the man of a man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as the female lead. The movie attracts you and totally envelops you, so prepared to have an emotional experience seeing it.
