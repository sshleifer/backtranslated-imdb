I do not even know what to say about this movie. is one of the few films that I would consider romantic. to try to talk about plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of franz zappa "how to dance about architecture". It perfectly reaches the nail in the head, capturing those fleeting moments in the life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems to be the movie that the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no deep life lessons, just a couple of excited and intelligent children exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unreal of feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
