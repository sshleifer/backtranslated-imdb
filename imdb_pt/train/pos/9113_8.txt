Probably the first Portuguese film I've seen in my life and I liked it. The plot is told of how young army officers seized power in Portugal in 1974 to finally defeat Caetano's fascist government and also end the wars in the colonies, namely Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers to carry out the coup, of the oppressed people, who was very happy with this new development and the freedom, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of more conservative officials, including Spinola, who took office as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop democratically, and that is what the country achieved a few years after that coup. or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected in the end.
