In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first of Barbra Streisand's monumental television specials. The show was not only an audience success but also received 5 Emmy Awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of 1960s television and (unfortunately) the kind of special television they do not produce anymore. Filled with wonderful music and a spectacular performance by Barbra, this special is a must see for any Streisand fan and anyone interested in the beginning of television.
