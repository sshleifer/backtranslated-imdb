I think this is to be some kind of reworking or updating of "Beauty and the Beast" but I can not say I've ever watched a movie that started with several minutes of sex with graphic horses. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young girl and her aunt? Have traveled to this castle in France, where the woman is to marry the son of the owner of the castle, who is the man who takes care of ensuring that the horses take their stones. It seems there are legends in that area of ​​a beast that was a little playful, I think you could say, with women, or at least one in particular. There are all sorts of references hidden in this regard, but every time the young bride, about to blush, take her curious little hands in one, the groom's father takes her out of sight. Anyway, the young bride goes to sleep upstairs while the family expects a cardinal to come to the wedding (a family member, I think) and while she dreams, she dreams of a beast in the forest that has her with her. The effects of that leave a little to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not that I know much about it) is kind of ridiculous, especially when certain appendages look as realistic as a bed or a baseball bat. This has a rather strange and abrupt ending, though twisted, without really any clues or much about it, but it was kind of appropriate and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, this is difficult to understand, but it has its moments and it's definitely strange. 7 out of 10.
