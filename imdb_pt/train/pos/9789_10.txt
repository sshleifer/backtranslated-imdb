The story is being told fluently. There are no interruptions. Flash backs are woven at present with no problems. Casting was excellent. The young Ya'ara looked much like Ya'ara would have looked at that age. His portrait of a blind person was made convincingly. Director Daniel Syrkin did a great job of getting the various actors to work together on this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel like you're with Ya'ara and Talia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to note that although "out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" Both names are very appropriate for the story.
