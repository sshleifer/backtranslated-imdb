I saw this film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival and had the privilege of meeting the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of them new and sincere. The title of the movie in Amsterdam was to keep the river to its right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism a little less prominent. Equally important was the love-and-gay relationship that Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His meeting at nearly 80 years of age and the inevitable exit were very touching. I can only highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.
