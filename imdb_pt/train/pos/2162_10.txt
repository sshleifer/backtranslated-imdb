I was so surprised when I saw this movie so underrated ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its pace is slow, a feature of Japanese films. However, if you are absorbed in the movie like me, you will find this is not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. "Shall we Dansu?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It's very different from Hollywood's, for example. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a joke is guaranteed every two minutes. On the contrary, it's carefree, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple but pleasant. I was so happy to see that Sugiyama (the leading role) found the meaning of life in dance. Before watching the film, I was slightly depressed due to heavy school work. I felt lost. However, this movie made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat as Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why could not I? It reminded me of "exploring my own future" and discovering happiness in my daily life. It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find dance scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kind of like it because I feel like the characters are really "alive", learning to dance while the movie continues. <br /> Above all, this film is both encouraging and stimulating. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. Definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes Aoki is funny :-D
