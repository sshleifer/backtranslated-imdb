The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I first saw the Christmas lure at Radio City Music Hall when he left and loved it ever since. I ended up seeing it 6 times in theaters, and if I was playing today I would go out to see it again. <br /> <br /> Now many of the reviews here have mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads. Matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being named against Jack Nicholson's performance at Randall P. MacMurphy's Oscar in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo." Burns won, although Richard Benjiman deserved at least being nominated as well. roles were played to perfection, such as Fritz Feld doing the test for the commercial of French fries. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my reason to review this film, the direction of the much underestimated Herbert Ross. A play of person, "The Owl and the Kitten" on the screen and made a full movie with him, does it again, he opens the pieces without making them look like a play of photographic theater, he reveals the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes from the movie before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell about the special comedy. play for the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is brand new. A few years ago I saw the Broadway revival with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think Ross and the writer, the playwright Simon, have improved that. It's just a wonderful movie.
