This is an almost perfect movie. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly. This is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition. The film has the idea that we are all criminals, nobody is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this piece in our own society every day? The film is very structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, ruined, and everyone is participating in the deception. Could anything be truer? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.
