I remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and was wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie would come out soon, so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us previews for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. It was not necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the first name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet and a lot of worm eating. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the kid who cooks most worms likes to present their masterpieces with a French accent. As children know each other, the number of children involved, how the wager came up, the number of worms that should be consumed, the length of time in which he has to eat the worms, how they are cooked, progression of friendships, climax scenes , etc., NOTHING is the same. But somehow, that did not spoil the movie for me. The characters are all nice, and the movie did not disappoint me. Word of caution to the parents, there was a time when you could hear the adults in the room collectively drawing their breath and that was when Billy's younger brother referred to his penis as a "jerk." The embarrassing part came when my daughter began to ask those sitting around us, "Does anyone know what an asshole is?" I laughed a lot. That and an occasional "shut up" is as talkative as this movie. My daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty container of nacho just in case), but she was fine with the worm 6. She and I really enjoyed the movie and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.
