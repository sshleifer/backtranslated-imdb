This movie contains personalities who are so deliciously playing their parts, I love the end, when no one knows what they are going to do about their life, but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, it's jut for two then What are the other people doing there? The film embraces a new life, the experiences, the power to dream about the other person and achieve those dreams. It also shows life itself, how difficult it is. But it gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this review works for you. The movie worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) Be careful.
