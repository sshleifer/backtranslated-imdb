I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD someday. The episode with the eccentric brother genius of Hilton, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is a classic hilarity. It reflects the rivalry between classic brothers and love between brothers whose lives went different paths, but both ended up happy. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad have brilliantly recaptured the chemistry they shared at The Cosby Show for many years and putting them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> The list of comic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
