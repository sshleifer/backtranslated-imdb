This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I had the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, even if it was something exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many funny phrases and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest of the cast is not bad either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat. <br /> <br /> The story can get very confusing at times when new characters appear during the movie. Things get trickier because no one rarely tells the truth about things. If you do not pay attention things can get a bit messy in the end but I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not that well-known, but he did a perfectly OK job with this one. and I never got impatient while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Made men are well worth checking out.
