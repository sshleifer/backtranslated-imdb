It's a very good movie, not only for fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated movies / adventure and fantasy series. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who is killed for something she did not do, but for being who she is the daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> So she seeks revenge ... and the rest is better to see him from the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters are like the original comics, they form the Chaos. I've never had a chance to read the first parts of the comic, only the latest ones, after the passages in the movie, so I can not tell if the events are exactly like the comic, but ... one way or another is the story from Lady Death!
