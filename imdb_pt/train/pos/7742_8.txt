Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern movie noir a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting, because they all offer good performances and intriguing characters. <br /> Patric does the narration in this noir, playing a former boxer and mentally ill. Wow, this just makes an interesting face! He looks dumb, but he is not. Ward is the sneaky, attractive, cynical, intelligent, and compassionate co-conspirator of a bad kidnapping plan. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in any movie. <br /> <br /> The movie may be considered a bit unpleasant for the average viewer, but I found it fascinating ... and I do not like to depress movies normally. What I found was some kind of peculiar crime movie. Take a look and see if you agree. This is a quite unknown movie that should not have this status because it is simply a good story and well done.
