My family returned to New Orleans in the late 1600s in the early 1700s, and by watching the movie I knew it was a story my grandparents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have obviously black cousins, also known as African-Americans and others who manage to "pass" as whites and have chosen not to. It's a difficult story to watch when you realize that your family is talking and that Cane River is part of that story. It makes me want to cry and that makes me want to kick the asses of my great grandparents who owned these plantations and admire how my great-grandparents of the African heritage lived under this oppressive and still aristocratic existence ... And at the same time, if I did not leave this story, I probably would not be the successful business woman who I am living today successfully in a reasonably integrated world. The acting was excellent and fair, depending on the actor, but it is a film that needed to be done. Anne Rice is amazing and I wonder, why is she "symbolically" writing about my family and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
