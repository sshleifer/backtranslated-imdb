I rented this blockbuster movie on a whim .. I like alan arkin and the cover was taking ... I read the back and knew immediately that it was going to be the best or the worst movie I've ever seen ... I think I had lucky .. I laughed from start to finish .. alan arkin brings a great character to this movie. Since then I bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watched it all the time .. I recommended this movie to loads of people and they all liked it as much as I did ... I see complaints about the menus and DVD functions .. but does not strip the movie .. the disc was created for exculsivley Blockbuster that is why they do not allow you to skip the previous ones .. plus you should not let the DVD functions to prevent you from watching the excellent movie.
