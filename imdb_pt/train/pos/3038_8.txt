As Douglas MacArthur affected more human lives - for better - than any other unelected American president, he deserved a better cinematic biography. Not that Universal's "MacArthur" is bad. It's not all it should have been. <br /> <br /> As incredible as it may seem, the potential was there. From the first episode of "Star Trek," "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the recent HBO films "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent emerged as a of the most expressively human directors in the cinema, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional nuances of his actors' performances and taking the audience exactly where he wants to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (1907), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films, and Universal widely praised the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production." However, for all of this, "MacArthur" is perfectly adequate and not much more than that. The film begins in early 1942, shortly before the besieged general was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) to flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus, this film omits: • MacArthur's birth in 188O in a border barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by members of the Native American tribe, thus establishing that his remarkable life extended from the distance between arches and arrows. for thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · Your West Point graduation ?? first in a class of 95, as he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who won the Medal of Honor on Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on missions in Japan, China, and more important in the Philippines; his heroic exploits on the 1914 tour in Vera Cruz; as he jumped on the trenches of World War I as a mountain goat, often wounded, and promoted with blinding speed to the Brigadier General; his post-war service as the youngest and most progressive commander of West Point; <br /> <br /> his participation in Billy Mitchell's martial court in 1924; <br /> <br /> • its forwarding of the demonstrators in 1932; His efforts to support an army lacking resources as chief of staff in the early 1980s; His retirement from the US Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Philippines Army; <br /> <br /> and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /> <br /> Is all this omitted in favor of prolonged filming of MacArthur trying to combat nausea by being evacuated by PT boat? Thus, we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not the reason; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so damaging to "Dugout Doug" and so patently unfounded. <br /> <br /> The remainder of his career is currently direct: 'Hit' in them are not 'campaign, the fulfillment of his promise to the Filipinos? "I'll be back!", His greatest achievement, the post-war victory of peace in Japan, and then his dissent with President Harry Truman over the conduct of the Korean conflict that resulted in his final resignation. and finally his proclamation to Congress that "old soldiers" simply disappear, after which he did just that. All very historically accurate, and all presented with a deliberate lack of comments. Sargent and the producers almost distanced themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: if MacArthur's actions seem noble, let them be presented as such; if they seem selfish or bombastic, that these conceptions record without comment. As Joe Sargent is quite adept at subtly manipulating his audience's reactions again, see Warm Springs - this refusal to offer comments seems quite intentional. Historically, this may be commendable, but almost nullifies the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a kind of "made low price". feel for the film, as there is for "Midway", released at the same time. Both films were relegated to "television" directors - Sargent, in this case Jack Smight in "Midway," and both have a TV-made look. Even Jerry Goldsmith's marching, while perfectly useful, lacks the subtle tones and grandeur of his "Patton" theme - just another way a man greater than life is remembered for a very ordinary movie. <br /> <br /> There was vanity and pettiness in this man, indisputably; there was also greatness and love or detestation, we must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done: he conquered peace. <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur" Like so many movie biographies is a good place to start researching about this remarkable man but a poor place to end it.
