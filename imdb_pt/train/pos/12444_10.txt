The best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's like a good pilot for a TV series. I even think it's a bit "cult", as with a light touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic, or something. They took a lot from the Modesty character, but I admit that I miss Willy Garwin. Even though I have read many comics and books by Peter O'donnell, I am not disappointed with this film, quite the contrary. Positive surprised with this story about Modesty and his childhood. I did not put my expectations so high, because of the bad movie of 1966. So I may have overestimated that movie a bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this one! I can not wait for a follow-up ...
