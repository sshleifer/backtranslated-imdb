You will notice from the stars that I gave this GREAT movie that '... before you see it for the first time', is implied. I had never heard of this movie and it happened across just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not great coming up). I'm not sure how this movie went through me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, it happened. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. He had the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; Just enough. The entire movie is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. I would have given this movie 10/10, however, some of the shots were very fake. I do not think that much against this movie, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's much underestimated as a serious talent. Nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and does not rest on her looks to take her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. And it may seem cold and even lifeless if necessary, too. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam does very well, at first, like a very geek corporate mouse, willing to go through any maze to prove himself. However, as it changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other aspirants to become the next James Bond will hate me for it, but Northam would / could / should fit into that account. He is gentle and cultured. He has a great posture and voice of Bond. I think it can also be cold if the situation requires it, and quite realistic, too. <br /> <br /> The great film and definitely this movie fan recommends that you be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage movies.
