Once in a lifetime means that once a thug, always a thug, and no one enters or leaves "The Life" for free. Neighbors in New York sell drugs and perform scams because they can not do it in the legitimate world, maybe because they have criminal records, drug habits, or because they're just lazy. This simple story, with a few twists and turns on despicable characters, manages to attract public sympathy for its top players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 Mike (all henchmen have nicknames), and is based on his play, "Riff Raff." It looks like a play from start to finish, especially during the longest scene in which the top three players come together to decide who can be trusted. Often the dialogue comes very fast, much faster than it would be on stage, and I think it's the biggest flaw in the movie. Mixed as flashbacks throughout the movie are poems from the street, a kind of rap yammeric pentameter, which is violent and evocative of the world this movie unfolds. Poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, these thugs who murder, deceive, and betray one another, as unworthy of our attention or beneath our contempt. The most disturbing part of this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is very stupid, another is an addict, and the latter suffers from awareness as the audience asks, or even laughs, at the irony of executioners demanding that he hang on the gallows to tell jokes in the middle of his death.
