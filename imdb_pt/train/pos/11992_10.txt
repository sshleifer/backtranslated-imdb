As long as I remember, I love airplanes and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and hit me, that was it. My parents bought all the tapes they had and this was the only show I watched as a child. I had the theme memorized while I grew up and I can still recite it today. It's absolutely amazing and I'm thinking of buying the DVD soon! It's really great for kids and adults and it's absolutely timeless. I can not get enough of this show.
