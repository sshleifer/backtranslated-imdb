Now this show looks like most other shows of the type from the mid-90s, but the only thing is about it is that it's different, they use lots of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little drama too. I personally thought it was a good show, I can not understand why they would cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive from 1997 until today. <br /> <br /> My hope is that WB brings back the show or even make a movie, which I know will be impossible to do, but hey it does not hurt to dream, does it? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend that if you had not seen to find the DVD of all 13 episodes because the characters are great, the stories are good, the comedy is good and the whole show is great.
