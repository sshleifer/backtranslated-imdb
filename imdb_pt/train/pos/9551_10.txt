I must say I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. Scenery and acting are very good. The director did a good job too. Although some scenes seem a bit awkward, it's a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself until the end. The atmosphere of the mental hospital was very good. The plot was clear, consistent, and well thought out. Some people may find it a bit annoying since the story line is very focused and they take the time to develop characters and stories. Moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its genre and it's surprisingly good.
