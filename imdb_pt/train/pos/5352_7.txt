This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know it, I've saved a lot of your time to read this review. If you do not like Arnold then you will not like this movie. If the case is the other then you will probably like it. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're still reading this, I hope you enjoy Arnold. Good for you! He is very good, is not he. Running Man is a very typical feature of Arnold. He has the usual retro-future that we know so well from the 80's B-Sci Fi, has a lot of terrible sentences, a lot of violence and explosions, and a good heroine and a happy ending. <br /> In this case, the malevolent opponent is the 1984 government that controls everything, which uses television as an effective crowd control with gladiator-type game programs. Arnold, of course, ends up at one of those shows and turns everything upside down, with a little help from his two confederates and the beautiful Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget. film, but still managed to create a very good atmosphere of the future with some beautiful paintings and scenarios to help you. It's hopelessly 80's, but I find that charming. The acting varies, Arnold making his grunt and scream of always, with a lot of phrases of effect. Heroine Amber is, to say the least, somewhat stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws, the film shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also features some in the futuristic digital video editing, allowing thugs to change faces in a video to deceive their audience. This does not look futuristic these days, which is a bit alarming. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold's movies, you know when to watch this movie. Appreciate.
