I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later. The story of a prodigal son (Scott Cohen) returning to the custom furniture business of his family after a period in jail, offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama - memorable characters; sharp dialogue and observer; sensitive use of the camera by a visually-looking filmmaker. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it features something that is very rare in multiplex these days: the uncompromising view of a mature sensitivity. The talent of director and screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to emerge, but we get the feeling that he (as his protagonist) paid off his debts. He knows how real people fight in this world, and he knows how eager to see - or at least indirectly - experience success. However, Yellin respects his audience too much to blow up happy smoke in our butts. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph is not in commissions, not even in the esteem of his family, but in the "job" he could not give up if he tried. <br /> <br /> It's an essential theme in a world (and especially a film industry) that can not rise above the "bottom line." This movie deserves a large audience.
