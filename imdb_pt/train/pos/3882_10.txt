I watched this tape, immediately rewound, watched again and giggled twice. I strongly recommend this tape to those who are not hateful but uncomfortable with transvestites. This shows that transvestism is a characteristic, not the totality of being. Comedy is not a single problem. This man is brilliant. All comics should aspire to their level of openness, intelligence and talent.
