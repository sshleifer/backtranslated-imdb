I really like this show. I can readily see how it achieved cult status. It's original and thought-provoking. For some reason though, I've never felt the kind of resonance I could have. It does not have the kind of open door, the cold of winter that should be gotten from such an incredible premise. Each time I watch an episode, I get meddled and pressured to respond to some formless and formless question. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me start by saying that what follows is my opinion, and my opinion. opinion only. Different traits for different people. <br /> <br /> I wish I had seen more scenes in "American Gothic" that were filmed at night. There's a lot of light in this show, and I think it has a tendency to thwart suspense. We are not afraid of the light of day, after all. We're worried about what's in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we are not seeing is often the most frightening. <br /> <br /> Second - and this is what will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is a tremendously talented actor ... a character actor. I followed his career in the films of The Brady Bunch, which is why it pains me to say that he was probably a villain like Lucas Buck. He is almost too petroichan, very nice to incarnate evil, even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotic. He's a hero. He is free-standing in a kitchen lab next to a gallon-O drain. You keep coming back even though you know the end will be madness and death. He should be like the last moneylender. He is a creator of books, but also of indescribable condemnation. Right. You have the money, and in a short time you will also have broken fingers; a severed hand, a decapitated head, and eventually a doomed soul. Turning to Buck is an act of desperation, and whenever he is around, there must be some immediate, environmental purpose-with compound interest daily-in the air. <br /> <br /> It's all generosity, all ties, and when you realize it, you'll also know it's too late. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to three: they showed Buck a little too much. He's in most scenes, actually, which may have made him lose his edge. The sheriff would be like the next door mythology. He is the well-known apocryphal. Many would know "him", but only a few unfortunates would know him. He would be the material for flashbacks, and puzzling conversations, and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposure would have been the vice-character that Nick Searcy portrayed. <br /> <br /> Four, the show could be very self-sufficient. reverential - to a fault, some may say - and this is typified by the whistle of "Meet Me At The Fishing Hole" in the pilot of the series. I think we've already established that what Cassidy and Raimi were shooting was the anti-Andy Taylor. We probably did not need the concept delivered to us via Fed Ex. I understood that in the first five minutes, so for me, the piano in the head was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> These remarks are about what, for ME, would have made a great show. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup. In its eternal quest for LCD programming, the network played a definitive role at the end of this series. <br /> <br /> The least these idiot suits could have done was display the episodes in order. <Br /> <br /> Be real. <br /> <br /> Either way, it's a painful loss for fans of the genre and for casual spectators.
