Bend it like Beckham is filled with intriguing scenes and still has a predictable overall debut line. It's about a girl named Jess who is trying to fulfill her dream of life to become a famous football player and finally has the chance when offered a position on a local team. There are so many boundaries and limits that she faces that hinder her, but she is still determined and striving. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good light movie and wants to be inspired by what people can achieve. The music choices are really good, 'shut up my son, just go ahead ... to your destination and you make limits and complications'. Anyway I hope that was the help for your needs in a review. Bend Like Beckham Great Movie
