by Dane Youssef "Coonskin" is a film, by the first and only Ralph Bakshi, is reportedly a satirical accusation of blaxploitation films and black black stereotypes, as well as a look at black life in modern America ( modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount fell like a hot potato that just burst into flames. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi movie, controversial, thrilling and must-see almost by definition. Not just another random "shock-athlete" from a movie that tries to shock because of the shock. It's from Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something great to say ... <br /> <br /> Although its roots are based on cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another chat bored off mainstream white film or any type of disposable film. "Coonskin" wants to be more. The goal is to aim higher and fry some larger fish. <br /> <br /> The film does not just mock the genre. Not only does it indicate black people, but it actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells the story of some convicts waiting for a break in jail. The fact that it is possible to leave a prison only in the "Coonskin" world makes it all outdated. <br /> <br /> One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in Harlem called Brother. Bear, Brother Rabbit, Fox Preacher who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary. The Itallian gang is performing all real action. <br /> <br /> Stars of big black names: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to take home the Pulitzer. Something big is happening here, obviously. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds as a descent into this world, this side of racial division. From an angry black man, hip, deep and soulful, with hatred in the heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi's movies never know the meaning of the word "subalternity." This one seems to have never heard of the word. But maybe such a subject needs extremism. Real satire sledgehammer. Some subjects can not be approached gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is mercilessly condemned. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene seems unharmed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real", depending on the state of mind and the situation. Animated characters and humans share the same reality and must be interpreted literally. Bakshi never shows only ugly cartoons just for shock value. He always has something to say. Even the black face is not free. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled," he seems to be using to try to really say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi films, this incorporates animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just being enigmatic here. All this technique is all intertwined, merging while saying something. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this one seems inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) are very topical, very stimulating at the moment. They reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back on them years later, there is only an unmistakable sense of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). <br /> <br /> Even though music, clothes, slang and The town clearly looks like photos that belong to a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what. Anyone who actually saw the movies, the state of affairs and was in the company of people knows what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some of the black characters are a rabbit (junglebunny), a big bear and a fox. One of the sourest and nasty racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who is on the trail of these "dirty nudes" after a cop's death. But for him, it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who use the shield. It's just pure racist sadistic pleasure to hurt black people. <br /> <br /> The sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving parts of the entire film, of which there are many. It unfolds like an opera or a ballet. <br /> <br /> The promo line: ATTENTION: "This movie offends everyone!" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You've been warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
