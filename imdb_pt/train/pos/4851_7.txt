The Ghost Train is an excellent and entertaining film, typical of the best British comedies of the 1930s and 40s. The tricks of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they used to be, but this can be overcome by viewing it as a period piece or a curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low-budget production in wartime, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective and provides some genuine suspense. Great fun for a dark (and, yes, stormy) night. Lighten up, take the critic's hat off and enjoy.
