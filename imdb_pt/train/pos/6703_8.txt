My kids have recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early N episodes and later episodes on ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not know the show had passed the first or second season) I'm curious to know what motivated all the cast changes - I saw them described as "highly publicized" and still half an hour researching efforts on the web revealed nothing but comments interminable about how the first episodes were much better than the later episodes. (Personally, I do not see much of a difference - the scripts and themes remain pretty much the same throughout the process - but they lose some great people along the way) My daughter put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the land features specials and comments will shed some light on all this. I also wish they had made some self-referential mood about the changes - as in "Boy Meets World," where they leave their sister for a whole season or more, and when a different actor later appears playing her, they ask she where she was and she said "up there," or when the geek "Minkus" shows up for high school graduation, they ask where he's been and he says "there", pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and running off the screen (Mr. Turner being another character that came out) Oh well - maybe there's a real Hollywood story about it or something? I was happy to see Aunt Hilda appear to the end - she's always been one of my favorites - it's a shame that it could not have been a more engaging casting meeting. (The Zelda candle just did not cut it for me)
