This film is nothing short of a somber and somber masterpiece. I can be partial, since the apartheid era is an area that I always felt. But I'd say it ranks with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately until a few days ago I had never heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underrated movies of all time, probably because it was a small movie company, I had never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays well his cowardly role. Do not look for humor in this movie, there are none. It is real, wild and rude to the end, and to the sensitive I would say bring a box of tissues. But movies like this make you wonder, why are the biggest movies never heard?
