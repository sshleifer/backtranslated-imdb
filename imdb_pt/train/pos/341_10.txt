I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see him again as soon as I finished. The cast was excellent, the plot was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just a nice movie overall! I would rate this as one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! The girls were cute too, especially Denise Richards. She was very obsessed during the movie and gave her character a bit of OOMPH!
