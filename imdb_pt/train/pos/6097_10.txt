I do not see how you can say that Freddy's Nightmares are flamboyant and abusive. You obviously do not know good TV when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's Nightmares and hope to have all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series sucks, then you have a right to your opinion, but remember that it's just your opinion and that means nothing. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you will accept that fact soon enough. If you do not like it, then do not watch it, but do not deny its brilliance.
