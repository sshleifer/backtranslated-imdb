It's very funny. There is a great cast that each gives great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well-written screenplay by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like novels, although I never see them. But I love this movie because it is so crazy and off the wall it beats the hell out of any stupid soap they have on the television during the day. In my opinion, it's the best movie of 1991.
