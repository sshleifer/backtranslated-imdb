Most of the feedback I have heard about the Meatball Machine has been quite varied. Some even say they think "it sucked." Well, for these people I say, get some imagination f @ ckin and go to f @ ck yourself. This was a really fun movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug that attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into necroborgs. Eventually, you learn that these mechanical insects also trap a little parasite in you, which then is able to control your actions due to the electrical connection of the nervous system. Unfortunately for two lonely young adults who seek love, they come across the mechanical problem and, before you know it, the transformations are happening and the blood is being spread. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why do necroborgs fight against each other? Can the two desperate singles manage to express their feelings for each other and do the unpleasant? Just a way to find out. <br /> <br /> Going to the Meatball Machine I was a bit suspicious due to mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. Some unanswered questions, some average actions at times, and a somewhat confusing ending are the only weaknesses I can think of. From the anime, to the parasites becoming small characters and even the feeling of low budget, this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses. With an ever-developing storyline that's interesting enough to keep asking questions all mixed up with the cool effects of makeup and blood splatters, this is a movie fans bizarre / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check. 8 out 10
