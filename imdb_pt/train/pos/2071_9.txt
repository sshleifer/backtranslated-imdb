For those of us Baby Boomers who arrived too late to enjoy James Dean et. Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is fairly easy: cool hood meets the sheriff of the small town and All-Hell follows, but the nuts and bolts of this movie enchant the Car Nut in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it's a serious movie about cars, rebellion and the genius that is Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> This and appreciate it for what it is and for what Martin will become. I loved this movie growing up like a teenager in the 70's, and so did you.
