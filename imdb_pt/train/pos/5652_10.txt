I love the series! Many of the stereotypes portraying Southerners as country boys are very apparent, but such people exist very often. The picture of the Southern government is also very true, but the friendly characters also resemble one of the many good things in the South. Some things never change and we see "good old boys" every day! There's a Lucas Buck in every southern town who just needs to call to make things happen, and the "white trash" storybook is all too familiar. Besides the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern south! Somehow I think Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
