I loved this movie! I'm partial seen as I'm a big Disney fan, but I really enjoyed myself. The action takes off running at the beginning of the movie and keeps going! This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they do not spend as much time developing the character (my husband pointed this out) and there are no musical numbers. It is strictly action adventure. I liked it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, be they young or old.
