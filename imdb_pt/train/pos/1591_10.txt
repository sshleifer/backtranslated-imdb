My mom and I just became addicted to this show, laughing a lot! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I'm disappointed I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before being canceled! The plot is very funny, the characters actually have great personalities (or, not so good, but they're still funny!). I have every episode of what I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as the entire cast, never make me bored while watching! There is some language inappropriate for children and some sexual content, but with a near parental guide, you should not have too many problems. There is some kind of 'Friends' relationship that draws me to this show. I really like this.
