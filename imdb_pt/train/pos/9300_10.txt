I do not know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too conscious to me. So when I call it one of my all-time favorites, it has nothing to do with a tribute band mentality. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not realism. It's kafkaesque (a pity that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when he was as good as Josef K), is stylish, knowledgable, sarcastic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum is navigating around a variety of characters, trying not to be shot and acting deftly, instead of stupid, trying to stay abreast of what he knows and not others, whom he can overcome and who he can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (their best performance) have a ball, and the supporting cast looks perfect. The symbolism, the settings (the movement of an outdoor shot with Jeff Goldblum down the steps seems really strange after so much hall), the dialogue (style, not practicality, is the order of the day), it's all about characters interacting, it's not really gangsterism. Fun to watch, it must have been fun to do. What the critics were doing is really a mystery ...
