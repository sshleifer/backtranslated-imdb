I almost did not go to see this movie because I remember March of the penguin was not very exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I went to see it on the opening weekend, but after I went to see it, it was simply amazing; The fact that photographers can capture impossible images simply is worth their money. You can also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the issue of humanity vs. the world, how our lives have strayed from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and miracles that are essential to our biosphere. You do not have to be a land lover or an environmentalist who embraces trees to appreciate the sheer grandeur of this documentary. You simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of life. Appreciate!
