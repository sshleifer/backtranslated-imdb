This episode of Columbus is probably best known to director Steven Spielberg as one of his first films. It should be looked at for the role of Jack Cassidy as the killer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his or her lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear later in Columbus. After all, Columbo finds his match in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who plans to perform the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the bored shop owner / widow who would blackmail him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills her. It's really fun to see Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's familiarity with Columbus makes him watchable after seeing this episode over and over again over the years. What television today forgets about the success of the years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. It is not about who does, how and why, the familiarity of Columbus and his kindness that punctuate with spectators like me.
