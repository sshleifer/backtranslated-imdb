Of course it was well filmed and made, very well filmed and done! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's picture was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was just an idiot. You want to tell me that Lincoln was a smart smart-ass, without respect for the law or the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll call you Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford was going to big funny hero, but I really do not like this guy at all. He cheats on sports, speaks like a real simpleton and does not seem to know whether he should sit in court. How should I take this seriously? <br /> <br /> The turnaround was even weaker. I mean, come here! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed to have been invented by someone 5 years in their dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was a lot of fun and made me laugh on several occasions, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I am good enough, nothing to entertain me and make me laugh may be bad, BUT this vivid and silly story was so ridiculous that I can not understand how anyone would consider it great. > <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this movie was, but if any were true, I would really have to shake my head.
