I first met this show when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away because she thought it was strange, but I found it delicious! Koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and Matsujun's spirit made my day every time I tuned in! I first saw him in "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked him a lot better at it! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to find that they did not change very much during the show. Their relationship grew, but they did not really. Still, a fun time had by all (even for Fukushima!).
