'Five Days' is considered something special, a criminal drama consisting of a series of episodes, each marked on a specific day of a police investigation. But in fact this element of the story ends up being far less significant than might have been initially thought, since the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is hardly perceptible, and very little distinguishes the program from countless others . Crime stories. In fact, we can hardly help but make comparisons with the last 'Prime Suspect', since one of the sub-plots focuses on a female and skeptical cop approaching retirement: it is not just Helen Mirren's absence that makes the unfavorable comparisons. . There is a lot of manipulative, overly serious music, and a set of seemingly invented characters, so that each one is, in some sense, sympathetic, in another suspect. And it is possible to guess the guilty party well before the end, not because of the inner dynamics of the story, but because of the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things must be true to justify the way the series focuses on certain characters at certain times. Despite these shortcomings, the series grew in me: in the end, I was very committed. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which has already done "The Singing Detective," boasted "possibly the best drama of the year": there is little originality on offer here, and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is terribly disappointing . 'Five days' is not really garbage; but it is stereotyped, and one would expect that the best that the BBC had to offer was something a little more innovative and fresh.
