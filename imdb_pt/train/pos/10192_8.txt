This is the Who at its most powerful. Although before the masterpiece Who's Next, it would provide hymns like Baba O'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again. This movie shows the group transitioning from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the '70s. <br /> <br /> Daltrey shows what it's like to be a frontman, Entwistle is as firm as ever. <br /> <br /> Moon is great, check out the conversation in progress with the drum technician, and watch him play side saddle while a bass drum head is replaced! <br /> <br /> Townsend even looks like he's having fun occasionally! <br /> <br /> Since they took the stage at 2 in the morning, no one in the crowd was sleeping! <br /> <br /> There are not many bands that can produce such a tight set these days and it's hard to imagine any of today's bands producing a show that 36 years from now will be enjoyed as much as this.
