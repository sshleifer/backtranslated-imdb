Why did not this get a bag full of Oscar? It is an astonishing interpretation of an often-filmed / performed play. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in widescreen ... the pan & scan really kills the wonderful cinematography and scenery of this movie). Each painting is a painting. Amazing. The move is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it has been clear since the early titles. Not Zefferelli here, just great narrative the way only the film can, but rarely does. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's killer uncle: he does not interpret him as an evil villain with a mustache but a charming politician, allowing us to see why only Hamlet suspects a crime. Branagh also fixes the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's real / false madness and the burning vengeance within it. And the many appearances come in very well, from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Deparded and Charlton Heston, discreet if you get sucked into Branagh's vision the way I was. A mesmerizing piece.
