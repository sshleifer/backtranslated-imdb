A very addictive series. I had not seen an exact match between drama, action, thriller and science fiction ever before. I am impressed with each chapter. The script is very clever, I do not know how the creators invent all these incredible stories, each character has a strange past, problems, stormy relationships, gives the show the human sense needed to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related to each other: the numbers, they met before without knowing, and so on. The others, the cryptic security system and the Dharma initiative are elements that do not let us miss a chapter. <br /> <br /> JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this incredible story?
