This is a very funny (and sexy) movie - which is not just silly, but has great acting. It's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw him at the Boston Film Festival, and I often found myself laughing loudly at everyone else, and also moved by some of the more serious parts of the movie. It's a single movie about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything, but there are some very powerful and very funny scenes - plus the dialogue is great. The character of Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you get a chance to see it - go - you will not be disappointed. Worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
