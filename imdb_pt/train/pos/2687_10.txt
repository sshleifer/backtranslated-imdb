No other movie has made me feel this way before ... and I do not feel bad. Like, I do not want my money back or the time I've waited to watch this movie (9 months) nor do I feel bad for using two hours of a sunny summer day to see it ______. The reason I say "_____" is because no matter how much I destroy my brain, I just can not find a word in ANY of the seven languages ​​in which the movie was made to summarize. I have no idea what was going on all the time and in the middle of the movie I needed a break. No movie has ever done this to me before. Never in my life have I ever wanted cauliflower, milk, and baguettes. Thank you. - Ed. <br /> <br /> Uh. * clears throat * speechless. No thoughts. I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
