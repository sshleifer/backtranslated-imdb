A success at the time, but now better categorized as an Australian cult movie. The mood is ample, not subtle, and in the final scene, a fire in the BBC studio is extinguished by urinating in it. It contains almost all the clichés about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the "old country," and every cliché about the voracious, stuck-up, tearful, Tory Brits. It would be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast of well-known actors, and for the Australians of that generation, who can "catch" the mood. Americans - forget it. The language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and, as such, will be unintelligible.
