I was very moved by the story and because I'm going through something like my own parents, I actually connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing has already been vibrant and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they made and had to live. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I have ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it was done so beautifully. Overall, the film's appearance was impressive, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this photo, he humanizes a man spiraling down. I liked the way the filmmaker approached the life of this woman, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hook us, but not enough to get us bogged down.
