Shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time. The language somehow breaks the barrier of time. but maybe it's the actors who actually do it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), he hesitated to interpret another modern version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character was so well touched by fellow Kenneth! Even though Iago is really mean and despicable, the character has been played so well that it does what Shakespeare intended the character to be, a pleasure for the audience to hate. I have to say that the performance of the fishburne here was also very good. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to the scholars of Shakespeare and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
