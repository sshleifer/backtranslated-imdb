Once at a time, there were different kinds of movies. These different films coexisted even though each had something different to offer ... <br /> <br /> This seems obvious at first, but I thought to point it out during this review because it looks like some people may have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That is all. It is not meant to be something else or something grandiose. People who ridicule him as something who has not kept a promise are not seeing the whole picture - literally. After all, Hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people (Bodyguard or the wife of the preacher w / Whitney Houston are 2 examples that come to mind). <br /> <br /> First I would like to approach the film as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria and later with the Matinatta by Leoncavallo. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular songs like "I left my heart in San Francisco" and the song that was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe, "If we were in love" music by John Williams and lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so of course it will not be something deep or universally applicable to the ordinary movie viewer. It is a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, the "MET" in New York, he loses his voice out of fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)), played by Kathryn Harrold, gives him a chance to heal his psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the chance to have an affair with him and she reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br /> They embark on a case, she knows he is married and promises not to fall in love with him and him, thinking that she will be just another woman. Despite all this, they fall in love (so, the song, "If we were in love") and with her help, he overcomes his fear and returns to the MET, where he triumphs. I will not tell you how it ends, but it is quite predictable. Which is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The performances are not that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you're expecting a performance from Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you're deluded, not Pavarotti. He knows he's not an actor. What he is is cute, charming and charismatic. He's having fun, and if you can have fun too, it's not too bad. A funny phrase is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Fini can soak you!" and of course she says, "I do not want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job as a semi-arrogant woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite phrases in the film is, "Life never needs to be life-size." And there's Eddie Albert, who does his good job as Fini's manager. There are several "own" cameos by real conductors, singers, etc. and is filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera in Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, whether you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let yourself go and enjoy a "little adventure" as he proposes in the movie - then you may enjoy this movie is. I know I do it every time. :) <br /> <br />
