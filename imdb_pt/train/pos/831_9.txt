I saw this movie while under limited release, mainly because of the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It starts almost like a thriller, but progresses progressively to a hilarious work filled with one-liners and great comedic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, while I say this movie is a comedy, do not forget you have a heart at times and it can be very touching when it needs to be. When I entered the theater, I did not know what to expect much more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Leaving the theater, I felt very satisfied with the film and planned to see it again in wide spread. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy with a well-written screenplay and a big mustache.
