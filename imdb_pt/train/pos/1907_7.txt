8 Simple Rules is a funny program, but it also has some life lessons, especially a mature lesson about moving on after a defeat, which was the episode in which Paul died, which was the first episode I watched from the show that appears on ABC. The Hennessy clan - Cate's mother (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and her son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - seek guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter) of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a helping hand. I'm glad that in the second season of this show they decided to put David Spade on this show since he finished the NBC series Just Shoot Me! But all and all this show is very good. This show reminds me of many of the classic sitcoms of the '80s and' 90s that used to be on ABC.
