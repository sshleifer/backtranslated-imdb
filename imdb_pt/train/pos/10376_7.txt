I just saw Roll and what a pleasure it was. Toby Malone's performance really stood out, I caught myself really caring about what happens to Matt throughout the movie, which in itself is a lot of fun, a lot of rhythm with a good mix of well-rounded characters, a great achievement considering his short duration time. There are lots of good twists everywhere as well, this will keep you guessing until the end. Other characters to watch are the totally insane Tiny and the cute Jesse. It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let that put you off, you can do far worse than checking this, you will not regret it. Good fun. 7/10
