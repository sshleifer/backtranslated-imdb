I really liked this movie. It really puzzled me how Deanna and Alicia became friends over such a tragedy. Alicia was just a disturbed soul and Deanna was so happy to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that it was kind of slow at first and it took a while to get to the bottom of things. Despite that, it was pretty cool.
