The Haunted World by Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, it is lackluster and cheap-looking people in which they come on tangents that make it very unfocused and cohesive, but this enhances their charm. I say this because it is a documentary about an eccentric who made eccentric pictures and surrounded himself with eccentric colleagues and as such there is really no other way to document the life and career of man and his crew of misfits. There are glimpses of insights from both Wood's genius and ineptitude, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary. Overall, it's worth watching the Wood and the movie fans in general, but do not expect the glitz here. Expect a documentary made after Wood's heart.
