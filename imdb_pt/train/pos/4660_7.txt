"Hot Millions" is a well-written tale about a cheater who steals (shouts! - a very low class word for a embezzlement, according to the main character of Peter Ustinov) a "hot million" London branch a corporation of USA by creating shell corporations on the mainland and using the ostensibly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, police spoiler, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> Since 1968, the computer rendering of this movie may seem naive to today's most computer-savvy population; but as someone who has worked with computers since before the release of the film, I would say that even so, this seems to have been written by and for computer illiterates, probably on purpose to increase the comedic aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If someone has little taste for this type of entertainment, the movie may drag on some spots. Fortunately, it has a well-wrapped ending; unfortunately, the final credits give no indication of the classical music used in it - the symphonic piece at the end and the piano flute duet in the middle - just the song sung by Lulu that I do not fully remember.
