In my opinion, this is a good example of the film that could have been so much better had it been short 10 years earlier. I doubt they would benefit from modern technology, but it would have been much better if they had at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this movie can boast of the best background art and one of the best character designs. The animation is extremely smooth and realistic. For the duration of the movie, you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. He can also be proud of one of the sexiest female characters, if not the sexiest, that beets typical anime girls with ease. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad things about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment. First, plot and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure films and are really old fashioned by modern standards. Secondly, because of the length of time, this would greatly benefit the extra 20 minutes of dialogue. Finally, the scenario is not so popular at the moment. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A great alternative to another little story about Conan, the Barbarian, but not for a novel.
