"Hundstage" is Seidl's first fiction film (before that he directed great documentaries like "animal love" or "models"). Seidl has been working on this project for over 3 years, but cost only about $ 2 million. the actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who almost touched. Cinematography is also good. the whole movie is shocking and disturbing, and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and can not communicate with each other. finally I have to say that this is one of the best and most satisfying Austrian films in recent years. Please excuse my bad English. <br /> <br />
