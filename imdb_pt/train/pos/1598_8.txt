Or I love the suspension of any stereotyped plot in this movie. I have re-visited it many times and it always happens. A little too stylized for some, but I imagine any opera lover will adore. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, has huge odds with his films and his cast and almost always pays off in movies that are off the center and somehow delicious as this is. I have often wondered about Cher's lack of roles if she chose to downplay that part of her life or if she can not get enough good chewing papers. I found her an excellent actress who can withdraw to a role, like this one in particular, or be noisy and bold and fierce as in "Mask." I found the broad comic strips at times (a hair salon called "Cinderella") but this was the entire intention of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the dark tenor of the opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point requiring a knife to cut his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is Brooklyn under the moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, as is the opera. In short, a film very satisfying to all tastes, I loved the end, all gathered together as a Greek choir, each part subtly nuanced and mingling with the others, the camera drifting down the hallway, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.
