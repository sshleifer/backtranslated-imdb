A good story about following your dreams and really making an attempt to do something about them when the chance comes. Nothing was easy for Morris - he had family, job, job under other circumstances, mortgage, etc. - it was not like he could drop what he was doing and jump happily at the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I'm glad they showed their indecision, almost until he called the majors. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a good story. Although Morris really looks more like John Kruk or a Watson Mills than Quaid - alright. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job of playing the man, the teacher, the coach and the 'oldest novice' ... As someone in the same age group, I can certainly identify him with his situation. You are not too old to do what you had dreamed of as a child, but it is getting there. You have to do it sooner than the lacer. Credibly told, well edited, tagged, acted, it's good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. Good work everywhere, happy to see it happen. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would have thought the Tampa Devil Rays would have been the subject of such a good movie in the beginning?
