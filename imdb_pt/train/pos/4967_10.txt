This movie is a must for all people who like football as an art. What impresses first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. In addition to accompanying the piece as a TV broadcast, there are generous footage dedicated to accompanying individual players in the games. This anticipates the emotions and situations these men pass through as they try to attain glory. Today's TV broadcast style, so different from that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the games and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what is now history. In this movie you can see how all these factors work together in a very explicit way. In this respect, the current style of TV broadcasting has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several leading actors: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark). ), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and SÃ¡nchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This movie is not a collection of Mexico's best football plays in 1986, although most are well covered. Throughout the film, there is the stress of presenting various aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the expense of ignoring the relevant plays of the games themselves. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of what happened because of the umpires during Mexico 1986, many of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely biased towards Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account that there is an umpire and two flags, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the above mentioned make mistakes in one way or another. Football rules do not allow referees to use TV-based replays to make decisions, so in most cases, referees have to decide what they perceive. As a consequence, referees play an active role in game development. His influence can be seen in various parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film of the 1990 World Cup continuation, compared to this, is only a source of bitter disappointment. Much of this comes from the fact that he has become very involved in the game, while this film counts things from a more distant and impartial point of view.
