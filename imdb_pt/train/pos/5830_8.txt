The boys are working out of a recording studio when they hear "the voice of an angel". That would be Miss Van Doren, taking a test and going under the name of Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of her as a "radio singer." However, she expects a certain large wig, Mrs. Bixby, a friend of her father's to hire her, and then he will have to give her approval. <br /> <br /> She goes out, but in a few minutes the boys are running. amok in the studio causing havoc and having other musicians to kill them after they spoil the recording session. Finally things calm down. "Wow, we deceived them," says Moe. "Yeah, we got away too," Curly replies. <br /> <br /> The boys play in the studio, put on Miss Van Doren's album, and Curly dresses in women's clothes and pretends to be singing. Mrs. Bixby comes in, gets impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an extra $ 500, she asked to come and sing at her high society party that night. The rest, as they say, is story as Curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results. Oh by the way, he accompanied "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What happens at the party is simply that the truth wins, but not before some antics happen. All in all, a good episode. I liked it, but I would not rate it as anything special.
