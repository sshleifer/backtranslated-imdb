I think most people do not seem to have the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure if it's a drug abuse movie; on the contrary, it is a film about the way of thinking of these brothers geniuses, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it is not a commercial movie that you see every day and, if the author wanted it, it definitely failed, as most people think is one of the many drug-related films. I, however, think otherwise is the case. As in many films depicting different cultures, the public often understands the films that portray their own culture, that is, something with which they grew up and with whom they are quite familiar. This movie is to show what these "genius" people often think and what problems they face. The reason they act like this is because they are bored with anger. They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept these things as if they were launching space shuttles daily. They start a very difficult job and stand out in no time. They feel like - I went to work, did not do anything, I still did twice as good as the guys around me when they were in all their projects, which I should do now with my free time. And what is even more annoying? When you can begin to predict behavior not because you are a psychologist but because you have seen this pattern in the past. So for them, on the one hand, it's a non-challenging job, which is sometimes boring, and on the other, they begin to understand people's behavior. It's a recipe for great boredom. And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state. The earlier guy who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, it is actually absolutely right.
