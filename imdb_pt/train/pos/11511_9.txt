Weak scripts sometimes? Yes! Special effects of cheese sometimes? Yes! Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I always liked science fiction as a kid, but I found a lot of Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff crappy. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a fresh perspective on the classic monsters from Universal, and Carl Kolchak took me to the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and special guests, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had an ironic sense of humor, despite the danger, was an idealist in his quest for truth and a realist when he accepted the mandatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. Moreover, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to do what he had to do, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career, or his time in prison. Despite all his flaws, including the taste for clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and intelligence who drove a beautiful yellow Mustang (then an old used car) on its way to save the day for humanity. As good as any other fictional hero, Carl Kolchak was the hero of all men, brought to life every week for a season, thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he's gone and his show is on DVD, I hope he's enjoying himself so much watching me watch him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
