This film was extremely funny, I would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movies should see again list, I know this cast of characters, are people I've met over the years and that lead me to look for this comedy Unfortunately, this was never put on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx always a comedy clown, Pearl Baily a great game as his spirited and cheeky wife, Norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it out, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man. Miss Dobson a prostitute with a heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties this movie qualifies for a return encore, situation comedy with a mix of events like this could and should find its way as a remake, I think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible except for Jerry Seinfeld playing Dennis Dugan role, this marks a couple of episodes of Seinfeld that also brought me back to Norman is that you, holding them in the nearest was certainly impossible as impossible to reform pretend prostitute prostitute and infidelity of a parent. This movie was a wild ride advising a taxi driver, remind me of the episode Kramer takes advice from his caddy about his lawyer. (Seinfeld episode) Parents have a jaw-dropping moment, fun for fun. It's glaring to bring me back.
