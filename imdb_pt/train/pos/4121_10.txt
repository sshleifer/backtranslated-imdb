This tends to be overlooked by many critics and fans of Kurosawa, but I find it wonderful. It is an episodic study of several characters about the poorest of Tokyo, who live in a city literally made out of garbage. Although it looks like an atomic bomb, the film has a kind of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of the insane young man who drives an imaginary tram through the favela. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories fascinating, but perhaps the most tragic is the man and his young son living in an abandoned car. When they do not look for food, they spend their free time using their imaginations to build the dream house. An emotionally moving and beautiful film.
