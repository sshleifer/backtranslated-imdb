I really really like what I've seen of this cartoon so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but frankly, I'd rather see this kind of cartoony style done faster and cheaper than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply (what was starting to happen over and over times - it's just a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it). There's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black dot eyes - actually, I find it very cute. As a child I never thought Scooby-Doo's design was particularly adorable, but I think I wish it was better to know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for some depth. Of course, the show does not center around the original "Mystery-resolution" theme, but this was just an old tired formula anyway. Do not get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers out there who could attract a lot more interest in the traditional activities of Mystery Inc. (which are missing so far), but in the meantime, show is a fun diversion from the standard. Sausage and Scooby are still funny, but are no longer just a comic relief. They are still cowards but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old revelers who have eaten more than ever, but now, in fact, they seem to be giving continuity to their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's heritage. <br /> <br /> I used to find most of the original Scooby-Doo jokes. to be pure cheese and, unintentionally, hilarious, at best, but this show really exerts a real humorous capacity. Also, I've never really enjoyed Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor does not annoy me as much as other people. (I still think Billy West was the best overall) <br /> <br /> Overall, although not a great cartoon in the whole story of the cartoon, it is still an achievement among other Scooby incarnations .
