I do not remember seeing this one before tonight, probably the title seemed so common that it kept passing through me. But it's a well-crafted western, with a curiously praised plot, complemented by a performance that goes from good to rough. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum leans in the open city looking for his wife and news of his daughter, and stays for a while as city tamer. As usual, good entrepreneurs have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of bad guys, but they like the business they bring. It still applies: Relax laws about drinks and gambling and encourage industries, but pretend to deplore the obscure effects it may have on ordinary people. What's fascinating about this film is Mitchum's cynically intense portrayal of cleaning up the bandit town and the population's acceptance that their violent methods were the only ones. Little preferred: the sudden death of two of the bandits in the Red Dog salon. The firing of the main hall bordered the unpleasant, but it was an effective way of fighting the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very good movie with its only flaw tending to be a bit of corny - not so good for Do-Gooders who would probably prefer a lifetime of trading with Evil instead of ending it- it.
