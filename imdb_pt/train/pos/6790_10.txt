This game is one of the best RPG. Fist, In fact it's more fun than any other because of the battle system (you damage the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can turn into dragoon, special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. Characters are all beautiful and you do not have long dialogues to support, as happened in several games in the Final Fintasy series. I got tired of the dialogues about the past, when you just want to continue with the story of the game. The setting is a jewel in this game, combining the fantasy of the Middle Ages with futuristic science fiction. It's remarkable that animation effects are simply amazing, I like them more than others in other modern games (we can not remember that Legend of the Dragoon is 8 years old now). So the map is huge, there are all sorts of enemy places. Finally, Music is not the best music game I've ever heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
