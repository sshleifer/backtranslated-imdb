I've seen Maslin Beach a few times - both outdoors and on TV in Brisbane. I will not go into knowing if it's good, bad or otherwise, as others have well and truly covered it. <br /> <br /> I'll say you're so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a movie about relationships between people who spend the day as naked as on the day they were born and to watch it on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the United States who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV relative to their home country. Sex and the City and Huff are just too many examples. <br /> <br /> Although our government tries to make us the 51st state of the US, it is good to know that at least some things remain really Aussie.
