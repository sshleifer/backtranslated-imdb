I saw this movie only once on TV and it was not repeated. This is strange when you consider the garbage that is repeated over and over again. Usually the horror movies for me are a source of fun, but this really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE NEXT BIT IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE MOVIE YET <br /> <br /> A bit more frightening is when the town people chase the preacher as far as his wife lies almost dead (they were poisoning her). He asks who the hell you are anyway. One by one, they give their true identities. The girl who was pretending to be deaf to corrupt and seduce him, says "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve."
