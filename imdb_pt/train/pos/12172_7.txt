This movie starts fast, has a few slow moments in the middle, but usually moves well, has some very good moments, then peters at the end of Act 3. I could see this in LA premiere 2 times (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the leader of the future. He is humorous and has his own, but he is best served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role, new to her, but she does not 'steal' this movie, the way a star of her caliber should. For an actress who has so much potential (10 Things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to see her continue to play roles that are so "medium", and then she does not take the role and runs away with film (as Daniel Day- Lewis did in 'Gangs'). Selma Blair is a good young actress too, and does an ok job. I did not expect an award from her academy, and she did not turn in one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another movie that is 'above average'. Maybe the problem is in the script more than anything else. I liked this movie! But, it's not a movie you walk away from and says ... 'that was great!' ... This 'story' was made so many times before and there was not much new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the film, and Larry Miller does an incredible performance in a supporting role (he could be the best surprise of the film). If you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but unless they change the ending ... again ... quit during the church scene , or you will certainly be disappointed.
