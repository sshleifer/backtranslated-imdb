Often, movies of this nature appear as a mix of great work, along with a slight noise to fill the runtime. Whether it be the big name of the support or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm. I believe I can truly say that the film as a whole is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic final sequence, uniting the characters in a last vision of love in Paris, I think the film would have suffered if any gear had been removed. It's true that there are definitely some highlights that overshadow the rest, but in the end I have a lasting image, even if it's only a fraction of a second of each short vignette. Love takes many forms, and the talent here rises for the occasion, to amaze and move the audience through the poetry and elegance of the many facets of emotion. <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal's surprises as a cheeky drug actress filming in Paris and meeting her drug dealer. The revelation at its conclusion leaves you a bit unbalanced as the passion between the two changes hands. <br /> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recreating a relationship from an old Cassavettes movie?) Bring great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce. What their conversation is true and what is just to annoy the other, it's all nice, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Which of Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching picture of the existing love beyond religious and racial differences. It's a little shy love story between two people, obviously feeling a connection, but unable to vocalize enough. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I'll admit to being disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get an animated sequence. together, however, this tale of pampering action that falls in love in a Paris prison has the same peculiar nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: The Coen brothers adhere to their strange sense of humor and deliver some good laughs. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word. His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a disgruntled Frenchman are invaluable. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here's a poignant portrait of a couple about for love just to have him come back in the face of tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson are moving like the couple dealing with problems and discovering how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pé-Lachaise: A surprisingly funny tale of horror master Wes Craven. A little humor from Oscar Wilde can add lightness to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to be practicing the incredible long-takes that he perfects in Children of Men with this tale of two people in love, walking down the street. When Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier finally get on the scene, we also find the true context of their conversation about "forbidden love." <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: A very surreal look about the glamor of Paris. This is probably the strangest entry but so intriguing that you can not look away from the folly that follows. Do not get angry with the Asian beautician, whatever you do. <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at a relationship that is going through a dramatization that seems to have been stagnating for years. A small variety of Bob Hoskins is needed to light the fire. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Even vampires in Paris can find love between feeding hours. I do not know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not. Beautifully shot and silenced to allow the red blood vibration, this short is strange, but so is love. 14th arrondissement: Let the strange sense of humor of Alexander Payne really add some depth to this narrated story of an American in Paris to find out what love is. His hard and uneducated French is a very strong contrast to the authentic accents we have heard so far - just out of order enough to be both funny and totally true to the story. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the process. Paris can be a city insulted for everyday activities such as finding a place to park, but when love is discovered, it will get stuck anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> 16eme Loin: Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child is through her subtle performance when the story is told by her singing to a small child but totally different each time. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite tale of the group. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and how fate unites the two characters twice so that Boro finally asks for coffee is difficult to watch. Sometimes love in its final moment is enough to accept the exit from Earth. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: One of the best stories about a mother trying to deal with the death of her son. Juliette Binoche is devastating as the mother, desperate for a last glimpse of her son, and Willem Dafoe is strangely perfect as the cowboy that allows him the chance. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes you have to think he lost his love by accepting that he was not totally invested in the relationship. Melchior Beslon recalls, trying to figure out where he went wrong in a series of quick, quick cuts from his meeting with Natalie Portman to eventually "see" how much he needs her. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave to Gus Van Sant shows us a story about the communication and understanding gap, since his films almost always deal with some form of alienation. His Elephant photographer is an American who works in Paris and is the catalyst for Gaspard Ulliel's ramblings of love and soul mate. Sometimes it is not necessary to know what is being said to understand what is happening in the breaks.
