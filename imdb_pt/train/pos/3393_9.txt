The only other film besides Soylent Green that has an air of hopelessness is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for species and the planet of man-made cataclysms. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with planetary environmental poisoning. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is some optimism, because from 2007 we have not come to any of the worlds described in these films and we should have so far. New York City still has about 8 million people and not the 22 million at the turn of the millennium, as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming. For me, it also shows the ethic of the Right to Life lost. Obviously, there is no family planning in this world. Charlton Heston is a NYPD detective who lives with his roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember Earth before the catastrophe. There was a murder committed, Joseph Cotten, an executive at Soylent Corporation, a multinational concern that came up with a food product, some kind of wafer in various colors to feed the world's population. The latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> Research reveals that Charlton Heston is receiving his man, but also leads to some terrible truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind. As Heston screams in the end that Soylent Green is made up of people, we become a race of cannibals, the most horrible thing is that there is no alternative. We exhaust the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> This was Edward G. Robinson's farewell performance and in his memoirs Heston spoke touchingly of Robinson, despite having different political views. . A few weeks after Robinson ended the final scene of his death on the screen by consent to euthanasia, he passed away in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was terminal and that there was no acting involved in that final scene of death between the two. <br /> <br /> Although the schedule has been canceled, this does not mean that the world planned by Soylent Green may not come to pass. I hope we do not just have the intelligence, but the sense of shared responsibility to prevent that from happening.
