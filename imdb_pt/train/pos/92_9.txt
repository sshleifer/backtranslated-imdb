This is not an art film, it is conventional entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lots of beautiful people, t & a and action. I found it very funny. Not to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny too, which is just gravy. Definitely worth a rental. <br /> <br /> So in summary, I recommend checking for some entertainment Friday night with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it!) <br /> <br /> The villains are good too. Vinnie, Corey Large, the male guy from Heroes. Very unpleasant villains.
