This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have invaded the Balkans again, 45 years after the time portrayed. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with so much anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide if crying or laughing would be the most appropriate response. The precision of the portrait and the timelessness of the types, however, make a great film accompany it if we want to understand a little of what led the former Yugoslavia to madness. In fact, no diplomat who deals with the region should try anything until he sees this movie, and his twin brother, Maratonci trce poconi krug. Did I mention that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
