I was initially dubious about this movie (just because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous buffalo shooting scenes and the dramatic conclusion make it worth watching. At first I had difficulty distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they distinguished themselves more and more. I'm still haunted by the final scene.
