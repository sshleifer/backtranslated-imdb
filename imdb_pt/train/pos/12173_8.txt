First a quick 'shut up!' for those who say that this movie smells bad. You can not go to all the movies waiting for 'Citizen Kane'. This was really a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is, I do not think there was enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have insisted more on that. Other than that, the movie is a lot of fun. Selma Blair needs to eat something. She's worrying me. But she still looks beautiful. So yeah, I'd recommend this movie for a date or fun in the afternoon light on Saturday. Go and see. <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION: ** 1/2 of ****
