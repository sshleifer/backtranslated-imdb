<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman made metaphysical anguish popular, but this Canadian gem is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, less said about the plot, better, but let's set the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave are together since childhood, they can not deal with the world and it means that they no longer have to. But that's where even more trouble starts. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile a lot after the final credits and this is a rare experience with so many mass-produced pieces of "nothing" out there. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. <br /> <br />
