"The Navy of this Man" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at the Navy's activities lighter than air (LTA). The LTA crews were proud that the trains that followed never lost a ship to an underwater attack. And filming in the various NAS locations gives a valuable glimpse of an aviation type that has long passed. However, the first half of the film is about Beery, his relationship with his service friends, and he meets the character of Tom Drake and his mother, and fixes Drake's leg. Only then does the second movie begin. The second movie is mostly LTAs in action, picking up a submarine on the surface, guys are dead and a lot of damage is done. The look is quite brave and realistic, I imagine. So we moved to Southeast Asia. Had the Navy had LTAs there? No matter, this part is really wild, with a balloon being used to extract some crews from the jungle. And the Japanese are shooting like crazy. Shadows of Vietnam except the escape is oh, so slow. This is a balloon we're talking about. In the end, a WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
