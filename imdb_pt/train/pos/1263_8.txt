I liked this movie because it's mainly because I like to see Sean Connery take action and this one has the added bonus of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne as well. The story has a grandmother who seeks help from Connery because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted. At first it seems that there may have been some racist aspects of the case, however, later the main officer of the case was black and it seems that he did some bad things to coerce a confession of the boy. Well, the boy tries to point to another murderer trapped in the same prison, the one about to be put to death. He is also a particularly unpleasant person, for he is very pleased with what he did, writing the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to mail them. A lot of twists and turns in this with a bit of something unexpected. I just liked the character of Sean Connery trying to understand the whole ordeal. The movie also drove me crazy in areas, especially when you find out what happened. You have a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne because they all shine very well on this one. In the end, this is a good suspense / suspense.
