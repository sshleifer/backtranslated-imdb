I think it's a good movie; I think it's a very Romanian film through the scene and atmoshpere; I think it was not intentional (sensuality is a result, not a purpose); I think it's very natural; I think it's human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never made me think ... waw lame acting (they are not Sean Connory & co) nor the movie is a block buster, they are like the movie ... normal ppl that can act ...; I think the movie has hit its mark; I think it made me feel things (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really liked it ... I know.
