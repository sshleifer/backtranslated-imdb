This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you stop pretending you know or care about what communism was and how Russian or British are real, if you accept and do not bother with the conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid being completely shaded by Nicole, and the rest of the cast also does a good job. The final is moving and logical - film logic, of course. Worth watching if you accept the rules of the game.
