House of Games is a wonderful multi-level movie. It's a beautiful mystery and a shocking thriller. He is blessed with wonderful performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong and strong cast of supporting players, and features Ricky Jay, an extraordinarily keen, conjurer and magic historian. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken like a game of manners and gives the film (in which reality is often questioned) an extra dimension of unreality. Faced with this, House of Games is a compelling glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con artists, diametrically different from The Sting, which was touched only by glamor and yuks. At this level, she has admirable success. <br /> <br /> However, you can not escape the exam at a deeper level of a woman's odyssey, of professional competence complacent to incredible strength and self-fulfillment. The only film I know about the emergence of personal strength in a woman in a dignified way is the underestimated soldier Benjamin. This thoroughly enjoyable film, unfortunately, spreads its focus, jumping between various themes and exploring the good performance of Goldie Hawn to chase a few easy laughs. House of Games keeps your business going. As Poe once said about a good tale, this leads ruthlessly to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> There's another lineup of women's movies, synthesized by Thelma and Louise, a big budget money maker. contemptible subject that women are doomed, or do not realize their internal strengths. What a gut. <br /> <br /> As usual, you really should see this movie in a movie theater. It should be natural for film festivals. Refer to one near you if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original House of Games version and delivered it to my 23 year old daughter. Better she should see it on a television than not at all.
