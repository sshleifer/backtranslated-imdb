{Possible spoilers coming ... you've been warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and music films! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes the brightness (not to mention the songs) of a show is lost in its transition from stage to screen. That is for the most part definitely not the case here. <br /> <br /> The scenarios are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can not help but love them, and Michael Kidd choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​happy to hear they used the original Broadway choreographer) All actors "bring the ball back" to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owner of the oldest permanent floating trash set established in New York, and the most notorious gambler who bets even on the tiniest things - like his fever reaching 104 if he does not accept penicillin. Jean Simmons, sweet and fresh-faced, is perfect for the role of Sarah (although true, her songs are not as remarkable as those of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the mission doll with a heart of gold and an impulse to heal everything. And last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is Miss. Vivian Blaine, reprizing her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - the Hot Box dancer and singer who would like to finally end her 14-year engagement with Nathan and get rid of the psychosomatic cold he gave her. <br /> <br /> First, compliments to Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley as they reprise their Broadway roles as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two more amiable players than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is superb as usual, and although he does not have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget - how he has that sense of determination to bring everything he can to his role such as Sky Masterson. "Luck be a lady" gives me shivers every time I see him do the number. Especially nice is to hear him say "Dad ... I have cider in my ear". <br /> Simmons is charming and pleasing in a role well suited to her appearance, voice and the way she behaves. You have plenty of time for her not only to conquer Heaven (or ultimately to believe in Him), but also to help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins, and to live a life with God. Your version of "If I Were A Bell" is splendid, to say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He's so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings excerpts that Sam Levene from the Broadway cast never got (great actor, but the guy was deaf ... go there). I really enjoyed the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... I wanted a guy to sing like that for me. Frankie's cool, smooth behavior transcends the limits of this film. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just an absolute perfection in that role. From the accent to her "Adelaide's Lament", she is simply fantastic. And she's also my favorite part of the whole movie. She really makes you feel for Adelaide ... especially when she cries before and after again during "Sue Me". I still have not decided if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... maybe I like them alike. Either way, she does a fantastic with those as well as "Take Back Your Mink". (I'm sad they left out "hollanderize" the movie ...) She's absolutely wonderful, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is its language. It's a mix of high class and street slang. They never use "It", "I" or "That is." It's always "Yeah," "I go," and "That's it." Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals, and it's one that you should take time to watch every time you show up. My only complaint? Do not "marry man today." Now this is good music.
