STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Among ** Late behind * The Wells * Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he sees a group of men mistreating a lady. Being a gentleman, he naturally comes into the picture and puts an end to it and, in so doing, kills the son of a malicious agent. This is just the beginning of a battle of all weapons until the end, of which there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who never managed to take off with me. Maybe I discovered him too late and after the other film I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have a crush on Westerns, being movies that kind of transport me to a different time and place and provide a true escapist entertainment, and with that, Dudikoff chose one of his best scripts, as well as his films. The film hits some lows in the form of a central naff villain, sounding like a blank Marlon Brando and some actors usually acting in some parts of the cast, along with seemingly cheap ensembles mandatory. But if, for some strange reason, your life depends on watching a Dudikoff movie, that would be one of your best choices. ***
