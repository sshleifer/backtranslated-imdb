I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was very good ... a tragic love story! I really liked the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically deficient. The love that developed between this character and the woman who comes into your life portrayed very well how I would like to think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 years old when she made this movie ... was great, since the woman so full of life is able to revive the heart of this guy. Unfortunately, since her family is rich and she is not, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> He's playing HBO a few more times this month.
