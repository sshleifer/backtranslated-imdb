It's hard to say more about this movie without ruining everything. I liked it because I was not expecting what I was seeing, but a common sexual drama, so ... It's a psycho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems. It features Emmanuelle Seigner, not strange to the genre (and nudity) in which her husband, Polanski, drove her. And a chilling performance (I said scary / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier's actor). It seems that a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), as a lost Chabrol or Clouzot thriller (I saw someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to Les Yeux sans Visage by Georges Franju (Faceless Eyes, Godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). A jewel! I'm just afraid they'll turn it into a Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
