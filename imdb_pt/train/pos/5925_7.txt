Because of all the negative reviews of this movie I almost did not watch. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a rather nice horror film. The acting was not great - besides the wonderful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogues ("Just consider lunch") were quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> Overall, a Stephen King effort above average - 7/10
