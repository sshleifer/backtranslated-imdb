I saw this movie once in or near its release year 36 years ago (1969). Although now I can only remember a few parts, I wish to see it again. The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sexual favors in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him. The soundtrack was especially memorable and the excitement stirred in the league of Gone With The Wind and I would love to hear it again. There must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt it has anything to do with lack of quality or interest.
