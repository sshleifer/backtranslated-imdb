What can you say about Elvira that has not been said in the world press? The classic comedy that Ã‰vi Elvira offers in her first great comedy masterpiece of big budget. Since the first movie scene, Elvira plays a role that clearly says Film Great .... eat your heart out, Bette Davis! See a helpless Elvira, see an excited Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see an assassin Elvira. You can do nothing but marvel at your acting prowess! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira's desire for Las Vegas to show stardom. Despite putting "bosom back into the boobtube" as a hostess of horror (with the largest number), Elvira finds the little canvas emotionally constrictive ... and PHYSICALLY! Nuff said, she packs her backpack and heads east ... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer outlining her "unexpected" inheritance in the other. <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it verbatim .... (verbatim would just be showing)! <br /> <br /> Take a copy, laugh silly, learn the lines .... <br /> <br /> Why she did not win the Oscar for Best Actress for that role is beyond me.
