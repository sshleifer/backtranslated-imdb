The opening night of John Cassavetes is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have in our imagination, fascinating because it never ceases to amaze us. With its long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates characters will not be able to take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon, (Gena Rowlands) trying to unite for a play, fighting her demons; "Opening Night" is not just about a woman on the brink of collapse, but also about the complexities of the lives of the theater actors and the theatrical world. All of Cassavetes' characters are experienced people who know the world of theater; so half the film takes place on a stage, where artists do their work or behind the scenes, where producers, writers and directors do their work. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so hard on his characters that this cruelty goes back to the public but the audience in the movies. Because there are other audiences in the movie theater who do not know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance. And that is essentially what it is; it's just that audiences in the theater can not see 'behind the scenes' the way we do. They do not experience the exuberance of Gena Rowlands before she leaves for this stage, but more importantly; they do not know the reasons why it acts the way it does. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she's an actress and it's the only thing she knows how to do; and I imagine that if I had a friend who was a professional artist, it would be really hard to tell when he's telling the truth because I'd know he's an actor and he can fake anything at any time. Many of the things that Myrtle does during the terrible experiences the movie does with her? "We suspect she's being real; the rest of the characters also suspect. <br /> <br /> There is writer Sarah (Joan Blondell) who can not understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she wrote to her. There is the director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept the fact that his best actress may be losing; producer David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where to stay and Myrtle's co-star, Maurice (Cassavetes himself), who can not handle their love for each other. <br /> <br /> When she witnesses the death of a teenager, a fan; all this comes together and affects Myrtle, but no one knows if his illusions are real. They do not say anything because they do not want to upset her, but the film enters a state of subconsciousness that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can say that everyone already had. During these moments, Cassavetes' brilliant script portrays a frightening and brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a backstage discussion; and not just what everyone says to Myrtle, but also what she says to them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to say what they think and constantly change what they are thinking, as well as the way of making movies of Cassavetes. . And in this respect, the performances are more important here than in "Shadows", because the characters are involved in a larger image; a larger story that comes out of the trivial. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way of making movies, this movie is no different from "Shadows". There is a beautiful thing in the way the Al Ruban camera shoots the characters. When someone is talking, the camera does not focus on it, it shoots the person who is listening; so that we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other is saying. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation can still be there among all these wonderful performances. Towards the end, there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands start talking nonstop. Whether this was improvised or not is not something we should ask ourselves. We just have to watch; and seeing the two exchanging experiences of life and seeing the words become really alive in a conversation that means much more than what it shows. It does not look more natural than that.
