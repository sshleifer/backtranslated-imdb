I settled in to watch "Read My Lips," a plate of Freedom Fries before me. The food was quickly forgotten as I was absorbed by the superb and superb thriller of director and co-writer Jacques Audiard. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary at a company that develops major construction projects. In fact, she has some significant responsibilities that do not usually fall on the desks and she is capable and ambitious. And frustrated by a male hierarchy that will exploit it, but not reward it. <br /> <br /> Work piling up faster than she can handle, and Carla is advised to hire a secretary. Enter ex-convict and General Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his abilities and does not actually have any that any legitimate company might require. After a serious initial misunderstanding on Paul's part of Carla's interest in him, the two became allies. A peculiar friendship begins. In a feat that would make Carla a great candidate in "The Apprentice," she overcomes her selfish male adversary in working with Paul's connivance. Get out of the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. With this, she listens almost normally. It turns off the hearing aid to isolate itself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She is also very lonely. A heroic make-up effort was made to make it look simple, but she's really beautiful. She does not have a boyfriend. She takes care of a friend to have a call (it's a French movie) Worse and humiliating, she accepts the appeal of a girlfriend who walks somewhere while her married friend loves him with her lover in Carla's bed. It is not good. <br /> <br /> When Carla and Paul know each other better, the bad side of the criminal is not so old. There is a side story, by the way, of Paul's relationship with his probation officer, which complements the main plot and has its own amazing grand finale. "Read My Lips?" The ingenious Paul acknowledges that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the fun hall trick that seems to be the first. <br /> <br /> From there, a caper develops. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a veritable couple of eccentric criminals. She wants love, but she also accepts money. He wants her, more or less, but business must come before the possible erotic satiation. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who carry an unusual crime tale to the very very convincing end. <br /> <br /> Rent or buy, but if you like a good crime story, you'll choose "Read My Lips". And you may well want to watch it several times: I do. <br /> <br /> 9/10
