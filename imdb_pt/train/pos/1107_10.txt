In the classical sense of the four humors (which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertaining), "H.E.A.L.T.H." of Altman treats all moods and, in fact, fun and fun ways. There is the Phlegm, personified by the very slow, reserved and protective character of Lauren Bacall, Esther Brill, whose mission in life seems to be all about appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There is the choleric of Paul Dooley, Dr. Gil Gainey, who, like a fish out of water (perhaps more like a seal), frantically floats, barking and exhorting the crowd to accept their aquatic madness. The melancholy of Isabella Garnell, by Glenda Jackson, looks like a disturbed and hypocritical Hamlet of Shakespeare - even presenting a soliloquy or two. And let's not forget the character Bile of Henry Gibson, Bobby Hammer ("The breast that feeds the baby rules the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively healthy characters who strive to find some sort of balance between all the mates and extreme moods that have gathered for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., which is anything but health. This is Altman in his best classic.
