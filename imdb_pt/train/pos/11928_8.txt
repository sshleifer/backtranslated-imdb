This film, although apparently based on a film of the same title in 1951, released by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover, in one of his best performances, gives life to George Knox, a lucky baseball entrepreneur with an explosive temperament. As for this film to be "stacked up," what about adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage works and concerts on his screen performances, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock of the Sun), Brenda Fricker (yes, even he's good in this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be as fundamental in this film but he was exposed), Adrien Brody what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien except the Dazed and Confused part), some great actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Wilder Ranch), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and an experienced veteran in one of his latest performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of the California Angels) and the rest of the cast do a great job, plus a great plot that is edifying for a beautiful lot of people, myself I do not care about the recesses of depression in which you st I loved film as a child, and brings back memories when I watch today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to any parent who is looking for something that their children have not seen, and everyone else.
