One of my favorite movies for several years was "Last Action Hero"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to ruin my amusement by becoming a corrupt and despicable politician; so now I can not stand any movie where he might have had a hand. <br /> <br /> The Adventures of Jake Speed ​​actually plays with some themes similar to those of the last one ... Hero; so I was happy to find it on DVD so I could watch those songs as well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot within the plot" involving white slavery during the civil war of an African nation, this is not an action movie. The plot that the "plot within a plot" is inside, is in fact an issue that the movie has no intention of solving: Jake Speed ​​is a real person who is helping the heroine save his sister from the white slave trader ? ; or is it really a fictional character (which means that heroin somehow entered the universe that actually only exists in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest that this is not all clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the public may want from a fictional universe of "adventure story." In fact, this is a rich subject, whose potential weight is relieved by the film's friendly and exaggerated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The film has weak points - mainly cinematography, which makes the film look like a TV. exhibition. And the beat falls sometimes. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters and I like the adventure they live, no matter how silly. And I just find it fascinating to the idea that this adventure is really going on in a novel. <br /> <br /> Hold on multiple views - good show!
