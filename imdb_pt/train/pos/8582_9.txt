Love the characters and the plot. Very funny with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I liked the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very nice and surprisingly supportive killer. All three actors are among my favorites and have them in this movie made for a special treat. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, Confidential L., The Long Kiss of Good Night, The Abyss, and The Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
