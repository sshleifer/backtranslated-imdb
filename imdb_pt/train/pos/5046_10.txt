There is such rubbish in the cable film channels that I hit a gem with this one. From beginning to end, I clung and deserve the best grades. <br /> <br /> The father of two children hears messages from "God" to kill people who say they are "demons". <br /> <br /> When opening credits have shown the director as one of the actors that can often be a warning of a bad movie; exceptionally, is the reverse here, for the drama is uninterrupted from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And there is not a moment in the movie where someone is not totally captivated, as there are no unnecessary or unnecessary substitutes. plots, and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All actors give totally convincing performances, especially the leading actor who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is as good as the 'Silence of the Lambs'.
