The first of Ghibli's official films, Laputa is more similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but considering that Nausicaa was a science fiction epic, this is another comedy-adventure action with a rather weak SF premise. <br /> <br /> The first half hour of the movie I thought I would love. Once again, you will be amazed by Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to create an imaginary world with meticulous and beautiful perfection. The animation, although not yet in the league of the latest Ghibli films, is a bit better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in my commentary on Nausicaa that a character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesco' anime. style. Here are a bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element of the movie, though that's why it needs a comic element that I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better for him. Still. Having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the movie (even though she is basically a Long John Silver woman. Do not be surprised if you remember 'Treasure Planet' sometimes) and is well dubbed by Cloris Leachman on the American dub. <br /> <br /> The voice of the English is successful most of the time, in fact. However, something started pear-shaped for me about this movie about half way. I think the best way I could describe it is that the characters are swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to this later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire in Laputa, and many people obviously love this, that I almost feel bad for giving only 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is "to admire". It was more impressive than personally affecting, and in more than two hours he just started to crawl. <br /> <br /> The bottom line for me was this: I really did not think I cared much about any of the characters. . Disney would have taken care to develop the characters, make you really fall in love with them, instead of leaving them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved while you gape at the incredible views of the movie. Even this would have been tolerable if there had been some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls as far as I'm concerned, and that's what keeps it from being a potential 10 out of 10 movies. Having said that, it should be admitted that Miyazaki was ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that the same year's film was the terrible 'Great Detective Mouse'. <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie, in a way, an incredible movie, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it is overrated. I definitely prefer the "Nausicaa from the Wind Valley" earlier. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you can watch them in chronological order, watch the fox squirrel of Nausicaa appear briefly in Laputa.
