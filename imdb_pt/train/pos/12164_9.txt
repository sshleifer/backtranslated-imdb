In a year of pretentious stridency like "Sin√©doque, New York," a film born of Charlie Kaufman's self-indulgence, comes a film that is equally hard to watch, but about three times as important. "Frownland" is a love work by the team, the actors and the filmmaker, filmed over the years by friends. He traces a man who can not communicate through his authentic and real world of Brooklyn. The people you see are a step beyond the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, incapable. The real world for them is their own set of delusions and because this is a movie about people who are so deeply out of touch, it is very difficult to watch. It is making 16mm cinema without adequate light, money or any of the other factors that would make the film "smooth", but its honesty can not be underestimated, a fact that would make a room full of people dismiss it and by Richard Linklater to give a prize like he did at SXSW. This resembles movies like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It's a movie that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grow in you the more you think about it.
