To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was when I started. This is how I watch movies whenever possible. No bias. I thought this would be a movie about junkies in the woods or something. I was wrong, kind of. <br /> <br /> Loaded was kind of boring at first, but once it started getting really addicted. I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous, where you feel powerless, but doing things you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer commented on how silly and implausible this movie was, but I disagree. These kinds of things happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". I'm really sorry, but the reality of the world is that they happen. The creator of this film, as well as the actors, did a great job portraying how things can go wrong and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things get good, sometimes they end up bad and such is life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
