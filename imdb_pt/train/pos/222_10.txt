A hilarious comedy by Neil Simon that evokes laughter from start to finish. The late Walter Matthau is the ex-comedian comedian who is persuaded to team up with his ex-partner (George Burns) for a final show on the stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's grumpy character - he's exactly the same as always, and also very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like the distracted old man, is as funny as Matthau. Matthau: Do you want some cookies? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How about a simple cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not simple. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Ok <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the kitchen closet. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe Later. <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I made black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> In all, a pleasantly hilarious, sweet, heartfelt, warm and lovely comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable phrases of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not do it any more! In a time when all new comedies are rude, juvenile and stupid, this turns to the tender core of what comedy really is-funny characters, clever and funny dialogues, and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> From the best friends comedies of all time, up there with "Airplanes, Trains and Cars", "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way." <br /> <br /> You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
