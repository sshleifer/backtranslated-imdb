I immediately realized that this movie was not based on Dodie Smith's novel. Anyway, it was a good idea that the son of Pongo and Perdita now had his own cubs. The sweetest of the Dalmatians was, of course, the little Snowball, which was completely untainted by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have completely changed. In fact, I always thought about the possibility of her becoming friendly, but now that she quickly became "herself" again and announced that it was Cruella once more, I almost started to get really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians. In fact, the scene where the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had dinner, was much better than I'd expected. I also liked the parrot playing as a dog, and it was amazing that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I was glad that in the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would like to know what would happen to Cruella after she had lost all her property. And what the hell would the dog house do with such a large sum of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was quite touching that Snowball also had points at the end of the movie.
