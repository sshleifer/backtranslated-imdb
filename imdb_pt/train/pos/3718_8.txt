That was a good movie. It was not your typical war movie, but something a little different. This movie showed us conscripts in pre-war training and not actually fighting in a war. This film is one of the more realistic views on the war and the army than most other films like this did. Colin Farrel did a great job portraying an Army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well. Seeing Colin Farrel change from b degree to a degree in a few years, you never thought this would happen. I will also add that the creators of the tiger did a great job filming a movie in the year 2000 and making 1970 a good touch. It is good to see the talent used wisely and hope to see that same talent again in the near future.
