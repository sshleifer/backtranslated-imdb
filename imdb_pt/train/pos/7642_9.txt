Not really a big box office tie, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. James "I did some things for Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-wrote and directed this film about a normal and ordinary guy named Larry Burrows, who thinks that his life would have been <br /> < > incredibly different if he did a homerun in a key baseball game when he was 15 years old. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender Mike, Larry gets his wish but soon realizes that his new life is not exactly as he hoped it was. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie really impressed me. Critics have mixed it, and I must say that the concept is really interesting and well-arranged. Yes, it's a little average, but it packs quite a few fun moments, drama and excellent acting to make it really good. James Belushi (I think) was Oscar worthy of his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton, plus Renee Russo, shine in their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender. It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen it, I highly recommend that you check
