I was not expecting much from this movie. I received a ticket for an advanced view. I had just gotten off work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed to be no cold air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once sitting in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie began. , I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the film was perfect. From the beginning I was consumed with the film, getting more and more excited with each passing minute. I think this movie is meant to be a fantasy / fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the rhythm was perfect and the ending was magical.
