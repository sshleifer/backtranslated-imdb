This is an excellent film with a stellar cast and some great acting. I never get tired of watching. I particularly love the scene where the character of Danny Glover and the character of Kevin Kline, Simon and Mack, have a brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his mannerisms are easy and that you would find often. So it's a very "real" movie. One of the most powerful scenes of the film, however, is at the beginning of the film, when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car is broken. The film also has a strong message and is different from the stereotypical message that carries the film, where there is a person preaching their guts to an audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of the actors convey a tax message that improves without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is as brilliant as ever.
