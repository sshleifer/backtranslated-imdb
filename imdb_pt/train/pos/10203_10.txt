I love the movies and I own the comics, the comics are different from the movie, but I still would: 10 out of 10. It was incredible. If the films were more impressive. I would have your babies. And I'm a woman. Read the comics you will not regret. Yes, in this film since Brian P. the artist has died, we do not have nearly as good artwork. I mean, seriously, do not get me wrong, these people made great, but different versions for different people. Different strokes for different people, as the saying goes. Any guy who does not go mad with her is insane, or does not like women, or you know you plan insane. If I could count on my fingers how in love and how many times I read the comics I would be without fingers, of course, but there are always fingers.
