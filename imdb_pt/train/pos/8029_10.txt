I'm curious about which rifle Beckett was using in the film, and also the caliber of the bullet he was supposed to be firing. If this is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I'm guessing it's a 7mm. return. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. He also made a commentary on Sniper's latest movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese allowed him to use and that belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I'd like to know which rifle it is. I know this particular rifle was made around World War II or beforehand. I could not get close enough to see the movie to identify it. <br /> <br /> As for Hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed and 14 unconfirmed. Woods. After his somewhat healed wounds from being burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching USMC snipers the skills they would need on the field. His sniper career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters who train at the USMC. I discovered his name from my friend who is a former Marine. Any information would be great.
