Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General of the Tsar of Russia who met there. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as a general who, ironically, is part of a silent picture as a Russian general. The film recalls his days in Russia that led to the downfall of the country for the revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big screen debut as the Hollywood director who launches Jannings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and in an imitation of Tinseltown behind the scenes in the early days. Von Sternberg offers yet another classic and full of great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
