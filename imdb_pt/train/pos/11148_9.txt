'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release in 1969. There are some scenes in which you can understand this, just a little bit. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York to become a cheater is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed like a cowboy, he tries to live like a cheater, earning money for the act of loving. It does not work as he planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) pulled a trick on him and stole some money, they became friends. They live in an empty and very filthy apartment. So Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably rated X for the main subject, but on the way we see some strange things. The editing of this movie is great. We see sequences of dreams of Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a pleasant and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances. Especially Hoffman offers some beautiful famous lines. The score is made by John Barry and looks great. All this makes this a great movie that won the Oscar for Best Film for good reason.
