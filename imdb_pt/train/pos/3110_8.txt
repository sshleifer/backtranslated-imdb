The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is missing a bit in the history department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi, in particular, take part in the runtime and makes this movie better. The director and star (Damon) agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the latter part because the end of the second film was quite ... advanced in history. How did they get around this? The action scenes for once, but they did something else too, which I can not reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you'll notice! Interestingly, I read that this adaptation of Bourne's books is the least accurate of the three films ... if it means anything to you: o)
