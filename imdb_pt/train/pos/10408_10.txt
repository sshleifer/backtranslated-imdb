I saw this movie for the first time as a child and fell in love immediately. The sets are breathtaking and part of the script is very hilarious: "You, children of a thousand fleas". <br /> <br /> It's always shown on TV late at night or early in the morning I woke up around 3:00 in the morning once and had just started. TV companies need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time on Sunday, so everyone can have the chance to see that beautiful job. <br /> <br /> 10/10
