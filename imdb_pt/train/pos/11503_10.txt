Kolchak is pure fun. Great stories and a great cast and nothing more to regret. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that draws the audience along with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage, and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support most lead actors can only dream about. Some excellent invited stars add color and excitement to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how a childhood spent watching Kolchak took Chris Carter to create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
