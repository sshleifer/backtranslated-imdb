Wonderful movie, one of the best horror movies of the 70s. It is realistic settings and atmospheres. As usual, the usual negative comments were inevitable. I have noticed that most horror films of a certain period often fail to achieve sufficiency. Obviously, because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati, it's like a mental mechanism that moves the mind of the potential of music critics here. <br /> <br /> Before reading the review, I knew what the final judgment was. In the movie a good gift because 10 is really well done. Raines reads very well and the film as a way of producing reminds me of many Kubrick films. It really impresses. Great movie really. I consider it an anthology of 1970s movies.
