I've seen this movie on several different occasions. I think one of the funniest things to do is watch the reactions of the different types of people who will see you. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. A lot of old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be an honest-to-kind Samurai movie with lots of sword fighting and Japanese medieval dialogue. As the two protagonists begin to debate horror films as they swear almost randomly throughout their sentences, the old men go out, usually angry. <br /> <br /> Type 2: MOVIE SNOBS. These people think that just because a movie has the label "Independent" will automatically be a super-emotional crap load that may or may not be in English. However, they come anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people think they are intelligent and cultured. They are really in for a surprise when they see this movie. As blood begins to squirm exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the indifferent villain over-the-top holds a dog with its beast during a telephone conversation, these people will be so discouraged to leave. Some will just stay to see "how bad this is going to get" and later they will talk about what a horrible movie was for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE LIVE ANIMATION OR SPECIAL EFFECTS WITHOUT MATRIX. Sorry guys, the martial arts are pretty solid in the movie, but director Yamasato really has no budget for that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS. These are the people who really like the movie. If they only heard of Samurai Blood, randomly chose, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic mist, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and enjoy the movie for what it ultimately is: ENTERTAINMENT. This film was not meant to clarify or elicit a deep spiritual thought, it meant (if I could lend a line of dialogue to the film) to "really kick some asses". And that's what it does. <br /> <br /> So, depending on the type of person you are, you may or may not like this movie; however, if you enjoy the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and remember to bring your friends.
