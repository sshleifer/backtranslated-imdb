This is definitely one of the best stand-up shows. EVER. Eddie's so off the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years, and it still happens every time. Just everything, from his large, ample physical comedy to the small observations on the side of the head, is a masterpeice. You need look no further than this line "The word grass. You say erb, and we say grass, because there is a good thing in it." Bright.
