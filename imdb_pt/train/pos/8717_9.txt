I have to admit right away, I'm not a big fan of "family" movies these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap. But this, like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar movie, is a lot of fun. The two protagonists were perhaps a little bland (especially compared to the two protagonists of ANTZ, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it. The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good (I especially liked Hopper's phrase: "If I had not promised the mother on her deathbed that I would not kill you, I would kill you!"), And the actors making the voices, except the two, was fantastic (Denis Leary doing an animated film; what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has the new ones.
