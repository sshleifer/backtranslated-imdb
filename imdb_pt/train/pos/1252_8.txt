The endless limits of our inhumanity to our own species never cease to dazzle me. This truly amazing story of a terribly abused and largely unknown population is compelling, well documented and infuriated. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country and this is just one more in our long catalog of international degradation. We're shit This is probably John Pilger's first documentary I saw, but it immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this farce and the terrible collaboration of the US and UK governments, requires us spectators / citizens to be accomplices of our inaction ... but makes no suggestion of how to help. I do not know Britain, but the United States made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in the actions of their government. A gesture in the right direction can help the cause of these islets.
