For a long time, it seemed that all the good Canadian actors had headed south to the border, and (I imagined) all the second places filled the top positions and left the rubbish for the sex comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: in spite of the strange plots that are typical of the farces, the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we, the viewer, received back was almost the true suspension of belief. When the extras in the video clip attacked the eviction police, you almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sex farces (Canadian or otherwise), you should definitely look for it. Out. And to the great surprise, this sexual farce is also loaded with very good nudity.
