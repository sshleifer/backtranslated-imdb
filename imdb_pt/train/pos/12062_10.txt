This movie has scared me since the first day I saw him. <br /> <br /> My mother watched when she was on television in 1992. I remember waking up in the middle of the night for her tearful ramblings as my father helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She was saying something like "Do not let her get me" or something like that. I asked what made her so upset and she told me she was watching The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> So obviously I had to watch and even though I was only eleven, she left me. That scared me. I've been immune to horror movies ever since I watched this!
