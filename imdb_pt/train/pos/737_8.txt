It's incredible that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, No. 1 fan of punk rock band Ramones at Rock 'n' Roll High School. Soles is so lush, you do not care that she's obviously too old to still be in high school (this fact is leveled by having all kids look 24). The film is a fast-paced joke that does not take time out; everything gets blown apart in the end, and that's how it should be. Mary Woronov, a naively perverted and funny presence as the Nazi director, wins a big and unique at the beginning, where Frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes they use in that, or was it a fluke?) And Dey Young is very attractive as the best of Soles, Kate Rambeau. The weaker link, ironically, in this "High School" chain is the Ramones. They can not act, they are not funny and their segment of shows continues for a long time. A Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is treated like a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare Paul McCartney ballad heard near the beginning ("Have we met somewhere before?"). Great fun! *** in ****
