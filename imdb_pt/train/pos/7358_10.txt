One of the most provocative films of all time, with excellent cinematography backed by Mc Clarens, and impressive quote "Do you believe in love on the first site?". <br /> <br /> A trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, below. catapulting the integrity of flawless movies. Gabby (AKA Joey), played by Eva Longoria, clearly loved the film and the role it played so much that neither bothered to mention it in its filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> the best part of the movie would have to be undoubtedly the heroic rescue by MC Clure as he saved the young 'Handicapped' kid with the speech impediment .. What I can add was acted with perfection! James Cahiil's use of sound effects is second to none. The drug seizure he performs at the beginning of the film is a realistic pain. When I first watched this movie, I was so compelled by the intense lack of respect for the Intersted Gangs Southside and the CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far one of the most encapsulating cracks Cahill has committed to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally, this movie has sentimental value to me and I'm going to download it in the near future. That's if I can find you anywhere, LOL!
