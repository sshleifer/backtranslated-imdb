I found 'Still Crazy' wonderfully entertaining, and not just for those of us who lived through that raucous era of the late '60s, early' 70s, rock. My 15 year old daughter watches with me every time I pull the DVD (do not worry, it's only been three times) and she also loves it. <br /> <br /> It's a truly pungent and hilarious love nod to the era, and each actor beats his notes to perfection. It was my first performance to Bill Nighy and I'm happy to turn a little bit similar in 'Love Actually' brought you more attention. Bruce Robinson was amazing as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the stereotype of drug-damaged rocker. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a great name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie, I met Billy Connolly at the local mall (he used to live here at the time) and told him it was one of my five movies favorite of all time. He invited me to sit in the food court with him and we discussed the movie for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before we dismissed it wisely. Why mess with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it was not very popular in theaters and many people have missed a wonderful experience.
