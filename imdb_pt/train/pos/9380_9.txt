A lovely old-fashioned thriller popping up as a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, "Red Rock West" follows the misadventures of veteran unemployed oil worker Mr. N.Cage as his fate turns from bad to worse after he wipes out a Tank of empty gas and little money for a cup of coffee in a little town on the far side. It was established from the outset that Mr. Cage may be on the low, but he is not out, and he may be bankrupt, but he will not steal, not even in his current terrible circumstances.Consequently, when he is confused by Mr. JT Walsh by the man he commissioned to murder his wife, Mr. Cage calls his wife to warn her of her husband's intentions. In her turn, Miss LFBoyle offers her even more money to murder Mr. Walsh. decides to leave while he is still in the lead, but as he is heading out of town, he hits a man on the road. Trying as he might be to drive, he takes the man to the hospital where he happens to have been shot. Mr. Cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be Mr. JTWalsh. The events take an even more complicated course when, escaping from custody, Mr.Cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real killer on his way to fulfill his commission. Now you may be forgiven for thinking "already," but as it happens on the screen it looks like a completely logical turn of events, the narrative flow of the movie at this point seems unstoppable. Mr. Hopper is comfortably scaled-in as the killer, such as Mr. Cage, a veteran of the USMC. This little accident keeps Mr. Cage alive long enough to think of the killer trio and survive, a little more mistreated, but still untouched. It is a tribute to all involved that what sounds on paper notably as absurd is in fact an exceptionally well done portrait with excellent performances at all times. "Red Rock West" is the movie of a movie lover. In five minutes you know you're going somewhere you've been before on many occasions, but you'll be very happy on the trip.
