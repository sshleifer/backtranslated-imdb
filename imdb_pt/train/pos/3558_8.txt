Along with the South Pacific, the boys and dolls are for adults - it's sassy, ​​sexy and full of men being men and women tied up. <br /> <br /> There is an energy and an impulse that make it happen. stand out from the group - the strength of Jean Simmond's performance, the charm of a young Brando and the already talented Sinatra adds much to the overall feel of the play. <br /> <br /> Win and Doll wins as it is without shame what it is: an MGM musical. Still good to look and listen too with great melodies and dance numbers - it will remain one of the 20th century cinema classics and will be watched with pleasure for years to come. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
