I just can not believe these games can get much better, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but despite having won, I can not wait to buy it for the PS2. This is the only series of games that I must possess all of them, even though I have beaten them many times. I hope they never stop doing this kind of game, even if the series has to end. <br /> <br />
