"Gandhi as husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. 'Gandhi ... my father' is a story few would have known in such details. Certainly a vision of Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed the film for story and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah did a good job. Most of the movie scenes would be good wallpapers ... commendable work. Traditional Indian folk music as background soundtrack during certain parts of the film gives a good idea of ​​the events. <br /> <br /> However, what I did not quite like was the narration style. At various points, I found the tone super-dramatized. <br /> <br /> Overall, good work from Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "must-watch-once". 8/10
