We always watch American movies with their region-specific accents (South, West, etc). We have the same here. All foreigners must watch this film and need to have an open mind to accept another culture, in addition to Americans and Europeans almost dominate the film industry. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about a parallel world that is not even figured for those who live in a big city like São Paulo. All the actors are improvising and are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confused world, the loneliness of each character and invites us to share their world. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and the worst thing is to rent at home.
