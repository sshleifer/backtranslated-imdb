First I bought this movie on VHS so I had to buy it on dvd, it's one of my all time favorite movies. I read the book, but I really think the movie is so much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam, as Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. It was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
