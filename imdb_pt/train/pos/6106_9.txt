When it comes to the erotic genre, I'm lucky enough to spend the first 20 minutes of the story without getting up or looking for something else to watch. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you do not touch me) directed two very strong actors, Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery, in this captivating thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim," a sweet innocent novelist who is caught in the seduction web of "The Man" by Doug Jeffery, a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions on paper, and as an actress, giving what could have simply been another depth and credibility. I believe it's your best performance yet. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great gift for erotic literature.
