Everyone should see this movie because each of us is broken in some way and this can help us realize 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) How important it is to adopt a child in need. There are so many out there. To think that the film was actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world has and always will be. Corrupt, but corruption does not have to come to your house. We all have a choice! I definitely recommend this ... and while you're at it, I'd like to play "The Purple Color" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
