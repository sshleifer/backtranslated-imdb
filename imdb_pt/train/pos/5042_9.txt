The synopsis of this movie does a great job of explaining what to expect. It's a really good thriller. Well filmed. Hard to believe it was the debut in the direction of Bill Paxton, although some photos seem EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> Still, there are some photos that really look good and show some real imagination on Paxton's part. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with a few twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun and, best of all, obscured enough to turn them into real twists. <br /> <br /> The movie's young actors are also great. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because they often go out as Nickelodeon rejects, but both kids do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bloody. It's not too scary. But it's very, very scary.
