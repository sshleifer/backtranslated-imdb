<br /> <br /> I suppose this is not the best movie ever, but I voted for 10 stars the same way. Mainly because of my feelings in the end. Me and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something you do not always feel. We are all getting a little cynical and fed up with sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The story of the film revolves around Jane, a young girl in the late stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This could have been so easily a boring and dignified piece, but it is so funny, human and lacking in sentimentality that you win completely and against the odds is a good movie. <br /> <br /> The acting of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb, especially the last one that is always believable and strong in its role. The chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards' masterpiece, an airplane made out of garbage and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for Richards and Janes to live life to the fullest, so that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A cute and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. Do not let the subject keep you away.
