This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults, no matter where they are in their relationship. As a married man 26 years ago, I feel empathy for the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows it. I also like his monotonous delivery; never gets too excited or too low. A good set of characters. This will be a good addition to Monday night's schedule. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It is best appreciated in small doses. It also seems a little old to still be trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I liked the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series develops.
