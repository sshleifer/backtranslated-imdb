let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watching the reign over me I was paying close attention to his acting when he raises his voice, I can not help thinking of happy gilmore screaming with a golf ball, so I kick back when Adam Sandler sucks on me <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that starts slowly with you waiting for excitement in every scene <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a great job and is not exception here with some really great lines and is worthy of an Oscar in any movie he does <br/> <br/> Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways, not only was this his most dramatic / best film of his career . but I do remember laughing aloud in many parts of this movie. The supporting cast was great too with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. I highly recommend this movie of yours has tremendous gorgeous action plans from the great NYC comedy drama And a new respect for Adam Sandler if you ever doubted him or a guarantee of how great Don Cheadle is
