This movie seems to suffer negative reviews for some reason. Probably just by population mass. Anyway, this is really a very interesting movie. The film is a below-budget science fiction film that really works due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If there are any science fiction fans reading this, I really recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction. The movie has crazy ideas. The scenario includes nations that are at war with GIGANTIC machines, in which countries invest all the money! The world was divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else to a war, or rather a "robot duel." The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, since now everyone is wearing these breathing masks. Definitely a movie that makes you think. Smart, well written and good effects for the despicable budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have small budgets and really work.
