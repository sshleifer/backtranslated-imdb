A meteor falls from the sky and awakens a plesiosaur who has long terrified the area around Crater Lake. While the monster eats the locals, they try to get rid of killing the monster. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send horror and science fiction movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are debatable when you have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for viewing. It's the kind of movie that these movies fake and send only this is the real deal. It's all these movies try to be just with the tongue on the cheek and it's a lot more fun because of it. This is a true drive-in movie that had the unlucky luck to come at a time when Star Wars has changed the way we look at special effects. The monster, a mixture of stop motion and a life-size head, is a small, charming creature. The filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Of course it's all false, but are not movies about suspension of disbelief? Actually I think it's about really cool monsters, what it has. <br /> <br /> I like this movie on a low budget drive in a way. If you want a real authentic drive in the monster movie, look no further. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with movies of lake-like monsters (Boggy Creek etc.)
