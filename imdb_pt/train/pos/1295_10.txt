The book on which this film is based was excellent; It took a while to deal with the unconventional style of Houellebecq, but once I understood the humor behind the writing, I was completely drawn to the world of sadness of the author. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it elucidated my own personal struggle and made the futility of my own struggle more difficult to accept. Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by Harel and the apathy and indifference of the hero to a world that rejected him is perfectly portrayed. This is a movie that reveals today's society to humble man in all its horror. I hope things change in the future, but at the moment we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie. It is probably better that Harel or Houellebecq not create such a genius again. One is enough for any man.
