The film begins with a group of children in retirement school and focuses on a boy named "Gabe," who apparently worked hard to earn his probation. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon Gabe meets the Dead End Kids. The Kids in this movie are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than in previous films and deep down, they are well-meaning punks. However, in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through criminal fire and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat - after all, he had been reforming the school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed . So when Gabe is about to be sent back to The Big House, it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real thugs. Dead End Kids appeared in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s, and the films were generally very good (especially DIRTY KNIVES). However, after the boys' contracts expired, they went to Monogram Studios and the films, to be charitable, were very weak and stereotyped - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed "The Bowery Boys. " Because Hall and Gorcey were not constantly attacking the camera, it's a very good movie - and it almost earns 7 points (it's REAL next). In fact, while this is not a great movie aesthetically, it's a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Of course, it was a little corny - particularly in the end when kids take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights - but it was also a lot of fun. The Dead End Kids are doing their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan gave excellent support. Of course, that part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still funny and quite charming - so if you can suspend disbelief, it works fine.
