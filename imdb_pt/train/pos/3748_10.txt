I've watched it several times and am planning on buying the full feature. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It is very different and unique and is very pleasant. I love indie movies and this one is great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking spatula called Edward. The order of events is a bit confusing, making this movie very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus shifts to earlier in his life. This is a silly movie, but of course, it's still great. I recommend you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. Humor may not suit everyone's taste, but watch anyway. It will only take 16 minutes of your time and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA WIFE!
