Do we all create our own reality, or do we? This is the central question behind this highly original and masterfully elaborated examination of the illusory nature of reality. Blending Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual language of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?", And turn it into 100 captivating and entertaining minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer who struggles with his screenplay, "The Sea That Thinks." As he sits on his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his session on the computer, writing the script. In a short time he is trapped in a whirling enigma in which everything he writes comes true. Director Gert de Graaff addresses his subject with a malicious sense of humor and enchants the viewer with a series of stunning visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, Graaff's film challenges the public at various levels to question whether anything we see, touch or prove is really what it seems to be, or whether our whole understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick touched by we. our senses.
