An angry boy who tragically lost his parents is taken care of by his grandfather. Together, they find common ground in the Gaelic folktales that were orally transmitted from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as Highland slacks, appear in the stories, there is an astounding amount of humor and joy in them. Everything is filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountainous landscape is breathtaking, and is a rare opportunity to hear the Scottish Gaelic spoken. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of Gaelic spoken is wonderful. The performances are exactly what you'd expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you're watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially in Skye, has worked numerous small miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should go and see this movie.
