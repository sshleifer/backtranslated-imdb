We play around the term "superstar" very little these days, but here's a guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was stuck on the set of this whole show. The selection of songs was perfect - it contained only the songs I really wanted to hear and came up with documentaries during the new, weaker songs. I loved that the band was only five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs from that force, you do not need a circus to have fun). <br /> <br /> The audience photos were amazing, too. How many artists can affect the original Beatles fans (now in their 50s or more), get young people to jump in the opening lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and make an impact on everyone else? <br /> <br /> As I watched, I also realized that in the wake of John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney immediately became a belated reflection. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relationships, it must be difficult to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never seemed to deserve the recognition that the murder of Lennon received. I agree that Lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was half forgotten later. I was very happy that he found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> As for those complaining about the audio / video quality, I had no complaints; both were crystalline in my set. I think these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format is released; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> My only regret was not buying a ticket for this show when I had the chance. Thanks to this video, I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they first remember his murder and after his music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And let's hope another lunatic does not change that, because McCartney's catalog is very good.
