Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie of all time ... But it's better than many of you have said. I have not seen a homo-themed movie better than this. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative films with a clear beginning, development and outcome. But European films are less narrative, but they make you think a lot and feel. <br /> <br /> Many of you have not understood the meaning of the movie. The purpose of this film is not to show a simple "summer". love movie, "with commercial characters who" fall in love and live happily ever after. "Summer and beach vacations are just a backdrop, and this movie is targeted at all the boys who feel identified with these boys. > <br /> Perhaps some of you have not understood this movie well, because of its 3 parts, shown as flashbacks.These 3 moments are: - Summer in Pornichet, when they meet and love - After a year and a half who lives together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go to a psychiatrist, he tries to commit suicide, and Cedric takes him to the hospital, and later he appears talking to a psychiatrist to find out why he did it. Mathieu goes back to Pornichet in the winter, alone ... to think about how his life has changed, how his life will become, and trying to find himself. It is possible that some people could not understand all this well , because all the scenes are mixed between them. s anyway, like I said before ... this is not a funny movie. If what one wants to see is meat, for that we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what he wants to show us, is how cruel life can be, for a boy who is not sure about his feelings and is not sure what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to leave home and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him happiness. But what seemed perfect in the beginning ... later is not as good as he thought, and he was disturbed, and feel that he lost the way of his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. He finally gets depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? It's not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? just a few .. but this is not an entertainment movie. It's all about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with Mathieu's life and problems, and that's what the director wanted to do. a movie that shows us the cruel reality of a boy 's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best homo-themed movie of all time.
