It's hard for me to criticize anything Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace on screen and is a phenomenal actress. Nevertheless, yes, the plot was predictable. I think perhaps, if Jill HAD had slept with Richard, that might have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would increase suspense even more. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a little more history. I was a bit disappointed with the end of the movie. I wish I had seen more closure with Zack's death and possibly closing with her husband. I have to say though, I will never be able to look at a firearm and not imagine it there. It was a very fitting end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi rocked! I'm so looking forward to your future projects.
