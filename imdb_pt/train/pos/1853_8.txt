Well, it is once again a movie that plays with your feelings and you come out all smooth unlike a rocky movie. But I'm a sucker for that, so I gave a good note ... the acting was very good and there was a lot of feeling. Violence is kept to a minimum that makes a change. I would have given a 9 if it was not for the greeting in the end! All in all a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
