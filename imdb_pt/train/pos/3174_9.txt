Very rarely do you come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The script director not only faced the challenge of directing his own work, but also made a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The script takes an interesting look not only at the plight of the troubled writer, but he mixes so much comedy in the writer's bleak world that you can not fail to commit to Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Despite the miniscule budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious appearance. He's not joking when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what it comes next. This guy can make people laugh and think; This is special.
