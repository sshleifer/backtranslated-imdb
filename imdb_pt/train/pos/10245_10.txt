this was one of my favorites when I was young, had all that was great with children's movies of the 90's ... adorable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain and some great songs (not the typical mermaid / beauty and I ran into this movie again recently and I still love it as much as ever! I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie, and I definitely think it should be presented to younger generations! sorry not the most informative, I'm kind of in a hurry ... just please, trust me. everyone who goes against this movie is killing your inner child!
