Another very good Mann film, thanks to the combination father / son of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic consciousness of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the younger man picks up his fork or curve. "You're wrong, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he cares only for himself, but of course he can not leave Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as Skagway's law with due respect for the pitfalls of justice over her reality. Another important topic is to help people and in turn be helped by people. The lonely can do nothing and suffer for it. <br /> <br /> The above caption reproduces Tatum's claim that he can not live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction is fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now I own the DVD.
