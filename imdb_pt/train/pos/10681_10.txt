While the British produced some hilarious and slippery serials in the 1990s - Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc. - the '70s were the real golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s there were entirely new territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and the slowly evolving consciousness of a need for "sensibility" that twenty years later would become correct politics. Attempts to deal with the confusion of this completely modern world were the subtle and not-so-subtle themes in everything from the Monty Python Flying Circus sketches to comedies like Man On the House. (In the late 1970s, this "grappling" resulted in more meditative and bittersweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece Butterflies.) Man About the House is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time - one little gentle, cheeky, fresh, naive, sometimes scandalous, with some well-made remarks about contemporary life. Compare yourself to a cynical 90's show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that the two were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man About the House is one of the great britcoms of the 70's, right up there with Good Neighbors (Good Life) and George and Mildred's House. Its quality is attested by the fact that - as with Good Neighbors - its creators, writers, and many of their cast had continued success on British television.
