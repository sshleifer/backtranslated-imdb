I show this film to college students in speech and media law because their lessons are timeless: Why talk about injustice is important and can bring the changes sought by the downtrodden. Why freedom of the press and freedom of expression are essential for democracy. This is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of Steven Biko and Donald Woods journalism. It also gives an important lesson in freedom of expression: "You can put out a candle, but you can not put out the fire. When the flame starts to pick up, the wind will take you higher." (From Biko by Peter Gabriel to Shaking the Tree).
