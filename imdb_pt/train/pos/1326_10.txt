I saw this movie at a college film festival in the 70's - I've been waiting FOREVER for this movie to come out on video (it finally came out). It was made in Brazil so I assumed that was why I had not gotten to the video yet. I've been checking video stores for the last 15 years waiting for this great movie to come out! It's one of my all time favorites - but remember, it's strange, as Werner Herzog strange - his strangeness stems from his super-realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a true incident back to a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first encountered the tribes in the Amazon. A white man is mistaken for a wild tribe of cannibals as his enemy, so they intend to kill him. Before dispatching them, however, they are part of your tribe (your custom). The whole movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary when he becomes an accepted member of his tribe. That's it. Cosmic plot? No. Intense insight into the variety of human life? Definitely. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... be warned ... this movie has definite nudity - it's not a hollywood movie about noble savages ... this movie tells how it was (re-read) above: National Geographic, super -realism) <br /> <br />
