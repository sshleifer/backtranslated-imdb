Noll's comfortable way of issuing blunt, often expletive, comments to describe things about which he has more knowledge than most, is quite refreshing. There is another character in the movie who constantly tries to verbalize complicated problems, using more language than necessary. This guy should never have received a Thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know you're ready for a treat! <br /> <br /> The way the pioneers of big-wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a "lost era." No matter the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less take care of issues like medical care. The use of old movie clips was done with mastery.
