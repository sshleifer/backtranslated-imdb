NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old building where she meets some bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations. As attorney Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) asks questions on her behalf, she strives to maintain her sanity (not to mention her willingness to live), as her experiences undermine her physical, mental, and emotional health. I do not want to ruin the best moments of this psychological horror film for those who are not familiar with it. The story is interesting and fun, but the film does not offer much in real terms of scares. Or, by the way, any atmosphere. It's kind of sinisterly sinister, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It's more a story about a woman's attempts to deal with the growing unreality in her life. At that level, it works, but it's not very powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What The Sentinel offers are some flashy pieces (in particular, the fascinating, fabulously scary climax, and there's a scene with Beverly D'Angelo that must be seen to be credited). There is also some blood to be seen, but not much. A sinister Gil Melle soundtrack adds to the threat. <br /> <br /> No review of this movie would be complete without an evaluation for the filmmakers in bringing together excellent actors for their cast. Some of them can not do much, but seeing them all together is amazing. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest hits as, respectively, an intransigent detective and a solicitous neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum make brief appearances, and other well-known faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Whoever the casting director for this movie deserves some kind of prize. Written for the screen by director Michael Winner, probably best known for the series "Death Wish" he did with Charles Bronson, of the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a really great horror thriller, but it has its moments and it's reasonably fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
