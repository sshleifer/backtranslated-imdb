As the title is in English and IMDb lists the program's primary language as English, I will focus on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as presented on the Bandai DVD. My real review for the entire series is under the entry of the IMDb "" Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W "(1995). <br /> <br /> Very little is changed in relation to the plot, script and characterization of his adaptation to English and it really depends on your own taste in choosing which language to watch this show. Purists can stay with the Japanese as much as they want, but for a more "realistic" experience I recommend the song in English as all the characters except Heero Yuy are not Japanese. (Most of them are Caucasian, in fact, with a couple of non-Japanese Asians.) On the one hand, the characters' personalities come across more "directly" than in the Japanese version. is stronger thanks to some give. Or a very well-formed group of actors. Wing Gundam pilot Heero Yuy is a highly trained soldier who represses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. resentment can be criticized as "bad acting", but it fits in well with Heero's personality. Duo Maxwell of Deathscythe Gundam, always cheerful in the face of death, receives an intensive course of valuing life and friends. He is possibly the most well represented character in the entire show, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. He may sound a bit too old for his age, but Duo's English voice easily appears in his nastily nasal Japanese. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the Heavyarms pilot, is a lonely, lost soul that has only one purpose until now. combat; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not make friends. Kirby Morrow gives a dark but realistic performance as Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Burr The winner is voiced by Brad Swaile, who has no problem distinguishing the character's affectionate nature and breaking his innocence when he experiences horrors. of war and death at first hand. A big plus point is that Quatre does not sound like a girl anymore (and yes, he is voiced by an actress in the Japanese version), but a typical 15-year-old guy. The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang, dubbed by Ted Cole, may seem a bit exaggerated, but it stands in sharp contrast to the more submissive roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, dubbed by Lisa. Ann Bailey. This may not fit well with your juvenile incarnation at the beginning of the series, but as your character matures later in the story, your voice follows suit and ends up fitting nicely with the character's development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise be one of the most drastically altered voices when compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect, keeping in line with his high status status and charismatic nature. His English voice by Brian Drummond is more restrained, sounding more dishonest and "snare-like," highlighting Zechs' secret nature in relation to his hidden agendas and firm beliefs in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are really mixed bag. Treize Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his Japanese style of speaking larger than life. However, Lady Une does not convey her split personality in a contrasting way as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin sounds ......... bored most of the time. Gunners and military leaders are also nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I would have appreciated if they had taken the time to give the different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic origins. The voices of Maganac Corp were generally uninspired, but could have been more interesting if they had received Middle Eastern accents. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have sounded better with some elegant European accent that reflected their nobility status. <br /> <br /> Despite the uninteresting acting of the supporting characters, the main cast manages to lead the show and this results in a less exaggerated and more realistic general interpretation of the Gundam Wing script. Very faithful to the original Japanese script, keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also maintains the flaws of the original Japanese script.
