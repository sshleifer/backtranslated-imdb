Dinner could be, in my opinion, the greatest adult movie production of all time. It is produced in such an exquisite way and the actors portray their roles in an excellent way. The kitchen scene, starring Yvonne and Juli Ashton, is magnificent. The use of butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the scene of the doctor's office is well done. The campfire scene is full of enjoyable action, although the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible, but who would expect less from it? The final scene is a little used in adult movies, but it's a classic, though. I recommend this movie to all adult movie fans and those casual viewers. Run to your rental store and get it today.
