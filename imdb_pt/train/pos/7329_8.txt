I really liked this movie. The humor was a little absent at times, but I liked how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is the only second film I saw Verdone acting on (the other was 'Un sacco bello'), and I can see why the Italians find him tiring, but he thinks he played well as a loving father. <br /> <br /> The only downside to this movie was that I knew it was happening in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I presume, but I felt that there was no representation of a place. This movie could have happened in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it important that the films have a place to give viewers something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you'll enjoy it. It's not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. It's a comic story with serious moments that can really happen to any of us.
