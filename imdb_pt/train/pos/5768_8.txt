A collapse in a nuclear power plant causes most people to turn into lethal, snarling, lethal zombies who naturally experience violent attacks. A handful of uninfected people do their best to survive this harsh experience. Director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets exhibits an incredibly candid love and passion for animated and creepy horror films: he keeps a thought-provoking rhythm everywhere, fills the screen with wall-to-wall freaks. action, and fortunately keeps the dialogue awful to a pleasant minimum. In addition, the Sheets certainly do not skimp on exaggeratedly glorious and exaggerated splatter: this image offers a tasty truck of melted meat, evisceration, a lot of chewing of intestines, a guy has his heart plucked, and there is even a good impalement on a branch of tree. Sheets earns bonus points by keeping the dark and unpleasant tone to the bitter end literal (for example, almost all major characters end up becoming zombies). Granted, this movie has its fair share of flaws: the ragamuffin issue, several unsuccessful duck attempts, and the gruesome acting of a nameless cast all leave much to be desired. The top honors go to the beautiful and lively Kasey Rausch for his victorious portrayal of the ingenious Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay also performed well as Army veteran Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets' understanding of a contagious sense of ruthless impulse and obvious affinity with the horror genre ensures that it remains a complete blast to watch from beginning to end.
