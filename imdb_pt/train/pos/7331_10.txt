In a time of magic, barbarians and demons abound a devilish tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the ice kingdom and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra was kidnapped by Nekhron's henchmen, a warrior named Larn must protect her and must defeat Nekhron to rule the world and kingdom with the help of an avenger called Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> A well-underrated and excellent animated epic that combines live actors with animation drawn on them (rotoscopia), is Ralph Bakshi's second best film, with "American Pop" being number one and "Heavy Traffic" being the third and "Wizards" the fourth. It is certainly better than your "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the work of art is designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has good coloring and there is also a hot for the guys. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for lovers of fantasy and animation everywhere, especially the new DVD 2-Disc Limited Edition of Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Black Cauldron", "The Black Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian", "The Wizard of Oz", "Rock & Rule", "Wizards" "" Starchaser: Legend of Orin "," Fantastic Planet "," Princess Mononoke "," Nausicca: Wind Valley "," Conan The Destroyer "," Willow "," The Promised Princess " 1978), "The Sword in the Stone", "Excalibur", "Dark Army", "Krull", "Dragonheart", "King Arthur", "The Hobbit" , "Conquest", "American Pop", "Jason and the Argonauts", "Clash of the Titans", "The Last Unicorn", "The Secret of NIMH" "" Legend, "" The Chronicles of Narnia, "" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
