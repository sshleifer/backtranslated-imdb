This movie is incredible. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde after growing up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this movie, a young Sho (Gackt) comes across a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live from others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but not foolish. The plot was very original, and unlike your typical vampire movie. The plot was thick with twists and very fascinating. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I would say the film had, despite the lack of a happy ending - though peaceful - would be multi-lingual. I had the unedited version (I'm lucky to have understood all of it except some of the Cantonese) so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> After all, the film was simply fantastic.
