I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in the US in 1984. I've seen it many, many times since. What strikes me in the film is the incorporation of the art of the essay into the lives of the characters and vice versa. Throughout the film, the two are intertwined and sometimes one never knows for sure whether someone is watching the characters' lives or a rehearsal scene. This continues until the climax of the film. All those years later, my friends and I still like to debate whether "Carmen" is actually stabbed or not in the end. From the reactions of the other characters to stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art and the brilliance of the performances combine to create a superb film that, once again, blends and distorts the line between life and art.
