I had no expectations; I've never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the movie has some strong actors. I thought it was a lot of fun; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is fantastic (true, this is not your best role). I thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well made. I did not expect much and I was happy surprise.
