Karen goes to a Japanese house as Emma's substitute nurse, a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen climbs up after hearing noises when she encounters a scary ghost. She will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's too scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. The settings are scary. I love the whole plot! The ending was shocking! I paused in a scene where the little boy cried so loudly that the man found his sister upstairs and was shocked. This is the scariest movie I've ever seen. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
