... and I love it. Many special effects, and for a movie that is not made in mega budget, this movie really does a great job when creating a fantasy work. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story, but this was still a great movie to watch. It's definitely up there in standards overcoming Bored of the Rings, and on par with films like Harry Potter. Which is saying a lot to a movie again, made in a fraction of the budget of these international successes. <br /> <br /> One thing I really love about this movie is that it stretches the envelope of the upcoming adventure movie so much. out of Hong Kong. The theme is exotic and original. Production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of HK for fantasy action film, and acting is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to come out of Hong Kong, this is Hong Kong's Infernal Affairs fantasy film. And I hope they continue to work in this area until they get over the Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Simply fantastic.
