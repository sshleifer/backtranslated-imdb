The British horror film was in terminal decline in the early seventies, but out of the darkness came three films that were among the best produced by our island. Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House That Dripped Blood made the future look rosy, even though many people knew by now that there would not be one. The THTDB has the cast type that could easily form a wish list, if it had not been really set up, in the gloomy interior of 2008, you might be waiting to wake up. Waxworks is the most neglected of the four stories and is, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are so tightly intertwined that you can not tell where performance ends and pain begins. One can only imagine how this role affected such a gentle and sensitive man. Death and the Lady. RIP Peter.
