Three British Army sergeants stationed in India are sent to prevent a revolt of a tribe of assassins known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leaves the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees led by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, regent regent, returns to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but they are also captured. Now the major sends a complete detail after the three, but does not realize that they are entering a trap set by the Thugees. It is, however, Gunga Din who saves the day. Excellently made friend film, although it is politically incorrect today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very good-humored and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10.
