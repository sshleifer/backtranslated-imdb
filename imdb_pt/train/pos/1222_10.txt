I peeked these shorts on a DVD of New Zealand's best shorts, all great, but the French Doors was amazing. It starts slowly and you wonder if something is going to happen. Just as you relax in the drum of domestic renovation, the most amazing thing happens. <br /> <br /> EEEekkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> Movies plunge into the primal fear of the dark and with little, if any, special effects. It made you shiver straight to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept opened up all the memories of when I was young and dreamed of the most unlikely but frightening situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of the filmmakers is fantastic and the main character takes you convincingly throughout history. It's a short quality I have not seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The French Doors have all the features of a great feature, but it ends after ten minutes. Never less a grand finale that begs you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> I loved and did well and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders are really turning talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
