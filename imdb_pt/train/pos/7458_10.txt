This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and must be in the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but Nightfire showed up and it was better, but now there's a new kind of James Bond game. This time it is a third person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the game graphics are out of this house. He still has all the great actors and actresses in this game as Pierce Bronsan as James Bond once again, William Dafoe as villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me if I spell it wrong). This game would be the biggest James Bond game out there. <br /> <br /> I give this a 10/10
