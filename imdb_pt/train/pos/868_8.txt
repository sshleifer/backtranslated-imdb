What is very French about this movie is the time taken to establish the two main characters. This may require a little patience, especially since neither is "appealing" in the typical Hollywood definition. However, once the "assault" comes on the scene, the film moves forward quickly, perhaps sometimes very fast. But it's a true roller coaster ride and if you do not look very closely, it's all very believable. The kind of movie you know Hollywood would have failed.
