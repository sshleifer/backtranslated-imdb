A great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, somber and horrifying, perfectly SURREAL (looks like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it with David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style perhaps mixed with a bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) ... <br /> <br /> Add a bit of Night on Earth, Angel Heart and a little Begin, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder , Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - which should together form at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you're out of the vanguard and / or surrealist cinema (as I am) you'll like this. If you're expecting something more like an action-packed movie with some medium storyline - try your luck with something else. Final words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual and this is probably the # 1 reason why most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
