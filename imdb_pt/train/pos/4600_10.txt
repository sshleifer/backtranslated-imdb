This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. This is still the best action movie ever made. Today's action movies are badly made Action actors and directors do not know how to make it fight and do acrobatics. only a few do not like to do it mainly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The acrobatics are so smart and wild that I do not think we'll ever see the likes. The start where Chan and his team descend the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. The maneuvers of end of fight are for me the best stunts of fight already posted in the cinema. The final blow sliding across the pole through Jackie's glass was badly wounded.
