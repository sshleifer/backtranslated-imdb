You can not enjoy this jewel, the Invisible Ray of 1936, many times. But you can not forget that. The story is elegant. Karloff, austere and embittered in his refuge in the Carpathian mountains, is Janos Rukh, a science genius who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological past - particularly the fall of a powerful radioactive meteor in Africa. Joining him is the always elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry". Frances Drake is the adorable and underused young wife; Frank Lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still beautiful. It also contains some wonderful lines. A Rukh restores his mother's vision, he asks, "Mother, can you see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever. And what I see scares me." Even better when Mother Rukh says, "He broke the first law of science." I am not alone among my acquaintances in having intrigued for many many years exactly what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely desert island stuff.
