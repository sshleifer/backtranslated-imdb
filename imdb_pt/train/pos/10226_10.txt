I was about 7 years old when I saw this movie first. It was not so special then, but a few years later, I saw it again and this time it was fun, a lot :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language and the special effects too. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a blockbuster made in Hollywood, even this movie was made of approx. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it.films and video version too (But I do not think this has been shown in theaters) <br /> <br /> Watch enjoy !!! Yeti forever !!!
