This collection of eleven short stories in a movie is a great idea, and features some big segments, but also some disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to address the American tragedy. The result of most of them is not just an individual sympathy for the American people, but mainly for intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (UK) presents the best segment, on September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with US support. The other excellent segments are that of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by US governments in different countries throughout contemporary history; and Mira Nair (India), showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States when he was indeed a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children preparing a harmless bomb shelter while her teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world; the romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows the effects of his war in a small place and the solitary protest of the widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; and the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most striking, showing that there is no holy war but sadness and doom. <br /> <br /> The segment of Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very naive, but portrays the poor conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> The Amos Gital (Israel) segment is very annoying and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, horrible, uninspired and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "September 11" ("September 11")
