I loved this movie. I knew I would be shocked by camp and nonsense like the original series. I found it very exciting to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar together again. Who loved the Batman series of the 60's should have liked Return to the Batcave. You could say that the actors had a lot of fun making this movie, especially Adam West. And I bet he would have jumped back into his Batman costume if the script required him to do it. I told several friends about this movie that they chose not to see ... now they wish they had. I have all 120 original episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thanks for meeting Adam and Burt.
