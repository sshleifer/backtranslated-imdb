"The Great Farewell" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard posing as private investigator Dixon Hill. These episodes create some sort of standard pattern, repeated several times in TNG, as well as DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances besides playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand the possibility of Star Trek and allow a kind of mix of genres. Picard's stories on Dixon Hill are examples of 1940s detective fiction and his on-screen depiction is known as Film Noir, generally having the anti-hero stereotype in the lead (see, for example, Chandler Marlowe's stories or Polanski's classic " Chinatown "). Star Trek never focuses on history (most often it's a simple "how-to-do" scenario), but it allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. These "games" of the Holodeck are commonly used for recreation and reflect the particular interests of the crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected, and from this point of view, the stories are never solid (but Star Trek has always had a technical and scientific point, I mean, in addition to some utopian concepts?). "Great-bye" shows a laid-back Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who almost never looked better on a Star Trek episode (at least the first ones) and Data also has great scenes (though I find it hard to believe that pull the lamp The wall plug would have really surprised him, because he did research on this period and its customs). Wesley continues to turn the peaceful Trekkies into potential killers (why did not they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters do him?), But it's all fun ...
