There are many types of meeting shows. One type is where ancient actors are taken out of mothballs and bred to recreate characters they have not played in twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. `Return to Mayberry ', despite some nonsense, was fine; `Return to Green Acres' as execrable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script that I will not repeat here, but both the movie and the stink movie); "Gilligan's Island Rescue" filled a necessary gap in the history of the shipwrecked, though the show itself was silly even from the "Gilligan Island" point of view. In most cases, scripts are weak; sometimes a nonsense appears in the scripts that is too much knowing? and comedy is almost always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny. New characters are introduced and do not fit into the mix. For the most part, these reunion shows are pretty weak. A second type of 'reunion' show is the kind in which the cast leaves its past aside, but sits down, telling stories, reminiscing, interspersed with flashbacks of the shows. Then there are movies based on the shows, which are rarely good; and films based on the show's history ("The Brady Bunch" had both happening, with multiple hits). <br /> <br /> "Return to the Batcave" uses almost all of the above, with a wonderfully distorted viewpoint, which makes it the best of the reunion shows, and has raised the level of others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward are summoned for a display of the original Batmobile. While they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> Adam West of the movie is a demented man. He called Jerry, his butler, "Alfredo." He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to go down to the garage. He is obsessed with being a crime fighter, when in fact he is just a washed-up actor. When the Batmobile is stolen, he not only believes it is his duty, as a crime fighter, to retrieve it, as Burt Ward drags, as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The chase is largely loquacious, with West and Ward reminiscent. about the old days. He is broken by "flashbacks" with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. Modern scenes and flashbacks have the strange lack of reality that the show maintained. There are also jokes that show that West is able to make fun of himself: in Ward's book about his time on the show, he spoke frankly about West's libido and also about being a skinflint (West makes Ward pay for everything in his pursuit , below tips and bus passages). The clues they follow, the characters they encounter (even in flashback) fit the mentality of the old series, and there are several honors, including a fight with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is extremely funny and made with great panache. There are also cameos by Julie Newmar (looking like she had a facelift too) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why he has such educated followers. Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, has been long forgotten. The film turns into a rather obvious but funny climax. <br /> <br /> Is this show a model for reunion shows? unfortunately, there are few that can fit the pattern. This show had actors repeating their old characters; young actors playing a film about the production of the show; the actors West and Ward reminiscing; and a modern movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West. It has everything. If you loved the old show, this is the cork in the bottle.
