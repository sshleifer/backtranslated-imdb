Worth watching, especially with the good turnaround of a journalist with integrity, you're expecting a great storyline fall as Gray Owl is unmasked as a scam but is not to be and contributes to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and the movie. <br /> <br /> This has to be Brosnan's best performance to date, he convinces admirably as the English boy who plays Indians. The highlight scene is the return to your aunts? where Brosnan and the two older actresses make a wonderful scene, filled with a sense of nostalgia and a lost life with so little dialogue, just with expressions and good direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known and the message so universal and important, it's a shame that this film has not been recognized, maybe in time it can become a classic and a sleeper. Hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
