I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful at it. Play the role of the modern mage to the fullest. (And it's absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped inspire an RPG that I really like, Mage: The Awakening. I've shown this at several LARP after-parties, and it's always a big hit. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and very enjoyable. The plot is fast and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are very good for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and tacky in all the right places. A good way to spend a night.
