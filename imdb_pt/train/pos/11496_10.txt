I love this movie too. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany at a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was very crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The erotic of the film hit the viewers and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, the producer and director, has always been underlined by this. In its genre, it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of this movie, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or more. three more short films worked for the TV too before he became a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For people who want to see the movie again, you can find it on your homepage, which is not so easy to look for but it is possible.
