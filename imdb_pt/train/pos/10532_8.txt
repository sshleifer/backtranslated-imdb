Neither of them was guilty, but in the face of the accusations and their house about to be demolished, they eventually entered, well, nothing. The whole world, except for his house, has gone. <br /> <br /> It's kind of weird but funny too. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But it gets old fast, it seems. <br /> <br /> So they start to improve their life by hating memories.
