I took my 10 year old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found myself completely entertained. First off, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. Most children's movies today are full of crude humor and coarse jokes to provoke cheap laughs from the preteen teen crowd. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, however, and the humor is subtle and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The title role is played with a refreshing vivacity by Emma Roberts, who is cheerful and polite without ever becoming annoying. Unlike the Brady Bunch Movie, in which the anachronistic characters are ridiculed and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great time when Los Angeles-style girls in Parisian Paris Hilton costumes are dispensed with by the boutique owner, while Nancy, in her penny shoes and Butterick's homegrown dress, is hugged. This film avoids the need to illuminate this approach that many Hollywood movies do. Nancy remains true to herself and her values. <br /> <br /> The mystery is just tense enough to be attractive. There were several moments of suspense when my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no free shock scenes. Everything is based on tension and humor and it's a lot of fun. The supporting cast is good, particularly Marshall Bell as the scary guard. There are great entries from Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a better audience than some of them. Not only was I happy not to be dragged into another computer animated film, where talking animals belched and left gasoline all over the place, but I was also very entertained. If I were there without a child, I still would have liked the movie. This is a DVD that will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
