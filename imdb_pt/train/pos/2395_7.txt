Although I had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. A look from the inside to the staging of "The Scottish Play" as the actors call it "Macbeth" to produce it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and elegant treatment of the betrayal that falls on the troupe. With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding much better than your small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world class, but totally satisfying.
