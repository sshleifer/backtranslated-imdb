I voted excellent for how well the show went, not the content. It still gives me goosebumps after reading the book, after watching the movie. Two ex-offenders are traveling to their destination to steal a family of money from one of the cons learned during the arrest. During the ride, the tension begins to increase, as the soundtrack of the film increases the overall expectation. After the killers finish work on the farm, the next morning the remains of the family are found by the friend of the daughter's church. The cry of freezing blood as the scene touched the phone with the cut wire really made my blood freeze and chills me. That the murderers have found their just destinies is a small comfort to this condemned family. Robert Blake excelled in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.
