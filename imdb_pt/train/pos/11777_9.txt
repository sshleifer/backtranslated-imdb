"Jared Diamond made it a point in the first episode that the other peoples of the world did not have animals to tame, but the Europeans did, and that explains why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines." It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. Please do not ruin this great play for its simple mentality. The reasons are much more complex than the one thing you mentioned. Please read the book as it is a great source of information. I had so much fun. This book is even taught as a textbook in some universities.
