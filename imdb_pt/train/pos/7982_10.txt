I'm amazed that movies like this can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I have ever seen. I never imagined that a 146 minute movie could make me think about it without stopping. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a former anti-terrorist agent who was taken to the bottle. Once he is assigned to protect the young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redeeming bow is driven in the way that only a lovely little girl can provide. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by thugs, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take the catalyst out of her plush bear. Yes, he became ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie.
