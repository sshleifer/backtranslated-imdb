LET'S GO!!! They did it on purpose !! Two of my favorites on TV (Meloni from "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel from "West Wing") team up for a good sleeper / character study. Plot nothing is extravagant, but the performance is right on the mark. Tim Busfield appears for some pure bits. Worth a look.
