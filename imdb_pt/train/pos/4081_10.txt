I've seen almost every Miyazaki movie, and they're all gorgeous and captivating. But this rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet and affectionate friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also great and the music captures the movie's feelings perfectly. But the characters are the bright spot in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now, let me clarify: I'm actually talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with the English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original version of the language. Voices are better, dialogue, everything. So I suggest watching (and listening) the movie the way it was originally.
