I had put it on my TIVO for a rainy day due to the cast, some really hardworking people in the industry, and when I finally saw I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie tastes like Altman. (it is mentioned in the final credits as a "thank-you"), using seemingly independent and unrelated plots that intertwine when the movie reaches its climax. Macy is pure, clean and honest as a man who seems unable to escape his "destiny", Sutherland touches and portrays how few can, Snow adds splashes to a deliberately understated environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember the Mission Impossible on TV?), Not to mention the constant John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is organized, the dialogue is clich√©-free and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend belief and enjoy, this is truly time well spent.
