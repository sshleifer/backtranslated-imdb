This movie has great acting, great photography and a very strong plot that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit, whether you agree to play a part or get free ... There are already excellent comments on these aspects. I want to comment on the formal configuration of the movie. Basically, there are two people on the roof. There is unity of place and time, with two protagonists, and the radio acting as a choir. Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into films, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, got as admirably as Ettore Scola in addressing the purity and strength of the great Greek tragedies both on the story line and formal configuration. A masterpiece.
