Jeopardy has the feel of being a kind of action film - one of the movies that the studios have thrown between big budgets and box office. It's only 70 minutes and it does not have many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a tough woman once again when she comes across a convicted fugitive while seeking help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. Most of the film is focused on how she handles her kidnapper, who wants her to introduce herself to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological struggling there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little film - its short length makes it tense, and that Stanwyck is great should go unmentioned (but I'll still praise it every time).
