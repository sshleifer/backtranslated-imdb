In short, this is a rather silly whodunnit masked as a drama / biographical film. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda was really like at his peak. I was not disappointed - it produces a truly warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, I can honestly say that I was never really bored at any stage during the film, so a strong *** / 2 out of *****
