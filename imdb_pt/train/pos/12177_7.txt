Recap: On the morning after his bachelor party, Paul is awakened by his mother-in-law and discovers that there is a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately it is a bar waitress, not her bride. And suddenly she pops up everywhere ... at the toll road and at the dinner of her in-laws. And it's hard to keep a secret when your jealous ex-boyfriend followed and photographed him. It's not just about saving your marriage ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: In fact, much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something much funnier, something to a small advantage. This movie was not afraid to take the jokes a little further. And Jason Lee does now how to deliver comedy, especially when his character is half terrified and deeply troubled, as he is here. And he got the support of the beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And in fact I found that Lochlyn Munro played a cool role as the ex. <br /> <br /> So, more emphasis on comedy than on romance, and the end result was good. I love it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
