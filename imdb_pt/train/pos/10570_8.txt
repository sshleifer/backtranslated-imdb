It's hard to say what comes over, the charm and energy of James Cagney or the three excesses of Busby Berkeley in the end. I do a tie, with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest of the early years of musicals. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds immensely to the humorous story. <br /> <br /> And what's the plot? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney), who produces musicals, and who is now almost out of business when talkies take over. He starts doing prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. He has the idea of ​​making bigger and more of them, moving them around the country. He is a fireball and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to continue relentlessly producing these things. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise secretary, loves him, but he is also very busy; a black-rimmed round (Ruby Keeler) office worker wants a chance to dance; his wife appears saying that she did not divorce him at all; a blonde panzer is putting her hooks in it; your partners are betraying him ... my God, what comes next? This all may sound like a lot to digest, but it all happens fast, with Cagney jumping, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the great number passed, when he comes out all singing and dancing - doing a step or two just to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's do a show, gang" we have "We need to build three shows in three days, then close the doors and let's start rehearsing." These three super prologues will feature 40 choirs, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty units of Kent in luxury movie houses ... the whole circuit of the Apollo movie house! Exhaust threatens, feet hurt, but all the uncounted choros in tight suits (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, you can quickly identify Sothern, but Lamour is more generic) stay on the course, dancing their hearts, laughing and chattering. <br /> <br /> And then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate theaters one after another on the same night, with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether it will save Chester's Pele or not. <br /> <br /> The first is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a production number of 9 minutes that presents a lot of healthy lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some may even be married), bedrooms and beds and Do Not Disturb signals. <br /> <br /> Then to the next theater and 11 minutes of "By a Waterfall," which probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worry about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive - dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with slides, a giant pool - you would never think there was a depression. Berkeley takes away all his tricks - timing, human standards, legs and arms making every kind of precision - and he does it in the water, with lots of submerged photography looking up. The girls are sure to play. They come smiling with water in their eyes and still reach their marks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has some quick shots on the water, is the only one who seems a bit cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, the grand finale ... 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to "Shanghai Lil", with all kinds of bar girls and their unusual customers where the races are mixed. There's Cagney and Keeler dancing at the bar, dancing at a table, Cagney struggling. There are what appear to be fifty or sixty mariners on the march, pounding from one side to the other, rifles thrown and caught. So ... this is true ... a human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever featured Roosevelt, a major federal agency and a bunch of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> This is entertainment, people. It's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's Prologs get the big deal and Nan stays with Chester. The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is as kind as she sincerely steps off her taps with flying arms you want to help her along. Joan Blondell makes us forget about many Hollywood women who might have been prettier but who had far less intelligence and personality. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who grabs and shakes, and Berkeley, a man for whom it was never too much.
