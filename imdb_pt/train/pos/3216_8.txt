Todd and his classmates, Sergeant Todd (an excellent and credible performance by the ever-reliable Kurt Russell) is played on a desolate remote planet after being considered obsolete by the cruel and arrogant Colonel Mekum (deliciously played by Jason Isaacs) soldiers were replaced by an advanced new generation of genetically modified fighters. Todd joins a peaceful community of self-sufficient pariahs and has to defend this community when new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a clever and provocative screenplay by David Webb Peoples, portrays a frightening sight of a bleak, cold, and hard near future, maintaining a fast pace and a harsh and harsh tone throughout. In addition, Anderson handles moments of humanity on the move (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously suppressed feelings is genuinely moving) and stages action scenes with excitement. Russell gives a strong and impressive portrait of Todd's almost pantomime; He conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does most of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supports Jason Scott Lee's turn as brutal soldier rival Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the gentle Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as the dumb boy Nathan, Gary Busey as veteran experienced Captain Church, Michael Chiklis like the upbeat Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins. Better yet, this film makes a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical power. David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's full orchestral score and first rate special effects further enhance the quality of the excellent quality of this science fiction / action-fiction hybrid film.
