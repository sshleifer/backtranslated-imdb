When it aired in 1984, my wife and I recorded on our first VHS recorder. I still have this aging tape, which I try to watch annually. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back good memories of happy times - many hours were spent with this movie playing in the background. I finally finished this year and ordered a DVD, which led me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens is captured in an extraordinary way here. George C. Scott is absolutely incredible and totally believable as Scrooge. The supporting cast is equally spectacular. This is, in my view, a flawless production. Small details add a lot to the pleasure. The game "Similes" nephew and wife of Scrooge play with their party guests is a neat item. (I've already recreated this with my high school English learners as a brief break from class work!) Honestly, I can think of a few ways to entertain myself on vacation that I like more than turning myself in to CBS production, which was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original IBM commercials ... that show how much computers have evolved in 21. Incredibly how things have changed!) In short: A Christmas Carol is a timeless story, and this The surrender is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, each one!
