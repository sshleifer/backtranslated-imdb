To those who say that this movie deserves anything beneath the indecent grace it showed, I disagree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I ask you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage it took to film this movie is more remarkable. We think the two brothers are separated when that moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing the safety of themselves and each other. To judge whether it is more noble to record a video of this tragedy or save lives, like those incredible, incredible firefighters are not mine to answer. I only know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I send a sincere 10. That's why the art of filming was created! Capture the natural excitement that real life offers. You can keep your kung-fu junk. Romance is cute. Action will never reach that level. This film, September 11, will be timeless in that it does not glorify itself. She did not have a peek. It did not have all the ostentatious vanities that most of the many films on the many canvases played. It had class, composure, substance, and had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. He spoke of inescapable things to the camera eye. Please consider this film, as it proclaims itself, a moving tribute to all those who have fallen because of the beautiful and free name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give less than a movie that shows, does not embellish, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times. I love "The Godfather," but "9/11" is forever a different kind of movie because it's a different kind of world now. It is art without questioning or questioning. <br /> <br />
