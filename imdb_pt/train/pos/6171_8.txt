For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this movie will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation is. Except for a small subframe, the debut of Sturla Gunnarson is a nearly deadly re-creation of the book (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie can be a bit complicated. Certainly not a great story of cinematic drama. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but it would not have it any other way. The best way to describe such a Long Journey for movie fans would be to say that it is a small-scale Hindi version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble was a banker in the 1970s in Bombay, during the Muslim-Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his eldest individualistic son, a distant friend who surrounds him with some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The ending is not happy, nor is it sad, but it is essentially what realism involves. <br /> <br /> Such a Long Journey is a great movie, but if you want to see, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it received very little release.
