"The Groove Tube" was initially shown on video in the first "video theaters" here in Boston. In one room, there were TV monitors on high shelves, with old movie seats, in small groups facing the monitors. There were old fridges stocked with Pepsi and York Peppermint Patties baskets. In a second smaller room, there were no seats, just large pillows. This was the 'smoking' room, that is, the people stayed there. This act only increased the joy of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a 'frequent viewer'; the scenes that I liked the most and I remember to this day are: Koko The Clown, Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase with naked running through the forest, Finger Ballet in the one that ended being revealed as being the naked body of a woman. The last item was very reminiscent of the late and incredible Ernie Kovacs. Now, I've lost a lot of readers under 48 ("who's Ernie Kovacs ??"), but trust me, it's funny. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I was a "frequent viewer" was that me and my friends would bring other virgins from the "Groove Tube" to see him. We sat and watched maliciously the faces of the "virgins" as PSA "Security Sam" would play. When the camera slowly approaches "Sam", we wait for "OH!" of recognition on the face of the "virgin." Each time was more hilarious than the previous one. And then that 'virgin' would then bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we did. To get this joke, you must watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some are dated, but most plays, movies, and television are now videos. Just look at any video made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Groove Tube" in a theater as a movie, a grainy transfer of the original video. It had been cut and was missing some of the original high point scenes. The first "Saturday Night Live" show, featuring Chevy Chase, sparked immediate remarks of "who's the guy on" The Groove Tube ", so it was a precursor to Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can not look at a can to shorten without hearing the narration, "cover your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy-Lubrication shortening ..." and thinking about the recipe of "Kramp Holiday Loaf" . You always leave me laughing in the Grocery Needs hall. <br /> <br /> The early 1970s were hard times; "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really "caught" the mood of the times. It offered a "hip generation," humor that was not available in any other format. MJH
