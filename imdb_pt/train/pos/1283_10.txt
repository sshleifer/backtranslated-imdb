The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his artistic project is to unmask the ridiculous culture in which we are bathed. Of course, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks comedians (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood hit movies, and plays in many other media. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set in motion. The film is five years old and sounds truer every day. It's the best description of the post-punk rage I've ever seen. It's also one of my 10 favorite movies.
