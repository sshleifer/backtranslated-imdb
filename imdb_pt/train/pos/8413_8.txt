A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. A wizard of evil approaches him and informs him that he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants inside his room. The idiot agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror - and bad things naturally occur as a result. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been made just a decade later, I'm sure it would be so charitable to review and mark this movie. After all, the plot of the film is somewhat vague on some points and the acting is sometimes a bit forced. However, when you consider that in 1913 "full" movies were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! Also, the whole idea of ​​a complex story like the one you see in this movie is very unusual - since the stories were very short and widely interpreted. So, given the limitations of time, this movie is very good and is one of the first known horror movies.
