I saw this movie recently. Two hours later my head still ached with laughter. The plot was so horrible, the jokes were really bad, but what I did not count was: 1. The 2 scenes before and after the movie that Pat and Jay put in (which caused more laughter than sufficient). 2. The kick through the windshield that beheaded the evildoer. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy came with an announcer saying that if you did not like the movie, send a certificate to HBO. While I was considering it, the date you had to send it was in January 1991 (which also caused strangeness).
