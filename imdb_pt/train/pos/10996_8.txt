Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not get very happy. This woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. This is a difficult combination to find nowadays. And Jeremy Northam. I've heard his name many times, but I've never noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is: "use it more". <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I watched one of my shifts in the graveyard. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's a bit complicated and mysterious for that. I still can not believe I did not see the ending coming. I'm not going to tell you why it's going to ruin the movie hole. although to say this is to ruin enough. <br /> <br /> Now I suppose I vote on this movie. I love the dark mystical story, the actors have done a good job and I love the work of directors (natali) in the past. There is not a large audience for this sort of thing, which is also quite risky. you know what, I'm just going to give this one a 8 job because everyone should see this. Then again, the deduction of 1 point always makes room for improvement.
