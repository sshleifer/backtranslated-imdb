This thrilling drama has it all: high-level acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films occur in historical Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is the best of the two films. Jessica Lange did an incredible performance (she should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is terrific in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil and despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another nasty character. I'm always amazed by the incredible variety of characters John Hurt can play. This is a story of a money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-sufficient man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's basically what this story is about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is a lot of fun, it should appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
