This is just the best movie ever! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw this in the early 70's, so it appeared on Bulgarian TV, and I loved it immediately (I was 14 years old). 25 years later I bought it on a video tape, and a few months ago finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I've lived with this movie for 35 years and all my friends and my family, too. My son was a teenager when he first saw him, and he loved immediately too (and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only Hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding Russian at all!). What makes this Daniele masterpiece so special? It's hard to say because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure it was the first time. I do not remember any other film of this type, no matter how many millions it cost or how big the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
