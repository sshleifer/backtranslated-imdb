I was 15 when this movie made its debut on television. Being raised in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This movie touched my impressionable teen heart and I remembered fondly the past 12 years. I recently got to see him for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th times thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the movie comes and touches my confused teenage girl inside.
