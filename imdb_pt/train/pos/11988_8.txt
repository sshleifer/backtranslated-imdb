I used to watch this show when I was little. When I think about it, I remember only vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the theme song. In addition, all were ideally chosen. Also, the writing was very strong. The performances were also top notch. I hope some network will bring it back so I can watch each episode. Before ending, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even if I do not think I have seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, if any net brings you back, I hope you take it one day before it's out of the air forever.
