David Beckham is a British soccer star and husband of Victoria Beckham ("Spice Girls Posh Spice"). Its trademark is a goal shot that curves across the field and into the net. The football equivalent of an ineligible curve ball in baseball. "Bend like Beckham" means making that kind of spectacular shot. In addition, and a small sanctuary for him in the main character's bedroom and a false cameo in the end, the film has nothing to do with him. The movie is full of football -Games, like the gift one of the characters' parents gave him in a shirt with the number 9 (owned by the great Mia Hamm, for those they know), references to " Posh 'n' Becks video pays homage to WUSA: one of the characters plays for an incredulous friend ("They * have * that"), lesbian jokes, sports jokes and so on. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenager in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional female league in the UK (hence her fascination with our WUSA), and her parents, who are established Indian immigrants in very old-fashioned ways. which do not allow daughters, among other things, to engage in contact sports. The girl's family is portrayed as an ironic figure, but with a lot of affection - think of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to go through the hell of a sitcom to hide their growing football stunt from them.
