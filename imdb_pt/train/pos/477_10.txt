Hi all I'm a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6. I suppose I'm very obsessed with chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this movie. In this film, the central character reflects a true chess player named Curt von Bardeleben, who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament room, never to return. <br /> <br /> The social ineptitude of the central character is unfortunately a treat for some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get at chess tournaments. I think chess is a great sacrifice, and sometimes you may end up unbalanced in other areas of life. An important example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, a world championship is shown, as between a great Italian master and Lujin. The format is a knockout, which in fact the world governing body of Fide sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to only 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also portrays a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The position before postponement creates a fascinating game of chess in itself. In fact, I made a youtube video about it, so you explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
