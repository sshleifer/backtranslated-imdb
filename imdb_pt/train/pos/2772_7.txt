I always believed that David and Bathsheba were a movie originally intended for Tyrone Power on 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck gave a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A lot of biblical subjects are covered in this movie, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, even a king in a prophet, biblically prophesied. You certainly have many pergeratives that are not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including one really cruel in Jayne Meadows, who was the daughter of Saul, the predecessor of David. But his eyes see Bathsheba in his garden one night. Turns out she's as unhappy with Uriah, the Hittite as David is for some women. Uriah is one of the captains of David's army. David commands that Bathsheba and he be the king, she comes running because she's watching him too. <br /> <br /> What happens, a case, a pregnancy and a carefully planned death for Uriah in a battle. But a Deity who sees everything and knows has taken all this and is not only punishing David and Bathsheba, but the whole Kingdom of Israel is being punished with drought, diseases and pestilences. <br /> <br /> The sexist law of the day asks that Bathsheba be put to death by stoning. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he climbs to the plate and asks that the whole thing be placed on him. He even puts his hands on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instant death, as seen in the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation is that God admires courage, even if you are wrong and he gives up on David. and forgive both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of various successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until both are conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is a compelling Bath-Sheba stuck in a loveless marriage with Uriah, played by Kieron Moore. The only thing Moore wakes up is a good battle. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave but rather stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can overturn the law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan, the Prophet, agrees with the character of John Brown that he played in two films, with the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So when his own law asked for death, why did God spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne? Maybe it was the fact that he just did not want to train a third guy for the job. He had already replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I think the Christian interpretation might be that this was a New Testament suggestion to be published, that one could sin and receive mercy if one asked for penance. I will leave it to Bible scholars to make interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you can create an entirely new theory.
