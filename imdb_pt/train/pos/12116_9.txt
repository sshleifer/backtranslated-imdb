... that Bette Davis' version of this movie was better than the version of Kim Novak. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even if the Novak version has <br /> <br /> However: raw emotions of Davis' Mildred seem more fit for a girl who seems to easily become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And it's those raw emotions that are part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, failure, "alterity" - strong emotions that he represses. Davis's Mildred, on the other hand, exhibits her emotions immediately and uncensored. It has no feelings of despair, failure or "otherness"; instead, she's just surviving like a poor cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novak's portrait was more vulnerable than Davis's, almost throughout the film. Mildred from Davis was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he criticizes her-by his method of keeping body and soul together, and by taking advantage of his love for her-she unleashed, no doubt, the most passionate repudiation of snobbery than the attitude seen on the screen: "I wiped my mouth I cleaned my mouth !! "Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> The votes of the IMDb match!
