It's a great American martial arts movie. The fight scenes were quite impressive for the American film made in the 1990s. Of course the fight scenes are not as good as the Honk Kong movies, in fact, only a few American films have fighting scenes that are as good as in the films of Honk Kong, to this day. When you watch American martial arts movies, you expect to see less impressive fighting scenes, but still have some good moves, which can be surprisingly good at times, or at least that's what I expect from these movies. I was impressed by this movie. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, the direction and the plot were good enough, so it's really a movie worth watching if you like American 90's martial arts movies.
