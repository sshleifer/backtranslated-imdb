I really think people are taking the wrong approach. First of all, I find this short film very fun and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation to the observer. Another thing that caught my attention was that this immediately engages the viewer, even if there is a clear story, just clues, pauses and emotions interpreted by the characters that give the impression that there is a story for everything that is going on. No one else could have done it better than Lynch. This is the essence of lincism at its best. Of course, I will agree with anyone that people who start seeing this with the desire to have fun without any really imaginative work on the viewer's side will be disappointed. And quite right. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one who helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is full steam here, and people who just hope to have fun like they're watching something else will simply not understand what it is. My opinion is that the Darkened Room has everything to do with messing up your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (image, sound, situation) by which you instinctively react. It's not about pleasure of any kind, it's about taking the desired reaction from you. And that, my friend, is pure art.
