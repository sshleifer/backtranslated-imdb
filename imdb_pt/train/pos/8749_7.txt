I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were a few bits that were not developed enough. I personally thought the girls were very insipid before they landed in jail; Of course, they should be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt they did not have that bond that best friends should have. For example, in the assembly you are seeing, the way you hugged yourself to the photograph was very strange. <br /> <br /> So there are some parts that are very ambiguous. I think it's very well understood that the Danes character did not do this, but I can see how this can be confusing. Besides, why did the camera pause in Manat with a very somber expression after he packed his suitcases in the trunk of the taxi? I thought I was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; She is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> In addition, I wanted to see that grumpy Thai prisoner being kicked. Talk about lack of closure ...
