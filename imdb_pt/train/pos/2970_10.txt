I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! The witty humor made me laugh all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so exaggerated boosts the comedy of the movie. <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies where you would never tire of watching it. I have a very short attention and I think this movie has so many funny parts that it keeps me amused everywhere. Funny quotations are memorable, and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later ... <br /> <br /> So I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should go see especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think it's strange that I like both? he he
