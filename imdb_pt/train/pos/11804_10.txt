Rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now, when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. Needless to say, there is a rule that made the film so much better. No conversation is allowed while the movie is on, unless the words are repeated in a corner. I loved the credit at the end of the movie too. "Thanks for the jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I say thank you because without your Jeep the movie may not have been made. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh about. If you want a good movie, maybe look for something else, but if you do not mind laughing at a man in overalls, get a copy.
