Recently, when I was shopping, I saw the Americian Gothic box-set, and I thought, "I remember that!" I used to set my alarm to go back and watch it when I was in CH 4 in 1996 at 1:30 in the morning (I was 14). I remember mostly because it was really scary and weird, no one could be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!) No one ever was anyway. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was that they did the same thing with the TV box. Episodes in funny order, I was wondering when Dr. Matt leaves? "They made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the fault of the writers, producers or directors (their TV people are in the background of the money makers They still do the same - Just look at shows like Carnival and Farscape they do not like of originality in studios !!!!!) <br /> <br /> To finish - If you have not yet seen this and it is called Fantasy of science fiction, Horror, supernatural drama..FAN = YOU MUST. They even said the same in SFX when reviewing the box.
