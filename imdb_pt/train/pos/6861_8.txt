When you compare what Brian De Palma was doing in the 1980s with what is now entertainment, his films continue to look better and better. "Dressed to Kill," "Blow Out," "Body Double," "Scarface," and "Carlito's Way" are superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the height of his powers. The face has had a long season of better than average movies. This is pure Hitchcock with a hint of perversion from the 80s, a tale caringly told of lust and murder with many twists and turns, great aids of style, an impressive score of Pino Donaggio and a priceless and giallo-inspired plot. Melancholic and bloodstained visuals and camera work help overcome logical holes, while the wonderful performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in himself), Nancy Allen (wife of De Palma at the time) and Michael Caine Let the virtuoso take you to a surrealistic, scary and erotically charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every "Dressed To Kill" picture.
