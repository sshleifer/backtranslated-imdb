Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild ride to watch. One day, I was just searching through my On-Demand list through the anime section and came across it, and decided to watch it. I spent all of the time basically sitting with my jaw jawed. All the time I was out of my mind, or there was a fugitive screaming, "TURN OFF !!!" But I did not. And, actually, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is impressive. Very artistic, strange and somber. I personally loved the incredible animation, but the seemingly empty story behind it is equally compelling to me. <br /> <br /> A boy - well, cat - goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part she is sick in bed and is soon paid for a visit from a kind of reaper. Your soul is divided in half. One is retrieved by the cat boy while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> So the rest of the movie is a bit lost for me, honestly. I hope they come back, and their world is ... maybe slowly falling apart? Perhaps his soullessness is the answer behind it, for the rest of the film contains several stages of which the world is. First, there is a giant flood and then dries up in a desolate wilderness and everything freezes (thanks to what is God or destiny, as you will see). So I believe they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange blossom. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, totally do not get it, but it causes shivers down your spine every time. <br /> <br /> Despite being seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind if you watch the movie enough and do some research. Personally, I love trippy things like this, and would like to spend time doing this just to understand this. But for some people, it's probably not your cup of tea. It sounds very disturbing, so if you like your anime straight, this is not a movie for you. If you have an open mind, however, I highly recommend this movie.
