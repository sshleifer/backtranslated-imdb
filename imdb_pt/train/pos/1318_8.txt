I felt compelled to write a comment for Space Cobra as it received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the comments at the time of writing me were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive comment will point people to this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space snake is the story of a smuggler and rogue who engages with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force that wants to harness the powers of the planets. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what is lacking in modern sophistication is made up of an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much aimed at a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few references, if any, to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. The Space Snake itself is witty and friendly. I can not say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the creator, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is constant action to take the story forward. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it starts out as a comedy and ends on a very pessimistic dramatic note. I can not think of another Anime or General movie that has been able to do it so perfectly and convincingly. You barely notice that this is happening, but it is done subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also feel that the characters have made a journey and their lives have been changed throughout the experience. Check it out if you can.
