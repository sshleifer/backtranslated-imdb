Some of my favorite movies of Laurel and Hardy have a very, very small plot. Instead, they give you a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest when you see the boys working or cleaning the house. Here in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is similar to these two other films - Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the movie trying (unsuccessfully) to clean the chimney of a crazy professor. Watching Ollie fall through the chimney, the boys making the house a total mess and Stanley's insane behaviors all work together to make a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> However, in a strange turnaround there is also a very strange Subplot that begins and ends the movie. It seems that the teacher is really a mad scientist and is working on a formula to make things younger. At the end of the movie, you see him making a duck in a duckling and even a duckling in an egg! Since he leaves the boys alone in the living room, is it surprising what happens next? Although this subframe was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What worked exceptionally well was the middle part. Do not let the boys do anything exciting and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. One of the best films on the team and almost earns 9.
