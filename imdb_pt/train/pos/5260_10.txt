Yes, it may be silly and it may not seem as funny as many high-budget comedies out there, but this movie is really hilarious if you really watch it. Tim Meadows always seemed funny to me on the Saturday Night Live show. Whenever he would do this character on the show I would laugh laughing. So, after I saw that it was going to play at Comedy Central one night, I decided to take a look. After all, I was very impressed with this movie, because it was not to win an Oscar or be a comedian of the year, but entertained Saturday Night Live fans who love the character Ladies Man. This film is also packed with a few highly quotable lines Which can be recited in the coming years.
