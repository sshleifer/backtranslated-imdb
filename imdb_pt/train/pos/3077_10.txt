I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on the ABC website during the summer of 2007. I'm absolutely crazy about the show. I think the whole cast is excellent. It's one of my all time favorite shows. I just checked the ABC program for this fall and did not see it on schedule. This is very sad. I hope they bring it back ... maybe they're waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it just my positive thinking? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments posted on the show and I see many brilliant comments, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully another season will pick up.
