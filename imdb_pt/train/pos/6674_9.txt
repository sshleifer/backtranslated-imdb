The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that its status as a bomb defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future this becomes a great success, and you can count on me among the fans. <br /> <br /> To simplify, and without giving much attention, this film makes for the comics what Princess Bride "did for fairy tales and" who framed Roger Rabbit? "made for classic cartoons.This should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the tone of the film than of the marketing committee for which it was unfortunately signed (this is one of those cases like" Iron Giant "where the studio had no idea of what he had in his hands.) Rent it the next time you feel like something a little weird. You will not hear the BeeGees any more the same way.
