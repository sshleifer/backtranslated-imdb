I am surprised at how many people give this movement less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing up in a difficult environment. There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there's a good reason so many critics like this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the reason is because they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the low score given by some people. <br /> <br /> I wish I could write a brief summary of a movie, but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I frankly have nothing more to say.
