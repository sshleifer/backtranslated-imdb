"Citizen X" is the true story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more attractive is where and when it happened; the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Light spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (magnificently played by Stephen Rea) is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the oblast militia of Rostov. He discovers unresolved murders of the past and the present, apparently by the same person. The murders are not resolved because no one bothered to properly investigate the evidence. He is led to find and stop the killer. Their only tools are their dedication, skill and honesty. Its obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. His naivet√© would have failed if it were not for his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even though the official line of the party is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. Locals and ensembles are perfect recreations of late-day Soviet life. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon, with intensity and pungency. This was a movie made by HBO Films and they became a great resource for movies that otherwise would never be made.
