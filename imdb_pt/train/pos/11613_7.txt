Distortion is a film that caught me by surprise. A kind of multi-layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right now. To be more concise, he feels that his wife is cheating on him, so he hires a private eye to spy on him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play are also having some punches that rolled up their sleeves playing with each other and with, say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. The whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable (but not really) happens. <br /> <br /> The director of the play actually keeps things moving along with the cast of characters, and edits in a way that makes you pay attention, this is a really fun movie, one that I do not care about to see and recommend people check out.
