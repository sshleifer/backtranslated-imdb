Woah! It's one thing I can say about this movie. Personally I am one of those people who love cats, which would have been a big negative point for the movie, but I loved how cats of all types got their revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very irresistible, I think lust got the best of me while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I was disappointed about. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was OK on Sleepwalkers, but pretty bad compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it's because Krause and Combs have a great chemistry or maybe more, a little more, that was the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was done with Brian Krause in those tight jeans he was wearing in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are accustomed to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of your son, your in. To a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like an angle boy. Although now I think about it, it would be great to see the character of Krause in Charmed taken by evil doing something similar to his in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the song was great in this movie. movie too!
