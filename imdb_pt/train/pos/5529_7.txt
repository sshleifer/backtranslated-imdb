I saw this movie for the first time in a theater in France a year or more ago. He came and left with little fanfare, but I liked the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating footage of wildlife. (The story, though cool, is really incidental.If you really thought about it, there's no way most things happen in real life.) I only saw it again tonight, here in the US, on DVD. Again, I understand that it has very limited distribution. Blockbusters only had one copy of it, and I do not remember playing in the art houses in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> Seen on my TV, the picture is not as dazzling, although it is still very beautiful. . Filming wildlife is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10 year old and the fox is even less convincing the second time around when you know where you are going. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said, the story is incidental. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like filming wildlife, you should find this fascinating.
