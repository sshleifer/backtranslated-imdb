I'm really getting old, I'm in the middle of watching this 40 year old movie, and I wonder what my grandchildren will be watching 40 years from now, it's an old saying, but they do not do it like that .. it's not only the story, is the music, the performance both by young and old.The cast, it seems, were born to play their roles, young oliver, old Fagin .. many to mention them all, the role played by the judge oliver is before, I've seen in other roles over the years ... the cunning cheater, Ron grumpy as Fagin, Mr. and Mrs. bumble, the movie not only won 5 Oscars, but took some gold globe awards too .. if you decide to see this movie .. do yourself a favor, take some, if not all children, to see this masterpiece
