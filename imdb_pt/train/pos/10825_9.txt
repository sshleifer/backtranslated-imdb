Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate when it comes to their TV work. However, his film work has been much more troubled (in 2008, The Bank Job was fine, the Across The Universe from the previous year was decidedly weak, for example). Still, Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. It has a great story, great performances, a lot of humor, fabulous music and, above all, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I like "moments," and this movie has one of them - only when everything is pear-shaped in the performance of the festival meeting ... <br /> <br /> Very nice .
