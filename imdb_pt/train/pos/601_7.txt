I was surprised by the low rating this movie received from viewers. I saw a late night on TV and it hit the spot - I really think it was in 1989 when it first appeared. I still remember it very well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting setting on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard seems adequately decadent for his role that well sums up the unfulfilled initial promise of his career, and everyone throws too much forward. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which may have looked a bit bold in 1989, now look docile, which is a shame considering that contemporary "nervousness" is often used as a marketing tool required. kind of like clamoring just to be noticed.
