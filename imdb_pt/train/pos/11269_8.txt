Ever wondered how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into practice? Well, unfortunately "City of the Convention" is lost, so well just have to watch "Tarzan and his partner" to find out. By 1934, there are a remarkable amount of sexual innuendoes and even exposed meat. Just look at Jane's swim. While Tarzan is often seen as a b-adventure movie made for boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. More than seventy years later, it's still as sexy as it was when she left. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that pushes the taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. I've always liked the jungle movies that Hollywood produced in the 1930s and '40s, but there are few of the genres that I would call great movies. "Tarzan and his partner" is by far the best film in this subgenre long gone. The sequences of the monkey or native safari attacks can still create tension today. Also, the animals are very cold (especially the monkeys throwing rocks). The acting will not win big awards soon, but it certainly is more than adequate for that kind of image. The movie is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most fun examples of Hollywood pre-code out there.
