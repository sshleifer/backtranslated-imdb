"A malefactor is often a man who left something undone, not always he who did something." - Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /> <br /> The DVD release of "Watch on the Rhine" could not come at a better time. He restores us a major piece by Lillian Hellman, adapted in an agitated way to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (the audio commentary of the Hellman scholar, Bernard F. Dick, affirms its authorship). Features a subtle performance of Bette Davis, who took a minor role after becoming the laborious queen on the Warner Bros. lot. Equally important, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose. <br /> <br /> Of course, you say, as if we need it. We heard Cary Grant's sermon in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We watched jackboots stomp the rolling hills in "The Sound of Music" (1965). We toured a Germany-occupied England in "It Happened Here" (1966). However, to tell you the truth, we still need the scattered message. <br /> <br /> I have an 81-year-old friend who regularly curses Franklin Roosevelt. He thinks FDR led the US into a foreign fight we did not need and therefore caused the death of his favorite cousin. He is encouraged in his demonization of Allied leaders and in the trivialization of the Second War by Patrick Buchanan. <br /> <br /> The political columnist recently released a heavy book with detailed research that claims that Adolf Hitler would not have posed any more threats. to Poland, Europe or the world if at least the Third Reich had received the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan asserts that if these selfish Poles had not faced the Nazis, attracting ungrateful Britain and unselfish France, no war would have swallowed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site feel that the "clock" sinks under the law. obsolete advertising weight. Perhaps. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seems to have understood the argument: some people hurt and kill to take the land, property and freedom from other people; such people dominated the Axis Powers and "enough" did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis have placed a compelling passion in their representations of refugees who are fighting the oppressors. They give an emotional blow to the intellectual case by leaving the scene, by actively facing torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not care for Lukas as a person since he became apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian, he had seen Bela Kun's bloody 'dictatorship of the proletariat' replace an outdated empire and then fall to Admiral Horthy's right-wing tyranny. In a wonderful special participation In Hammett's play, Henry Daniell ironically describes a Wehrmacht officer who disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would undoubtedly stay with Rommel Field Marshal in 1944 during the July 20 plot against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he pragmatically encouraged the Nazi cause, although he insults Herr Blecher "the Butcher" and despises the Romanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to sell information about a clandestine leader. <br /> <br /> Teck, a destitute and a possible horn, desires money and visa to return to Europe, where he can pick up the fragments of a life that has been disrupted by the Great War and the greatest global economic depression that has shaken the Empire. He has no political convictions, no scruples about exchanging a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends the old-world cynicism of the burned case as a desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives vitality to the hostess of man, a domineering girl who knows her mind and conquest. path - but who does not properly appreciate their children and their achievements away from home, she controls. She and her pale son from the office belong to the American version of the privileged type of von Ramme and Brancovis. However, this family has not seen the ruin and never will be. They are moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son could easily make choices that reflect this complacency about National Socialism and Fascism that flourishes today in my friend and commentator Buchanan. "Watch on the Rhine" has a well-kept period look. His dialogue reflects his erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets. However, the Hellman and Hammett film has a power based on the intestines. Audiences still need to listen and pay attention to the call to arms against the pickers relentlessly on the march.
