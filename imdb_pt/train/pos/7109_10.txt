First, let's start with the negatives: 1) There are ALL open spaces in history and issues raised that will not come close to being answered; 2) The movie is not for everyone, so unkind spectators will be restless and will start barking during the movie. <br /> <br /> The second point above is important because the film is very quiet. In an older theater type (like what I was), you can hear the reel passing through the projector at times. I loved it. The film does not leave you occupied with music, nor effects: it allows you to reflect on what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of pace that creates an atmosphere that is both fascinating and totally enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I recommend movie fans, since the film work is incredible. Those who base their appreciation for a film only in history will be utterly disappointed. It's the kind of story that you have to create the links in your mind after. (My version is pretty cool, but probably out of the way!) If you go to watch the movie, there's a really cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Let's take the hat off to the person who thought to do it.
