Let me start by saying that "War, Inc" is not everyone's cup of tea. It is, however, very enjoyable (and makes you think - "Oh, shit"). The comedy involved the film is not obvious at all - it's quite subtle (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning service, etc.), and changes with the twists and turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> I may be the only one, but I will not compare this to "Grosse Point Blank" because, it's different. John Cusack - I would not say he was "incredible" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, her sister (Joan Cusack) was amazing in her delivery of comic lines and timing - even if she was not in the movie (I'd say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a compelling reporter and manages to do that. Hilary Duff is very commended for her role as central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (though her accent is a little unreal). <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is what I would call "entertainment." . It does not have a particular plot, and sometimes it's silly, but it has a subtle message. I'd say it's worth watching.
