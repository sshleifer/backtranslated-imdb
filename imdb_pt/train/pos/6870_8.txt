From start to finish, I laughed a lot throughout the movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is possibly the granddaddy, even coarser, of all the skit comedy movies. This is the way I like to watch TV without getting bored in turning channels just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, the weird and weird humor never stops! Just think how all this nonsense can help you enjoy life more easily! It's like, better than Comedy Central or any show in prime time! Do yourself a favor and play all those romantic, soft and weak comedy movies in the trash! Better yet, tell your box office manager that you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
