* !! - SPOILERS - !! Before I begin, let me say that I had the two advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and having seen the "Authorized Version" of this movie, remade by Stephen King in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both advantages made me appreciate this version of "The Enlightened One," even more so. Also, let me say that I have read Mr. King's book, "The Enlightened One" on many occasions over the years, and although I love the book and am a big fan of his work , the retelling of Stanley Kubrick for this story is much more attractive ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche directly to the movies. In the direction of the film and the writing of the script itself, he acquired the title "Magus" without a doubt. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. His other outstanding credits include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; Mechanical Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. <br /> <br /> As Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel in the winter; Jack was hired as caretaker. It is your job to oversee the hotel's maintenance during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors. It seems that there are many wealthy and exhausted tourists heading to the Colorado mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lent itself to the atmosphere, by having a dark but at the same time "cozy" atmosphere, in itself. The furniture and furnishings were all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the landscape filmography that approaches the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. Not only does it allow you to take advantage of the Overlook approach, but it also fixes in your mind just how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the characters of Wendy and Danny was a stroke of genius. You see the whole history of their past, Danny's imaginary friend Tony, and Jack's alcoholism story, all in a cool introductory scene. There was no need to extend the past to more than two hours of the film; Obviously, Kubrick saw this from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing day. Again, the scenic drive through the mountains to the hotel (this time with the family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious, at the same time depicting a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial walk through Overlook is quite stunning, even though the "personal" is moving things, you will get the chance to see the majestic fire places, the cathedral high ceilings and expensive, dormant furniture and molding in architecture. "They did a good job! Rose and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "personal wing" is well designed and beautifully constructed. The labyrinth was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was the Guardian. When Jack Nicholson is in the tiered model of the maze and looks downtown, watching Wendy and Danny come in, it's a magical moment; one that tells you right away, there are strong energies in that house; There is something seriously wrong, already beginning. "I would not want to go there unless I had at least an hour to find my way." (The hotel manager) Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. Her smiles were natural and her performance was wonderful. You could really believe that you were there at the hotel, taking the kitchen tour with Wendy and "Doc". His explanation of "the brightness" for Danny was very well presented, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel. It was believable and sincere. <br /> <br /> The clipping of the hotel itself, with the mountains behind, the swirling cool air, the fog coming out of the snow-covered hotel's hot roof adds a lot to the movie's atmosphere. It also marks the point "halfway to hell," so to speak; the turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvall's portrait of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (So, what if she also played Olive Oyl? It just shows her wonderful diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I went back as soon as the film started. She's brilliant. In Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance so far (though I've loved her in "Roxanne" by Steve Martin). Once Kubrick has established the pearls information that you, the viewer, need to be in possession of: Torrence's past, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the hotel's own history, the fact that Danny is not "mental" , but rather clairvoyant, and the overall layout of the Hotel, all that you get in the first 3 sequences, the movie never stops to frighten you. <br /> <br /> The two daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady ( the girls showed up several times with Danny, first for Tony in the apartment before the family left for Otel) am icons with which Danny identified himself and, at the same time, feared. They were haunting (and haunted) themselves and showing Danny how and where they were killed, in a very graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Tony was written as an assistant spirit, as a spiritual guide that he acquired as a result of his arm almost being ripped from his body by his own father. He was ... "the boy who lives in my mouth." He would manifest at the end of Danny's finger and speak physically through Danny to talk to Danny. Not like in the book, I realize, where Tony was planned by Stephen King to be Danny's projection as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left out this little twist and somehow made it more scary when Tony "took ... Danny ... it's over". The idea of ​​Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self is not ... scary. The "Woman in the Shower" scene by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credit for having done anything before or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson also seems to suffer from the lack of credits for work before or after), was seductively obnoxious and totally disgusting. It was dramatic and scary. Disgusting and scary. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees his decomposing flesh under his hands; the look of pure terror on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly embarks on his journey of the alcoholic "jonesing" to a certifiable mad person. The degradation of the mental state of his character is carefully documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Barman (as only alcoholics, supposed mental patients and drug addicts) portrays his urgent need for the atmosphere that Lloyd uses; that is, alcohol ... "dog hair that bit me". (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no cost to Jack. "House orders." (Lloyd the Bartender) Good wordplay. <br /> <br /> When Wendy finds Jack's "script", it is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed several times, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. when he asks from the shadows, "How do you like it?" and Wendy spins and screams with the baseball bat in her hand ... it's so poignant. It's the point where she realizes how messy the whole situation is ... how messy Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and offers a strong presence. This, along with Danny's visions of the blood-soaked hotel lobby imposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the final confrontation to this scene, make this possibly the strongest scene in the film. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What I said? What mother would not be totally scared to wake up and find her troubled young son standing over them with a huge knife, talking to that weird little voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" over and over again? Even if it had no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something that everyone could (and must) remember (ed). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final attack on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the most scary scenes in movie history. His makeshift line, "Johnny from the Heeeeere!" It was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in horror history. It also falls into the horror film's history. <br /> <br /> The end ...? The end of Kubrick was perfect. I felt that ended beautifully. No smarm, no banal whining, no tears ending for this movie. Just epitomized perfection. That's all I'm going to say about the subject of the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares what was taken? Look what Kubrick put in. Rent, watch, buy. It's a classic in the horror genre and for good reason. HE LIKES !! <br /> <br /> * Me Being Me * ... Take this movie, and put it in your Stephen King collection, and take the "Authorized" version of 1997 made by King and put it in the children's section . That's where it belongs. .: This movie ranks 9.98 from Fiend :.
