Classic drama / Western action with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and you can say it was done with pride and love.Unique peek to the American pioneers of NORTHT WEST is very educational and entertaining.This film is much less rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "law men" during this particular time and place were very corrupt / corrupt like most developing countries today. The action sequences might have been more realistic, but still, this movie really covers most of the essentials. westerns type testoterone for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
