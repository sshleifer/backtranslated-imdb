My daughter, her friends and I have watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some girlfriends ran away with it. Later, I rented it so many times. It just never gets old !!! Blockbuster has no more in your listings and I've tried to buy, find, rent for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and is my favorite movie from my daughter's childhood ... it has everything! We laugh, we cry, we discuss real life and how much some kids have it in the world. There was nothing to fake about this movie. We relate to every second and every line Bill! Thanks to a million for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely yours, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, huh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August 2007 update: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who loves to choose to raise a child that is not his. It may not be mine or your life. It's not just believable, it happens every day. Thank God! Keep my faith in human nature alive !!! celebrate!!!!
