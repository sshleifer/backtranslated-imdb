For a low budget movie this was very good. I put it well above your average action movie B. Sean and Corinne delivered on this film, and they did not look shy with the camera. Watch out for the appearances of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think the producers would consider that, but the runners-up deserve a lot. <br /> <br /> I'll be looking forward to more of the involvement of Sean and Corinne in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very genuine, and Corinne's sexy character was quite intransigent and on the point. She connected well with the action sequences and performed with confidence. It was a great idea to launch Billy Zane as the clever and witty villain. Your on-screen charisma is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was very good. The action sequences were not extravagant and seemed to connect throughout the film. Of course there were flaws, but that comes with territory. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering they are newcomers to the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast have the chance to join their peers in the success of the entertainment as well. Final Judgment: *** / ****
