In my line of work, I am occasionally contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to get their movie out. When I can, I take a look at these low budget movies and often they make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs. Every once in a while, however, there is a film born of pure passion and desire, as if it were created with the purpose of reminding the film industry that good films are still possible. The short film BROKEN, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and deserves a second look. <br /> <br /> BROKEN tries to tell a convincing (but surreal) story with almost no 20 minutes. story back. The audience is thrown into the middle of the action with no clue what is going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from a dream to hear a shot and is kidnapped from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a band of mercenary bandits who seem to be at home in a comic book. These nasty guys and girls are bigger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The setback here is that despite being a low budget film, it does not work as one. From the beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N was filmed, edited and produced by professionals. It looks like something Quentin Tarantino could have done on his day off when he was playing with the Wachowski brothers. The film is crisp and cool, looks good and looks great. <br /> <br /> The acting is much better than I usually see in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the killer, Duncan) were well chosen. As two of the few roles that speak in the film, it is up to them to take the film. No special effect, no matter how good, would have saved this movie from bad acting. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey true fear and Gordon manages to emerge as a true psychopath. Some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by less talent but are hardly shown. <br /> <br /> The negative side of B R O K E N is that it is only 20 minutes long. The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that looks a bit artificial and is hardly subtle. Watching, I felt I should have some epiphany, but there was just a feeling that it was a lot more mundane than I had hoped it would be. The film struggles to be one of those puzzles that leaves the public chatting for hours at the local cafe, but that's unsatisfying. I keep thinking this is the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. <br /> <br /> MY RATING: 8 out of 10.
