Someone has mastered the difficult task of joining sports with romance. In fact, sports and romance go together like oil and water. So to put the two together on the screen ... well, that's equivalent to splitting the atom. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that, in general, I do not like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most movies about sports. This movie was a good mix of the two. Being a baseball fan, I really could enjoy the comedic ordeal with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) being a fan of Boston Redsox fans. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of Babe that plagued Redsox for 86 years, and they know how bad baseball players are about baseball. The Farrely brothers did a great job capturing this and made a good comedy. This was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
