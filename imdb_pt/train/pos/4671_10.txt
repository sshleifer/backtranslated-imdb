Many compliments to the writers of this film for creating an extremely engaging drama. The curious development of the character is indicative of a team of writers with nuances and good training. The audience member can not help but feel that he / she must make painful emotional decisions by placing the brain against the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character, although his predictions are rarely validated. <br /> <br /> Credit is also due to the filmmakers for inspiring life to the stage. Carpentry is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds, with its own traits, flaws, a variety of highly charged relationships and, of course, a fate inexorably linked to that of the other principles. <br /> <br /> Make sure you get this at your local art house.
