One of my favorites, this film tells of two "fiefdoms" New York fiefdoms, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), who both strive to be the "Big Guy" at Bowery in the late 19th century . Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although this is a heavily fictionalized account of his antics (based on one play). Brodie is legendary (he did (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here as happening at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). great affection for the period, so beautifully recreated here, and includes a rumbustious savage ragtime number of the singer saloon Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). Raft is at his smoothest as Brodie, and Beery again shows that intelligent actor he was, so hard , big heart, and sometimes quite touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest that both boys are seeking. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" moves at a fast pace (unlike many early "talkies") It's not an easy movie to find r, but worth looking for.
