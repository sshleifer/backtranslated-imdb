A solid B movie. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its discreet delivery is refreshing at a time of superior performance. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamics. Wendigo looks silly, but it's a representation of the boy's toy and the dead deer. It's an amalgamation like, see? This is a psychological story, not an instant satisfaction movie. Watch and reflect on your inner child and what the movie may have to tell you and you'll be fine. Good work.
