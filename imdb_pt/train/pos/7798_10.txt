I can not begin to describe how amazing this movie is. Suffice it to say that whenever I am depressed at how unfair or futile things are, this is the movie I am renting to put me in the right frame of mind. The background music makes you realize the ease of existence and how simplicity provides the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is just an example of a character in this movie who does not struggle, and is happy as a result. Persifina, Ruby's co-worker in the laundry room (Ashley Judd), is another: her eyes and smile can make a person's day more difficult. I watch this movie and dream about better days or a good conversation with friends, and I realize that being alone - Ruby is alone often enough - it's not the same as being alone. Recommended for those who like a thoughtful lull in a movie.
