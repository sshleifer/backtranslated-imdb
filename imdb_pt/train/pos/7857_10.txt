This film does not fail to get involved and move, even in 2008, to an audience that only knows the modern techniques of sound and computer overproduced. <br /> <br /> The experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see it. in a movie theater with other people on your big screen must have been truly profound and a completely satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> One might ask if a filmmaker can make a silent movie of two hours and make it interesting the same pace of structure and balance that this movie has. Silent cinema was pure art, it had to maintain attention through its structure, direction, and performance - there was no more filling with words or computer generated distractions. A badly made or uninteresting silent film is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> This film needs to be contextualized for those who may be baffled by the mention of Christian themes. This is not a 'Christian' movie, it is not selling anything. These themes, along with reference to current moral standards, often appear at this time - also the church that goes on Sundays was a national past time, Christianity was given in most families, so the film represents only normal life as it was So. The themes would have been true and profound at the time. <br /> <br /> It is very strange, given the strong support for good Christian thinking in this particular film (and one is not preaching religion to anyone, only highlighting the difference between the hypocrites and the honest) that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative of the film industry with a large crowd denounced Pickford as an example of immorality along with some other individuals he quoted. NY Times 1922. Maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and learned a few lessons. <br /> <br /> The pastor complained that since the film industry had begun the church's share dropped 500,000. The representative of the film in the debate, however, made the following remarks; that the saloon frequency had also dropped, that there were many more pastors trapped than actors (fact) and that selecting some examples among the many was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> Thus, there was a continuing battle between the church and the film industry during the early days of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie about being honest and truthful with family friends and being willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, resolute, full of joy and happiness, faithful, humorous and quietly sacrificed - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character. This, however, is not thrown in our throat, but revealed little by little through the film. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese movies where the characters are slowly and languidly revealed throughout a movie. time that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It has a smooth and even rhythm for the first time that builds all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes are great for making movies and should be enjoyed if it was achieved without the benefit of sound, running the dialogue - it was achieved through agile acting and great direction. Sometimes it's surprising to realize that at the end of the movie you do not hear a spoken word, but it sounds like you've heard it all. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast did great performances especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are Pickford's typical mood as she leaves the stage under the pretext of sweeping the snow, a near-perfect balance, and the end. This is a special kind of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin used this device frequently and copied some from Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special note to be made about Silent movies and especially about Pickford is that the star often needs to hold the camera for most of the film without the camera. the audience gets bored or bored with overexposed actors. That Pickford is usually the center of attention through most of his films, but people still have not gotten enough of it is a testament to his ability to perform well.
