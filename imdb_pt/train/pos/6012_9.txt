Antonioni was pointing to another hip masterpiece, this time across the Atlantic than "Blow up." It was not success with critics and youth as the first. Because? Perhaps because it was a European vision of America full of clich√©s that did not work and did not age well. (The revolutionary students at the outset are embarrassing.) Perhaps when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the young market seemed dated. If it had been released a year before maybe the hippies in the deserts would have looked like new ... It's a very interesting movie, very well filmed with some brilliant Antonionian scenes in the middle, like the act of making love in the desert, the stillness of the mansion of the desert and the explosive ending ... That the protagonists were two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is a little better than Daria Halprin. It would have been much better with appropriate actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite funny and touching at times, although you do not know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting document about the ending of the sixties is definitely worth looking at for the picture and the soundtrack ....
