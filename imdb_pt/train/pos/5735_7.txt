This is a short and rudely animated series by David Lynch (as he says at the beginning), and follows the misadventures of a large, general-looking man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an irritating son. Both elements are played repeatedly in short episodes, and there is no real plot to be seen. It's easier if you think of it as an exceptionally strange, slightly macabre Looney Tunes - with a lot more blood, swearing, bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarity. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD along with Eraserhead, having Eraserhead seen earlier. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic work of art - that's anything but. In fact, it seems to be almost a statement against such things, since his rough style spits before any kind of animation convention you can see. As Lynch says, "If this is funny, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of everything."
