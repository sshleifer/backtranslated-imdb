This is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen, and, in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that you really get it all! <br /> <br /> This movie definitely reaches my top 5, and should be enjoyable for all movie lovers. The action sequences have the traditional unreal leap and even fly, but the way it is filmed differs a lot from the style of the Hero and the flight always looks great and usually even makes sense (the ghosts can fly) Watch this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
