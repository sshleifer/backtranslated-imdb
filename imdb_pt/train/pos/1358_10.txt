Season after season, the players or characters in this program seem to be people you absolutely would love to hate. Is this show manipulated to be this or were they chosen for the same? Each episode vilifies a single person specifically and he ends up being killed. You like to see them get screwed, even though you're totally wrong and sick. You like to see them fucking with each other, get screwed, play dirty, get back, escape and finally get kicked out by Trump. The amount of tears also seems to be increasing in season. <br /> <br /> The rewards that try to make up for the humiliation and suffering of the past are also greatly reduced. In more recent seasons, it's like "You get to know xyx that will give you a lecture on uvw" ... like who cares? Are the characters so palpable, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only sensible person can win. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully and keep your conscience. These are your fellow human beings in the line of fire.
