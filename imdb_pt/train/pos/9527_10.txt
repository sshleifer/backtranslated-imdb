This is the best Mafia movie ever made. He deserved more than he earned at the Oscars. Named for things like his score, art direction, supporting role (Newman), this movie could easily have been nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the boy who played Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised I do not see him in more movies today. The critics themselves did not give enough credit to the film. But beyond the incredible performances, another real star of this movie is the incredible music. This was by far the best score of the year. He was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. My grade-A +
