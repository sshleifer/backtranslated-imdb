I can not believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. This is Laural and Hardy. Brighten it already. These two were a tumult. Your comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. It was not a foul word from any mouth and they were able to keep the audience in stitches. His comedy was by no means sophisticated. If a whoopee cushion can not make you smile, there is no reason to watch any of the things these guys did. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were funny without a plot. I think it's very simple to like this, so I qualify. Comedy teams of two men do not compute, we are very sophisticated ... Are not we fortunate?
