I think this show is frighteningly funny! It's not for everyone, and I will not elevate or denigrate people who do not understand it. I'm sure they are wonderful and brilliant people who operate on a different wavelength. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a self-infatuating loser called "Sarah Silverman," who often finds herself in Homeric impasses (which is "Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief Saturday Night Live show in the early 90's. I liked her right away and I got out of my way to check out anything she did. <br /> <br /> This show is funny, choking and fun. Therefore, I always fast before watching and using diapers for adults. Check out!
