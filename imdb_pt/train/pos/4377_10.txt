The beginning until the mid-1990s was a high point, in my opinion, for the historical drama. Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all portrayed a distinct passion and intensity in their respective periods of time. Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by the movies. It really has it all - interesting history, great acting, remarkable dialogue and breathtaking landscapes. I was particularly impressed by the seemingly genuine dialogue. I can imagine that's how people from the early 18th century spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it to be more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle, than most found in movies set in modern times. The film had a very bold and sexually charged advantage that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the time. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tight, with a hardly monotonous moment. There was a lot of intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit, but they did not diminish the main plot. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and exciting. Something that I will always consider remarkable is that during the featured action in the movie, there is no soundtrack. It is a very tense and exciting sequence, since we have no musical clue as to the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always remain at the top of my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
