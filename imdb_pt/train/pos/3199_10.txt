Okay, I really do not think Trailer Park Boys has any bad plot because they kick it. They just ... come into conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: Near the end of the movie, he shows Ricky and Julian saying "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog on the ground and walk away. So, in the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying they've been in jail for two years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip from Ricky and Julian yelling at "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series, they were supposedly only arrested for 18 months. <br /> <br /> In addition, they give us the impression that the plot of the film and the history of the TV series are connected (because of the glaring scene between the faces). But some actors portray totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the film, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys that Ricky pays for an extermination, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys smell coca instead of smoking. The thing is, they never confirm that the two story lines are connected anyway, in addition to the glaring scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to keep chattering.
