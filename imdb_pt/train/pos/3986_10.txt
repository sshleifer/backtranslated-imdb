I am a college student studying levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any thoughts on the subject of mothers in the movies, in the mother. If you went through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this movie, any comment would be greatly appreciated. Comments will be used for examination purposes only and will be included in my written exam. So if you have some point of view, I'm sure I can put them into use and you can help me get an A! I'm also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole', so if you've seen these movies too, I'd appreciate it if you could leave comments here on this page. Thank you.
