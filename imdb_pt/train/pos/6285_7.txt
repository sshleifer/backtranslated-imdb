What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, expect him to be full of action. <br /> <br /> In Bruckheimer's last film, Gone in 60 Seconds, it's all about nomenclature. With character names like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx, and cars designed with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's just the uninterrupted action that keeps you from just wanting to play the name. <br /> <br /> It's not a deep script but it's a great vehicle for action as Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall comes out of retirement from the car to save the life of his brother, stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the cult success of 1974, this movie can not be aimed at the same cult status, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching, not acting. Though star-studded, none of them have outstanding performances, including a very weak performance from one of my favorites, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, coming off her recent Oscar win, is just a symbolic love interest, with almost no screen time. <br /> <br /> A series of beautiful cars and the pursuits of cars in which they engage can make a great movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to see and although a particular scene takes you to the realm of unbelief, the action is uninterrupted and the suspense is compelling. Just be suspicious of other riders fighting for a pole position as they leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
