I'm glad I saw this movie have seen some of the director's other films in the past. I found the optimal production figures like the costumes and scenarios with the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons was treated. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes. They were hard to follow sometimes. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a moral tale. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought of the movie. It's a movie I'd like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like those in which Benkai and the Prince were fighting on a "psychic" level were well done. <br /> <br /> left the cinema thinking about what just happened here. Intense.
