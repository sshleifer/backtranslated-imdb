Tom, the cat, Jerry the mouse, and Spike the Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second being 'Assassin') decide to sign a peace treaty for everyone to love. It's weird and a little unnatural to see them all friends like this and their friends seem to think so too. But in the end, thanks to a disagreement about a steak, everything went back to normal and this is how it should be. This short is the second of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no idea why. This cartoon can be found on DVD one of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My Note: B
