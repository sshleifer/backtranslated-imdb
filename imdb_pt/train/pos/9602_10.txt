Darius Goes West is a film that portrays the American belief that anything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful, fun-filled and sometimes moving movie features a young man who never expected but was eager to see what was outside the confines of his lovely city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius's wish come true. They started small - Ben & Logan's mother started an e-mail campaign to bring awareness to Darius' condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and raise funds for the guys to lead Dario not only to see the ocean but also to see these great United States. To say that the young college classmates were able to bring hope and awareness to this terrible disease would be a euphemism. They realized the dream of Darius and then some. They put their lives on hold while demonstrating love, affection and a lot of fun for Darius while helping Darius see how he can in turn show those same characteristics to others suffering from DMD. Darius volunteered for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair, collecting money (along with his friends) outside a local grocery store. Your wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Dar Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one deserves more. Martha Sweeney.
