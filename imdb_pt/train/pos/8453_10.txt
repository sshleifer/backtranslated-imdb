I could write a big enough comment about any of the characters in Gundam Wing, they could lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we have 8 great tracks that take us through 49 golden episodes of Anime Bliss. <br /> <br /> It contains dialogues that you can roll in your head for months ... years, and then come back and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical feature of I wish there was a disparity between subtitles and dubbing in English). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own points of view. <br /> <br /> Relationships between cold and insensitive males and amorous female characters is an independent aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch. Man's apparent rejection is sustained by an inner turmoil that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary to them in their hostile hostile environment. Women are pursuing aspects of men we rarely see, which makes men more enigmatic. Heero takes all 49 episodes to show some affection, but he gets there, and when that happens, it's a great reward. <br /> <br /> And then there's the giant robot struggling. Fun to watch stunning sequences and any epic Hollywood fight scene. Any less insightful person would see the giant robot struggling as a silly cartoon role for kids, as it was clear when I'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. Many of the giant robot fights in the Gundam Ward contain a good dose of ducks, often involving young rebels struggling for what they believe against an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> The constant changes of tone and emphasis through each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating study, provoking thought about the potential of the mind and the human body.
