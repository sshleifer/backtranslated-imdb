I've never watched the midnight screening of a movie before "Dick Tracy" leaves. <br /> <br /> I still have the "ticket t-shirt" that I had to wear to be admitted to the exhibit here somewhere like that shirt, "Dick Tracy" stayed with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you saw the film, the clear visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters were undoubtedly engraved in your brain. It's a wonder to see. As director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what works in a movie and shows here, picking up a familiar American icon and recreating it for a full time. new Age. Still in the thirties, "Tracy" has a kind of timeless quality as all good movies do. I've lost count of how many times I've watched "Tracy" and I still get something new every time I do. <br /> <br /> The others are all top-notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Mahoney Breathless Mahoney is a relief in that under the environment Sure, she can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still issues like family need, staying true to yourself, good against evil, even Machiavellian themes are explored. Strange for a comic book movie, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic in itself. Compared to other films this decade, it makes a strong statement. It's a good, strong movie that does not depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to show its point. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
