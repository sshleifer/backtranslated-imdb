One of the best movies out there. Yes, perhaps cinematography was not the best, but a great plot and concept. Great for the weather and bright and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and a lot of fun. One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative films. After World War III and fighting in giant robots, the actors did a great job and made it all worthwhile. The sets are not surprising, but simple and worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I loved it since it came out. It's not a conventional movie and it's not like anything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a great view and a lot of fun.
