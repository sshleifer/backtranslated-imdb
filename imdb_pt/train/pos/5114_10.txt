Although Urban Cowboy did not leak with the same testosterone you could find in a rodeo, it provided an accurate view of that day and age in urban Texas. I also think that in order to really criticize this film, someone would have to have lived in the time and place relative to where it was made. There was good music, fun times, and, yes, some "rough and tumble" in tonky honky road houses. Bud and Sissy's relationship, like "two ships passing in the night," was well conceived. When Pam tore the note Sissy wrote to Bud, it echoed the tragedy of many real-life novels. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did a great job. I thought the screen was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor.
