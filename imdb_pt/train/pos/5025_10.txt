Dude, some of you have to relax. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can not you understand that it is a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment, for God's sake (no pun intended). It seems to me that a lot of people here are trying to be film critics - and they are not doing well. I am so impressed with the film and the work of Bill Paxton in the direction that I will contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you were not trying to analyze the possibility of the story, you could just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did!
