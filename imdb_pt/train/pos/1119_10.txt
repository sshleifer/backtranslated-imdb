Without You, I Am Nothing, by Sandra Bernhard, the film was released in 1990, followed by its 1988 off-Broadway theatrical production ... which she and others refer to in the film as their "one woman show." "<br /> <br /> There have been several changes in the monologues and one-liners, and the film version visually revises the story, taking Sandra from a fabulous existence as a stage performer to success in New York, during what she calls from her "summer superstar," to an almost hopelessly illusory existence at her Los Angeles home - her fictional director in the film refers to her as bringing back Sandra "to her roots, to ... sophisticated clubs like the Salon Parisian "<br /> <br /> There is a point to be made here. <br /> <br /> Sandra tries to appeal to her liberal worldview and the sometimes harsh criticisms of American pop culture to an audience that does not see her completely. playing for a predominantly black audience, trying to relate their ideas when all these people seem to want is "Shashonna," a stripper similar to Madonna. at there is much to be said for the public's enjoyment in the program. The scene in the club throughout the movie is drier than a bone. A funny scene to catch is from a rotund man in the audience helping Shashonna take off his pants. <br /> <br /> But if she's going down, Sandra is doing it with style and strength, conveying everything from a lack of confidence to a punch. vulnerability ... straight to the point where she is naked (literally), begging for acceptance and still somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom. His depictions of interactions with the likes of Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we are led to believe is) Warren Beatty are fictitious and hilarious. Sandra begins her show at its most embarrassing moment, presenting a silent but mystifying rendition of Nina Simone's "Four Women", dressed in a mufti and other African costume, singing lines like "mine skin is black, "" my hair is woolly, "and" they call me Sweet Thing. "<br /> <br /> She resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of the underworld's art in a tremendously funny description of the frantic real estate auction for Andy Warhol: "Let Andy have the wisdom and the sensitivity for the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the Indian product ... that they were lucky enough to profit from all this Santa Fe thing going on. She exposes the excess of Hollywood, comforting a distracted friend, then admonishing him, saying, "Lord, if this is about Ishtar, I'm getting up right now and getting out of your life forever, because this is very self-indulgent, even for me! "<br /> Sandra illustrates the women in the era of feminism. Dressed like a Cosmo girl, Sandra recounts her fantasy as a young woman to become an executive secretary and marry her boss. She finally concludes with relief: "I'll never be a statistic, neither will I. I'm under 35 and I'm getting married!" Sandra exalts the openness of sexuality in society: "When it touches you at night, does it feel good, or does it seem real? I say it looks real ... POWERFUL." <br /> <br /> Finally, she cries for change in the progressive The American society channeling the big names of the nightclub Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and proclaiming: "Eventually everyone will funk!" <br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of glitzy, schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances from songs written and originated by Billy Paul. , Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, to name a few. At the same time, Sandra's idealized and fictional incarnation - her self-generated mirror image - floats around the city, a beautiful black model in fluttering dresses and tight bustiers reading Kabbalah, studying chemistry, and listening to NWA rap music. In Without you, I am nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores emotions and existences that, until then, she had only played as a regular guest on Late Night With David Letterman. His almost childlike enthusiasm for the shock, played out throughout the 1980s, is brushed aside by a subtler fascination, and his confidence in the face of materialism and American celebrity is refreshing. This approach to comedy would change Sandra's direction forever and mark the maturation of the more mature and presentable artist. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in jokes about glamor, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and superficial expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you on points. It may not be made to be funny across the board. Maybe it's a little unsettling or even corny for some. But consider the emptiness of the world Sandra paints for you, and you'll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But see Without You I'm Not Nothing with a friend "in the know" because it's definitely funnier like that. Before you know it, the two of you will be barking Sandra's barbs and confusing all the others.
