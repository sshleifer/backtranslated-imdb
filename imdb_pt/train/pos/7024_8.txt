I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so I thought I'd take a look. I thought it was a very beautiful movie and I can not wait to see it again. the actors were very good and I loved all the music! there was not much talk in the movie, which at first seemed a little strange - but by the time I got to it, I thought the story and acting were really emotional and meaningful and I thought that left a lot to the imagination. I want to see the movie again because there was so much that I forgot a lot of small things, but I know I left the theater thinking about the movie. was filmed beautifully and the whole thing was really unique.
