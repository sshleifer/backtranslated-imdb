This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes and 9 seconds and 1 frame of artists from around the world. Documentaries are varied and deal with all kinds of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme (much smaller in some cases). Some of the segments are weak while others are very strong; some are political, others are not; some are just about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch the human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This movie has not been censored in any way by anyone, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments can really irritate right wingers (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits, another from the UK recounting the overthrow of Chile backed by the US on September 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrific atrocities). The segment of Mexico was the most powerful, counting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in a vivid way (you have to see to believe). <br /> <br /> Even though the final product is uneven, with some segments almost "useless," I still recommend this. It is very difficult to classify this film because the segments vary all over the place (some weak, some very powerful;). I am giving it a rating of 9 out of 10, simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that are generally censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
