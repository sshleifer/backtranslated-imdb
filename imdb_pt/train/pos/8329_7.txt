A solid movie, if not noteworthy. Matthau, like Einstein, was wonderful. My favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see it again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badminton, I loved the sweaters and the conversation as they waited for Robbins to retrieve the bird.
