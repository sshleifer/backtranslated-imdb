Kurosawa, completely renovated, loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing view of the favelas of Tokyo. Kurosawa spans a style that was, in my opinion, its antithesis - that is, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to take a picture of Ozu. Badly rhythmic, ill-conceived, this film is a rare failure in this author's body of excellent work. While Ikiru, while mundane and depressing, was still interesting and well-paced, and while Stray Dog portrayed favelas and social poverty in Japan without being too heavy or boring, desu ka den is all too dark to expect content , without any of the redeeming qualities of previous Kurosawa photos. <br /> <br /> Be warned, this is not a movie for which Kurosawa should be tried.
