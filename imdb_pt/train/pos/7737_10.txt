If you are as great an author fan as I am of Jim Thompson, you can be quite dishonest when your works are turned into film. This is not the case with Scott Foley's version of After Dark My Sweet. A classic noir of suspense and sexual charge that follows closely and does great justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward are possibly the best performers of their careers. And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern might even have gotten over this. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a gloomy and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never that far away. A must see for all fans of the great movie noir. **** !!!
