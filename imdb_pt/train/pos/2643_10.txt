I really can not say much more about the movie plot that has not yet been said. I have not seen the movie for about 25 years and the memory of it never left me. I've been searching everywhere. I've done net searches for him in the past, but I've come empty. Last night I was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but I was only 10 or 12 when I last saw it and I was not sure if I had the right movie name so I decided to do another search and I finally found this vision. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please leave me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com I really appreciate it. And for those who have not seen this movie and have a chance to be worth it.
