I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So in my last years, I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or if there really was something in that movie. To my surprise, the film kept my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotionally in the right amount, some jokes, cool songs (not great, and that explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and overall a great use for my time. I was surprised that the last films of my childhood that I revisited did not even pass my minimum requirements of a decent movie and still this film, that I saw for the first time in the second series, made me cry today, as well as made me cry, then. Maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make movies (this and money, of course). Yes, there are continuity failures. Yes, the script has holes, but that does not matter. The movie itself is fun and clever. So do not be fooled by cynical people who always look at the bad things in life because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it's perfect. It's 10 simply because it made me feel.
