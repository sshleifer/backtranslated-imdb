This film is provided by David Shepard and Kino in the Before Hollywood program in Fort Lee, NJ, although it is an abbreviated version with only the behind-the-scenes sections. I'm not sure if Blackhawk Films only had one movie printed these parts, or they have edited the other scenes. The original version of Blackhawk was renamed to A Movie Romance, but the pre-print of this version had some nitrate decomposition, and some sections looked bad, so that may be why the Blackhawk version was edited. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film has Tourneur playing himself, or more likely a caricature of himself. Supposedly, director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg may also be <br /> <br /> Country girl Mary (Doris Kenyon) yearns for a romantic man to make her stand up. She dreams of a troubadour who will court, but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy, Johnny Applebloom. Meanw However, a film company in New York (actually New Jersey) is filming a western in the hinterland. Mary sees an Indian (with headdress) and fires an alarm - spoiling a scene that the producer films. She is immediately attracted to movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encourages her to leave her at home and try to become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When she gets to the studio, she finds out that everything about the movies is fake. The doors and walls are just apartments that are quickly assembled for the whole. That slim walk of the western hero or the happy leap of heroin is also acting. The sets are in a large rotating stage, so the angle of the sun can be manipulated. The black studio attendant signs all the "autographed" photos of movie stars. The signs on the wall say "positively no smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the movie titles (which are well illustrated) emphasize all that is false about the life of making movies. <br /> <br /> Film actress Driscoll is so disenchanted with the noise of making movies on a daily basis. He does a temporary separation from girlfriend Vivian (June Elvidge) to chase this "exciting" country girl. Her plans are thwarted when Mary's screen test is bad. We did not get to see the actual movie, but only the public's painful reactions to it. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to admit to everyone that she was a failure, so she continues to see Driscoll and we lunched with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as police officers, soldiers, cowboys, etc. <br /> <br /> Maria decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with the movie "friends", she agrees to marry him, although there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, her mother appears, with a cake especially for Mary's birthday. This makes Maria reevaluate her future. <br /> <br /> This movie has all kinds of fascinating scenes from studios, movie sets, changing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you ever imagined what happened behind the scenes when a silent movie was being made, this movie lurks behind the curtain.
