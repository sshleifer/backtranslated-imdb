I watched this show based on the fact that it was said to be reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show I love. The show quickly begins to introduce us to the main characters and a little unusual that the pilot episode is for me the best of the group, it is extremely dramatic and really takes the whole evil side of the show ready to progress for the rest of the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt a bit disappointed with the show - probably not because of its own fault, since it was canceled after only 1 season, it seemed to show a lot of potential and deserved a much better treatment than the one obtained. The acting is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and bad) I've seen and who are well developed in a short time. There is the weird cheese effect for the first 5 or ten shows that are a bit overly dramatic but this is corrected as the season progressed. Worth seeing, definitely something out of the ordinary!
