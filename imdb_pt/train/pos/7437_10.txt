Recently, a friend and I were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950s versus today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in 1798 wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. We had both been obliged to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in English Literature courses in college. My friend said, "Your messages may even be called metaphysical in the present context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and we only remember pieces. (I have trouble reminding Dr. Seuss.) I said I would get two copies of the poem so that each one could read. That was easy enough, but I was extremely surprised to discover that it had been made into a film. We look forward to watching the movie to see how it was played. After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly light reading. After each one read the poem, we watched the movie together. <br /> <br /> We consider the film a remarkable achievement, especially considering it was made in the 70s, before computers, before the so-called "Ken Burns Effect". "and before special effects began to make up for the lack of substance. Particularly noteworthy are the illustrations of the 19th and 20th centuries, selected from lesser known artists such as Willy Pogany, the first Hollywood stylist. <br /> <br /> The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, who had taught the poem when he was a teacher, adding a tone of authority and credibility to remain faithful to the poem.His mastery is in the layers of subtle messages conveyed without "instructing "or become a tale of oppressive and obvious morality.We find that it is such a refreshing change from the mentality of today's 'in your face' and 'spanking their heads.'" Most of today's moral messages in the movies are two-dimensional: The bad guys are very, very bad and good are super heroes It's as if the human character had no nuance The Old Sailor's Time is a celebration of the individual, character, an appreciation for celebrating all the wealth that life has to offer, within the broader context of humanity, that is, man's ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud of ourselves for finding this "unknown" gem, we learned that it had won the top prize in its category five-six times at international "name" festivals. Another surprise was to learn that the director of the film, Raul da Silva, is a recognized authority at the beginning of the animation, and author of six award-winning books on film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is as relevant today if not more so than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and when Raul daSilva translated it into film. If I was still teaching in high school, what I did for five years, I would take this one and show it to all my students. There is a level of wealth here which naturally leads to the discussion of the great and important issues we all face, whether in 1798, 1978 or today - indeed, as long as humankind has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
