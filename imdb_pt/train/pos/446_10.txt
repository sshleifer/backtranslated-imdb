One of my favorite movies of all time. Just beautiful, full of human emotion, intelligence, humor, intelligence. The story grows, just like the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is also fantastic ... a great selection of the best British talent around. I loved them all for every different element brought to the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to make a story like this, - everything about this movie works. I love it :)
