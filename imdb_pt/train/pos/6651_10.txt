Gandhi the Great: <br /> <br /> The greatness of the world is associated with people like Alexanader, the great, Ashoka the Great, for his greatness, lied to being glorified as more than human. Gandhi is called great because he is not really a Great but is more human because I always believe that bringing humanity into us is where the greatness of being human resides. Gandhi was a human with humanity and someone who struggled for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity, but not his enemies. Let me move on to review the movie now. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi My father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father is a film not about Gandhi but about his son Harilal Gandhi. In telling the story of a son whose father was one of the the greatest humans to walk on this earth, the director manages to portray the story. The film succeeds in telling the story of a son of a deceitful father who leads a nation to greatness. The film is termed as a criticism of Gandhi's failure as the father of his son, I prefer to say that it is a sacrifice that Gandhi made as the father of a son to do justice as the father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I wish the essence of this film prevails not only in India, in the land of the Gandhi, but through the hearts of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, the true Human.
