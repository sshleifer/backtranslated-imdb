This movie is incredible! Although funny and fun, it is also profoundly profound and revealing. I'll watch again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it is not what he thinks will be needed to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and resentful that his life is not what he imagines he should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything he finds wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to achieve everything he has ever wanted. His life is finally exactly what he imagined it would take to make him happy ... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses the person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce discovers that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspiring and profound. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a profoundly humiliating respect for the fact that, most of the time, we are much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition: "Let us not lose ourselves and those who matter as we try to discover."
