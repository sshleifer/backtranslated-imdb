This is the best film ever made to deal with the AIDS issue. It's a documentary about two men living and dying of this disease. The film is beautiful, touching, funny and incredibly exciting. Above all, it's an incredible story of true love. Make sure you have some wipes ready before watching this movie - you'll need them. Extraordinary.
