I'm not sure if anyone can call this an anti-war movie, it shows war on an elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and are proud of it. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy the skill level and defeat their enemies, even if it is against a pacifist. Movies are slow and uneventful and, in many ways, they are tamer than war movies - by today's standards, with no flying body parts like modern movies. It is brutal in other ways, as you see killing on a personal level. This is one more movie of the man who thinks. When you start watching, you will not want to miss a thing. The thoughts of men in the film and their interactions, is what the film is about - not the combat itself or a great thrilling story. This can be called a war triller. <br /> <br /> If you like war, if you are reading or watching programs on SAS and so on, YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable movies are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with a cast of stars, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are uncommon in their path and show war on a personal level. Appreciate!
