Of course, the Battle Star Gallactica "Sci-Fi" medium fan will hate this. This makes me happy. I do not like these science fiction movies especially the Star of the Gallactica Battle and that's why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the program received a lot of heat for doing so (unconventional science fiction). -fi way) and it was worth it. I read on the Wiki that they wanted to appeal to everyone, including women and not just science fiction nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising program since Lost. He has the most interesting, clever and profound script of any show at some point and is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I love the most about the program is that it looks like a great anime! From young teenagers running around shooting weapons, and extremely well-balanced and complex, robots remind me of something that came from Japan except a little better (most Anime is very confusing).
