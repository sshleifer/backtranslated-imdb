This movie started slowly, then gained strength in the middle. However, the fact that the film lasted two nights broke that momentum into the heyday. The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending. Playing football in the yard? Could you really be more sentimental and mushy? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s. I will not make any great effort to tune into that if it's something like "The Sixties."
