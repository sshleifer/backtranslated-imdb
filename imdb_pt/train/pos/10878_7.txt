Personally, I enjoyed cutting deeply. It was the first time I saw an Australian movie slasher released in theaters. A genre usually restricted to major Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> With all the comedies and dramas typical of Australia, I loved being able to see a home-made horror movie that was not a steal of anything. I did not even think it was really a parody of other movies. It was a supernatural horror theme like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or I know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief. I think it's high time the Australian movies tried to dig deeper into the main genres. <br /> <br /> The cut was original, scary enough and, ultimately, just a little fun. I would give it seven out of ten and would not treat it as something serious. He did what I expected, entertained and scared me enough to be satisfactory. I liked.
