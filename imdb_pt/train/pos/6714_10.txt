Why did I enjoy the show until the last episode? Because of the true talent that Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting cast had to demonstrate that humor, comedy, light humor and deep thought could actually coexist. What I liked the most was the fact that I could go home after a hard day's work, and break a smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to see how this magical person was so happy to help others. Sabrina was a hero in my opinion ... even if she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from ours ... to very different; she had powers at her fingertips, desires and commands that could be used for good or ill, which can only exist in many of our imaginations. Almost everything we see, have, know, possess or even desire ... can be used for good or evil, and as we choose to define it, it defines the person we are. <br /> <br /> She traveled the world and other realms with these constant and unattainable ideas in mind ... to learn, live, laugh and love. She was always learning to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around her; she made mistakes while living life, going through different growth days, like her, her aunts, and Salem (the underestimated but imperfect hero) did well to demonstrate that, even with mistakes, you can still be noble, talented and wonderful . <br /> <br /> She also demonstrated many altruistic, apprentices and loving acts as she went her way. If this is not enough reason for 10 stars in this war-ravaged world where people are so hostile to each other, not realizing how differences are the spice of life, rather than a reason to kill ... so I do not I know what it is. This show was certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift meant to break a smile on our chops ... I heard from a doctor before everything I mentioned above leads to a " hart "healthy ... and is not that what we all need? :)
