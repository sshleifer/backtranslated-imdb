This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured after an attack. Once they are out of uniform, they are rightly treated as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The Japanese martial court, out of admiration for its heroism, authorizes the death of a warrior. Of course, under Bushido's code, that means they must be beheaded. A destination for which, as Westerners, they are not prepared.
