This could be the definitive noir film of all time if the Columbia studios had not cut the original of Orson Welles so much. What we have left is an imperfect and brilliant film that shows Welles's overwhelming talent as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> "The Lady of Shanghai" is film noir. It is more shocking and confusing. Welles, with an uneven accent, portrays Michael O'Hara, an Irish traveler who, after a fateful encounter with seductive and dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a great performance) finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewmember and the yacht of her crippled husband (Everett Sloane). Elsa, or "Rosalie," as Michael likes to call her, plays the innocent and defenseless doll very well, tying O'Hara into his web. While lovers lead a not-so-secret affair at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner at his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), comes on board. He is a strange and untrustworthy figure who offers Michael a unique proposition: he will receive $ 5,000 to help Grisby fake Grisby's death, so it looks like a murder. The plan is for Michael to give up a technical issue and run into the sun with Elsa. But things are not planned. <br /> <br /> Hayworth offers us one of the best femmes fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrait. Sometimes she seems genuinely vulnerable and childish, in others brutal, world weary and hard. She is always brilliantly beautiful, whether the situation calls for her to be wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black, brandishing a weapon. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is a long way from her famous "Gilda" role. Her then husband, Orson Welles, cut her trademark reddish hair for a dyed blonde crop (irritating Columbia boss Harry Cohn). It was a fantastic marketing move, and it changes according to your attitude changed wonderfully. She is not the nice femme fatale that 'Gilda' is, here - on the contrary, she is a predatory, black-hearted dora who views murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> Welles and Hayworth's pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in marriage. They would get divorced after the movie was made, so this is also a curiosity to provide some insight into the complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic, lovers into it, so it is difficult to assess whether or not they have a real chemistry on the screen. Certainly every encounter is potent and full of raw sexuality, with Welles as the "face of the fall" (he even admits himself in the movie!) And Rita as the baby that crosses. <br /> <br /> Welles's character is the typical noir 'drifter' with little sense. As Welles' voice proves, O'Hara does not really use his brain "expect to be thinking about her (Elsa)." Welles used to be smart and charismatic, so his turn here as stupid Michael is unusual and very interesting. In fact, Welles was a very talented actor and he did well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is adequately slimy as Hayworth's crippled husband. One wonders why he hires Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why does he invite a 'threat' on board? One interpretation could be that Michael provides "service" to his wife that Bannister can not in his crippled state. There is definitely something in this theory with many implications for Elsa's behavior before she knew her husband (she was a prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's innermost secrets being suggested in several scenes. <br /> This is a confusing, complicated film with a plotline that is basically flawed. We are more interested in the love triangle than in the murder plot, as in most noirs. Welles provides us with many of his usual cinematic touches, including the justifiably famous climax of the 'hall of mirrors'. It's a fantastic scene, an ending that can almost destroy the previous glitches in the movie and increase it in greatness. This fun house scene is visually stunning, with a touch of Dali in the painted scenarios (apparently, Orson painted them). The subtle visual images used throughout the film by Welles enhance the plot and make it a thought-provoking experience. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is scorching and confusing, conveyed superbly by Rita's alternately breathless voice and impotent, raucous. Little girl's voice. Hayworth proves her acting skills in this book and proves that she is the definitive femme fatale of 'noir'. It's a shame (just a lightweight, as Rita was a brilliant dancer) that she made so many delicious but fragile and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 1940s instead of noir of black dread like this. She was a brilliant actress when she had a chance to show off her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
