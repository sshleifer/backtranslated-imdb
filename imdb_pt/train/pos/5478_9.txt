It does not make sense to go over the story since enough reviewers did that. Here are some different inclinations of one of these "religious madmen," as one intolerant critic puts it so tolerantly. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers, perhaps, the classic example of how women can manipulate men with sex. There's a lot of truth in what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this movie: look cute, flick your eyelashes, offer your body for free ... and men will fall in love to help you with whatever you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, was the advance of work with the ultimate goal of money ..... a lot. At least four men in this movie provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many of the critics here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods of the world will not make a person feel satisfied. A sad comment that so many "critics" here would prefer to have immoral messages, preferring the sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess. Whichever way you look, the movie is fun from start to finish and Stanwyck has a few great lines, particularly at the beginning, when she talks about her rude father and his unruly bar customers. In just over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and ends before you know it.
