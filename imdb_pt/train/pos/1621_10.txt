Harman and Isings "Old Mill Pond" is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The consummate skill and art that characterize this work of duos is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon. It's a pity that so many people can only see an offense in something that is, and was always intended to be, a light piece of entertainment that in no way sought to blacken the blacks. If anything it is a tribute to the contagious humor and musicality of the black race. I have not been able to see this confection for many years as the 'race commissioners' in England found it very offensive to be shown in multi-racial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would love to see this masterpiece again. I think those who routinely look for messages and intentions that were never planned on these cartoons, who are, after all, sixty years old, should try to brighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that does not mean that someone has the right to censor what is visible from the past.
