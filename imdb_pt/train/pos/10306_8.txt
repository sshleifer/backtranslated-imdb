As someone who lives near Buffalo in New York, this movie scored points before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even a few small parts with real-life TV anchor people from Buffalo ... and for once, it does not hit the area. Hallelujah! Theology-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still made to look and think like humans ... and of course be a bit liberal. Being light comedy, it's nothing to win prizes, but it's still fun and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some ridiculously funny comedy scenes and, hopefully, the audience - from Christians to Atheists.- took something of this apart from a few laughs, like what prayer really should be. Congratulations to the writers at least for having this correct theology and giving a good message. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good-hearted movie that should offend quite a few.
