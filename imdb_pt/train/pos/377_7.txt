Genteel, Steven Spielberg's soft voice drama was his first real adventure in this genre. Moving away from his normal adventure / fantasy, he paved the way for his 1993 hit, "Schindler's List." <br /> <br /> Based on the Alice Walder Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, the story is about marriage arranged for a young girl. difficulty for a brutal and furious farmer and his painful separation from his beloved younger sister, Nettie. While the plot - over compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the failure of continuity and the tangled script of Menno Meyjes. "The color purple" is sometimes difficult to follow and on one or more occasions it tends to be somewhat irregular in relation to the time period. This lapse in scripting cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. It is a real pity that Maestro Spielberg has failed to identify and correct these problems, since most of the program is a wonderful example of his directorial prowess. <br /> <br /> Presentations are strong everywhere, with Whoopi Goldberg's debut - which she has never been reciprocated since in relation to performing performance - as the heartbroken Celie who just longs to be loved. Danny Glover lends solid support, though his "Moses" has been a top shift for him in "Places in the Heart." The featured exhibit comes from the unknown Oprah Winfrey as Miss. Sophia, the combative black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a white woman of condescending upper class. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer of Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote a beautifully melodic track and also provided some the occasion. Edit from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious landscapes of the South. This true case of the heart will surely bring a tear to the your eye, it is unfortunately, we get so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
