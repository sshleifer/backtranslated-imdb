Melodrama well elaborated, but basically melancholic, that, according to the interview that accompanied Isabelle Huppert, the scriptwriter and director Pialat impregnated a good deal of autobiographical details; Given the mostly unsympathetic characters involved, he makes no compliment - and he seems to have been a troublesome man, since Huppert also says that Pialat disappeared for days on end during filming! <br /> <br /> The acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite his young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status that, with varying degrees of success, is still valid today. /> <br /> I have 3 more Pialat movies on my stack "VHS To Watch", although all in French without English subtitles; due to this fact, but also to LOULOU's oppressive realism - despite its undeniable artistic merit - I can not say I'm in a hurry to see them now ...
