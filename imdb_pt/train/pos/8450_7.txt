It was not too bad for the first Raw PPV of 006. But the ending was really shocking for all those present and those who were watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST SET OF RICH VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL WWE CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad start, these two can take a big game seriously if they had more time to participate in a wrestling match. Flair wins for DQ after Edge hits his MITB suitcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH-TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE FEMALE CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad thing to note the fact that this is the first time these Divas have faced each other in the ring together. Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks & nails her own Chick Kick for the win to keep her title. 3/10 THIRD TRIPLE PARK H VS. GREAT SHOW Seriously good this game was, really. The entire HHH game focuses on the injured arm of Big Show, but Big Show still fights. Later, HHH is able to knock down Big Show & nails a Pedigree for the win. 5/10 ROOM MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus match} It was not so bad, that's fine. After Viscera fell, behind the referee, Benjamin's mother received a bag (which had bricks) and hit the viscera three times on the head. Viscera stood up just to be caught with a kick in the heel whirling by Benjamin for victory against the great man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH-JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREAT HELMS Flat, slow and sloppy. Both men did not make a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a fistfall to victory. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH PARTY-TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE AT THE FIRST DEPARTURE OF WOMEN'S SKETCH It was a lot of fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice by finally winning the first female Gauntlet fight. 5/10 SEVENTH GAME - JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT'S ANGLE WITH DAIVARI IN A CLEARANCE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a legal elimination chamber game. But nothing will beat the Elimination Chamber last year, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena and Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him. Seconds later Cena gets a roll-up on Carlito for the count of three to win the Elimination Chamber and retain his WWE title. But her night was not over yet. 7/10 After the game, Vince McMahon leaves and congratulates Cena on his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet, and says Edge wins at his chance at Money In The Bank to challenge Cena for the title. Edge leaves with Lita, hands the case to Vince and goes to the ring while Cena has another game to go here tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Scene that is eliminated during the game Chamber} is eliminated immediately by Edge, Edge, then crave a Spear in Cena, goes to the cover and to his shock Cena breaks. Edge releases another Spear & covers for the three shocking tales, as he won the Cena & won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year's, but it was still okay. The EC game was also good and the shocking receipt from Edge at their MITB opportunity is definitely the most shocking on the PPV show. <br /> <br /> General: I will give 7/10 & a C
