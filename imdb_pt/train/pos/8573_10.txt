In 1996, "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police (God Bless them) for trying to steal and kill 101 puppies - Dalmatians. All covered with mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "can". Now, 4 years later, she has, unfortunately, been released from prison. I say, that's about 28 years - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic movie and is here. dubbed "102 Dalmatians." In it, there is a Dalmatian 102 added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think; I should have known this since this was shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! In addition, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) escaped again, she wanted a bigger and better coat - done once again out of the puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song from the 70s or more. And now, we've heard a little of this in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a good movie that I keep asking myself - WHEN WILL THERE BE A "103 DALMACIOS"? ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
