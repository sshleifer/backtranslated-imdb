Poor geek Marty (Simon Scuddamore) gets horribly burned due to a cruel blow of the Day of the Lie that went awry. Let's move on for a decade and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to her horror fans in Maniac, Faceless and the Last Horror Film) in jest, are excited about the next 10-year high school reunion without knowing that a masked jester The killer is hiding in school (now closed) and out of revenge. <br /> <br /> Chaulk this to be a guilty pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the features of one. There's still just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I'm really willing to ignore the absolutely horrible ending (which, I have to say, I hate it) I think I like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool killings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager go topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for women): a free Simon Scuddamore kick at the beginning of the movie <br /> My Degree: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional trivia track; trailer for this movie; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
