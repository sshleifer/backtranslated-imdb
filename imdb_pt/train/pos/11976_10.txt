This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) His mother is killed by a drunk driver for his father Danny to invite his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about living life. Girls go through the problems of life and have life lessons. They develop passions, boyfriends and more. The whole show is basically to go with the flow. You do not have to hold a grudge, you just have to let it pass. I think this show is very good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and I still watch it today. I'm glad they still broadcast this show on TV. I watch almost every day. I rate it 10/10.
