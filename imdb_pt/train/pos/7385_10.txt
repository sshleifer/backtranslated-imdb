For all of you who think that 1.This was a dull broadcast 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscar <br /> SHUT THE F ** k UP !! This was one of the best awards at the Academy because 1. It was a time in history to have a black yes "black actress" win a Academy Award for Best Actress so many of our black sisters were ignored by the academy for many years. To be honest, I stopped attending the Academy Awards because of the lack of diversity in the winners or nominees. To me it was just a bunch of whites hitting each other on the back. The gym had many chances to vote for black actresses. who were brilliant in films, for example, Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Maria Jean Babtise but not 2.Halle berry deserved that Oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote on her for so long that the deserving actresses were ignored by the academy most of which is made up of white voters, yes, Nicole kidman sang very beautiful in muling rouge! but it was time for blacks were accommodated in these awards awards. As for Mr. Washington the academy owed him a lot of time after the unfair loss for MalcomX. For all of you who think that race is not a problem "probably white people" in the film industry, well, it's many of the most talented black actresses around or were reduced to typical stereo made by white people's roles than they think is a black woman or there is no "Angela basset". I do not expect many whites to understand any of this, because they never had to deal with any of it. Let's think they are the ones who inflicted it.
