I originally watched 8 simple rules on Disney Channel UK for the first series and got completely hooked. When they did not show more, they were annoyed, but abc 1 satred showing the 2nd grade. I do not think another series would start after I read John Ritter had died, however, the second series was not amazing the last series is back to its former excellent standard. I hope they continue to produce more shows soon, though I can watch each show a thousand times. Kaley Couco is my favorite character as Airhead Bridget and also presents incredible in Charmed. Rory is also good, he also shares my name and Grandpa. I keep watching until it's over until I hope it continues as funny as ever
