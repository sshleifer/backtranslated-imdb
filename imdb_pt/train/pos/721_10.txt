ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL occupies a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was very young during the peak of the band in the mid 70's to be well aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid 80's when I was about fifteen years old, and laughed all the way. (Is not it the dream of all high school kids to ruin their school and blow it up, all set for a rock soundtrack?) I recorded a subsequent showing of the movie a year or two later and continued to watch the sequences of the Ramones. once again, thinking "Dude, these guys kick ass! I have to check out some of your albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, a lot of LPs / cassettes / CDs of Ramones, and three shows of Ramones later, they are still one of my favorite bands of all time and the RNRHS still criticizes me every time I watch. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us, at least we have this movie and a lot of good music to remind them.
