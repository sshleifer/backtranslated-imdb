Every time I watch this movie, I get more impressed with the whole production. I came to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing. While James Stewart can always be relied on for a good performance, and the supportive cast are magnificent, it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was. His tragic personal life gives pungency to his interpreter qualities, where comedic acting skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch got the best and obviously did his best. Pay attention to the number of scenes that were taken in a take - breath.
