I've seen the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999 one night when I was surfing the canal before going to bed, and I really liked what I saw. Since then, I have been searching, scouring TV lists, scouring DVD / VHS shelves in stores, but I have not found a copy until recently, when I found out that some Internet stores sold it. So being a world-class procrastinator, I still have not asked. Finally, I found a DVD copy of a Circuit City while visiting Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. So it was only a month after I got home before I sat down and watched. <br /> <br /> So what do I think of the movie? It's good. Not as good as I remembered and waited for, but still worth the $ 9.99 worth. After seeing the entire movie for the first time, I rate it 7/10 with potential to become an 8/10. I'll have to stay with less sleep then, and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to get some dialogue.
