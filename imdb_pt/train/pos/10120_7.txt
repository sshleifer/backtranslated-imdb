The movie begins with something less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: Strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by cops. But when a policeman is killed, a Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he finds out that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get really fast. <br /> <br /> A previous work by Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society. is still filled with the usual old ultraviolet and sadistic sexual acts, although it is not one of his more eclectic or extravagant pieces. On the contrary, it is a well-crafted police fiction as Tatsuhito makes his way through the underground, a labyrinth that takes him to a gay triad leader who sells illegal organ organs from Taiwan and holds almost a boy brothel (one in particular the character who kills the cop at first). Tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with this society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use equally violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate this sordid realm. <br /> <br /> What is most interesting about this bit of work is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with his enemy, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, then returned to Japan and alienated by him. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, then killed his father and developed a crime ward in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearean character, which is strange enough, much less that you really begin to feel sorry for him at the moment when his last confrontation with Tatsuhito comes to be. And Tatsuhito himself is an equally tragic figure when he is forced to fight his inability to control his brother. While it is blatant to claim that Miike's films succeed mainly because of their shock value, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose track of how Miike can create bitter and disinterested characters. <br /> <br /> -PolarisDiB
