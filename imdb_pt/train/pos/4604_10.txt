This movie is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 .. for all the people who are out there who are rating this movie low notes because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, this is ridiculous, saying that a Jackie movie Chan is bad because of his plot is like saying that a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch Jackie Chan in fight scenes because the action is not so focused on a good story or something, if you look at how it makes movies and compare it to other American movies of that era and later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movies had about the main scenes of fights and not very good scenarios, while American movies had good plots but shit action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Porn is porn-assisted, Jackie Chan is watched by ACTION, I think you're classifying it as bad because there's no plot because you think an intelligent movie critic would rate a good movie, but the way I see it is a Good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Of course the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but I put that way the rest that is all action scenes and acrobatics pay a lot for all this. That changed the way American action movies were created, they even have scenes from the movie. If you want a real man, a true artist, then watch this movie and much more of Jackie Chan, he is pure in every way. It literally makes American movies seem like a walk in the park, and even in today's movies. American films depend so much on special effects and safety threads and stunts and more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true artist who has just done everything and is very talented at what he can do. A masterpiece
