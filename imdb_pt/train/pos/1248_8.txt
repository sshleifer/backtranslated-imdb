"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his mega-hit "Beverly Hills Cop." And even if it's not as good as "Cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a discoverer of lost children who have an unusual case. Your mission: find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom," as portions of this movie play as an adventure from Spielberg, sort of like an Indiana Jones comedy. Has comedy with laughter and adventure with special effects. Lot of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
