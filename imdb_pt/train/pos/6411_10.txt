This is one of the best military films ever made. And it's great because of its focus on values. It is a great human interest story that turns into a commitment to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro excel in the lead roles. It is wonderful to see Master Chief racism evolve toward respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, motivation, and sense of honor. The title indicates the source of your link. I never realized until the last time I watched how Carl Lumbly's brilliant portrait of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it is a cornerstone of the film in that it is the memory of Carl of his father that helps to take him through the hard times. <br /> <br /> I am selective about which movies I buy. This is one of those rare ones I want on my shelf. It will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
