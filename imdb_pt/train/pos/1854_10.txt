Having developed a critical eye for the cinema and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my symbolically safe breathing. While I am a brazen fan of Denzel Washington - both his skill as an actor and his public persona; I'm a fan honest enough to admit the (very few) times when he has not hit the mark in a movie or two. And I may be wrong about it - after all, I'm not an actor. But that was different - Denzel would put the experience of his career and guide a film on one of the most sensitive topics known to man - the abuse of a child. Like his directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to point out that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a movie full of promises that connected several audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief but true look at the life of a young man whose childhood was a hell but triumphed despite of everything. This movie did it - and only a dry eye of any color in the theater proved it. It is necessary that someone knows the topics of this film to know when the truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you have not tried it. And if he can attract even more audiences and get the audience to respond emotionally, without mercy, the filmmaker has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or dotted polka. That's what makes a good movie. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and, above all, Antwone Fisher - you actually won.
