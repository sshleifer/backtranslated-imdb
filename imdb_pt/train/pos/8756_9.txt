I caught this movie by accident on the cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see its entirety and I'm glad I did. I was immediately attracted to the plot and cared about the girls involved. High school graduates, best friends since childhood, take a high school trip and are taken by a swindler named Nick who puts them in serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring. Taken into custody, the girls learn to deal with incarceration while trying to find a way out of the problem. All they try to help themselves falls short when the Thai criminal justice system shows flaws and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the confidence of their American lawyer "Yankee Hank." Hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's native Thai wife smells a rat in the case and does some more research and finds that the girls really were victimized. The end of the film, when Alice does an altruistic act to save Darlene (Beckinsale) left me in tears. I really liked this movie and highly recommend it.
