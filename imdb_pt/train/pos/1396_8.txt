Probably one of the prime examples of following a dramatic suspense episode (in this case, the Terrific Equilibrium of Terror) with a lighter case, Shore Leave is the first real attempt on behalf of the Star Trek writers to produce a more fun sci -fi, and while the formula is not well yet in this entry (the real triumph is Trouble with Tribbles in Season 2), the laughter comes very fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow all the nonsense. Leaving the tradition of the series, Enterprise is not on any proper mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well-deserved break after three months of unremitting work. The Earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes until something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins to have visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people begin to experience similar things: a woman meets a character similar to Don Juan, Sulu has a meeting with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the form of almost love and the guy who used to catch it at the Academy. Throw in a spooky real tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what's going on before someone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea is classic: idyllic place ends up being far from heavenly. The humorous episode on the theme is quite successful, it was not for a dark turn of events that does not fit with the rest (of course, everything goes well again at the end) and the general unwillingness of the cast to show one more side funny of itself (most notably, and ironically, the other hilarious William Shatner). And yet, the Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example of writers who try new and unprecedented things: the definition of the success of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
