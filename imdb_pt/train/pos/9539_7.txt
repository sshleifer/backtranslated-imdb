For fans of Troma or the genre Cyberpunk mixed with a little blood spilled, then this movie for you! There is a good amount of blood spilled within the limits of this film, also the effects can be impressionable and impressive. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained to what we, as a public, expect from the movies these days. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy are the little aliens, which I found cute. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Also recommended are films like Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus for that weird approach to Japanese cinema, filled with marvelous darkness and bloodshed. Of course, watching this movie you should already have knowledge of both.
