This movie is really special. It's a very beautiful film. That starts with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and his friend Toshi, They are poor children living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, and then they could live, buy a house and their life seems become much better. They are making new friends, life friends. But something went wrong and they are becoming enemies and it all ends with them killing each other. <br /> <br /> I was negative about this movie at first, because when singers (Gackt - Solo, ex-singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer) trying to become actors, but this is not like the other singers who go actors -films. They are doing a great job, and no previous experience in movies (except for Lee-Hom, who has been in two movies before). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's a bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but - it was this movie that made me discover it. Well, Gackt (playing the main character - the orphan Sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play Sho's friend, the vampire Kei. At that time they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the film they became very good friends, and this also shows us that they really worked hard in this movie and that they had a good cooperation. <br /> <br /> The film has many different feelings throughout history. , Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After the people are dying, Kei is leaving and everything changes a lot. But it's still a great movie, it's the only movie that made me cry, it turned out so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen this movie yet, you should. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret. ^^
