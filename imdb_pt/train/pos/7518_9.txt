Beautifully done with a wonderful performance by Gretchen Moll, capturing such a simple and flat happiness in her work, and the re-creations of the small films and the photographs are done perfectly and often hilarious. According to Harron, they used film material that is no longer produced and 50's style studio lighting, even for outside locations, to give the color pieces their distinct appearance. Bettie Page saw the movie at the home of Hugh Heffner (she is now 83) with the producers there, but not the director, in case it got weird if she did not like it. She apparently liked even the official inquiry, which she found disturbing. Some great outfits too. The idea of ​​the film began in 1993, but it was worth the wait. Her portrait never seems to sound false in reference to all those pictures and snippets of (terrible) movies that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting piece with Goodnight and Goodluck, but a much nicer sight!
