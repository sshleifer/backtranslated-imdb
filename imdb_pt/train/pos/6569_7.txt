"Jake Speed" is a great movie with a wonderful message. It has its flaws, of course. Sometimes it's a bit slow. He introduces his villain too far into history. Its action is rhythmic to the rhythm of the heartbeat of a snail. It has a cast of grade Z (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has the good appearance of Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all that going against it, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to a charming script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the lead role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find this so inspiring? Because he says to me, "Hey, why not try to be a good person?" <br /> <br /> History is essentially a premise of "strange in a strange land," which is good and heroic. Jake Speed ​​is placed in the real world, where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a Boy Scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, cruel and evil world. That's why "Jake Speed" really needed to be a success. There's a great message that should have been sent to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really strived to portray good and decent people. I'm not saying we should be watching the Waltons in all cinemas on the cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" had a chance. ("Due South," a TV show about a Canadian mountaineer, is a good comparison of what can be done to liven up American entertainment.) Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons. , but the general message is that if you strive hard enough to be a good person, you will always overcome the forces of evil. 10/14/99
