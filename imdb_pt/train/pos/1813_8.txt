In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that made me think about their themes even after I finished. He talks about death, revenge and hell in such a way that it comes to you like a punch in your face, even suffering from the dream sequence in the middle of the movie. That's what makes this movie so good: Don Bluth's unique ability to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time. That, and the fact that you have so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy ending you have to say "I have something in my eyes" to hide the others you cried. All I said are just a few of the positives of this movie. As for the rest, you have to see them for yourself in an extremely honest movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
