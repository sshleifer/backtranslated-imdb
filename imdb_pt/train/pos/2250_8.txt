This is a wonderful film about the Mormons' struggle and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are especially powerful, and the message is one that we all have to remember - God does not speak, but communicate, if we just listen. As I write this amid the horrors that take place in New Orleans and surrounding Katrina, I was especially moved by the Mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after Joseph Smith was murdered. People came to this country to escape religious persecution and yet they failed. The Mormons' struggle to cross the country, the cost in lives, the difficulties they suffered was truly inspiring, demonstrating their tremendous strength. As far as the real Mormons' beliefs are concerned, this is not very necessary, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not a central part of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is first, though others have commented on knowing more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portraits were. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine and Jane Darwell all performed very well with the script they received. Although the film could easily have stood by itself (and certainly today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to take the crowds to the movie theaters to see a movie about the Mormons. Power is magnificently beautiful as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but remains with the family after his father is killed. The power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when he has a great scene, and Darnell (still a teenager in the shooting season) has even less, although they are a lovely couple. Their fate is unclear in relation to their conversion, and one wonders about polygamy in their case. You can not beat anyone for eye candy, though.
