Season 1 was incredible, the whole idea of ​​them adjusting to the island while the mysteries were being explored (and seen) was simply phenomenal; full of suspense, tons of cliffhangers and an incredible storyline. I mean, I love the idea of ​​just watching them get used to the island. And then, first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my eye. From then on, I got hooked. Season two was like Season 1, just a little bit better. I simply loved the idea of ​​hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of Season 2 were mysterious, chilling and exciting. I loved all the suspense surrounding the others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made the season incredible. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still, great. I loved to see the stories of others, to see their camp and to see the mysteries more explored. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not so good, was still breathtaking and fun but above all exciting! Now, season 4. I had hopes for this season, and the first couple of episodes is good, but then started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise the new "lifeguards," like Miles and Daniel. The plot became old after the first episodes ... and MORE OF ALL ... Season 4 was ripped out of something that made LOST a perfect series: The mystery, suspense, mixed comedy (Charlie missing) and the general excitement . Also, some of my favorite characters are gone.
