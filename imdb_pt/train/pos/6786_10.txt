Ronald Colman performs as electrifyingly as Tony John, a Broadway actor who can not separate his life off the stage of Shakespeare's Othello, the character he plays on stage. Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first takes place in the office of producer Max Lasker. Acting is a matter of talent for the practical Lasker. But Donlan, Tony's friend, disagrees, "No, no, when you do like Tony, it's a lot more." The way he has to become someone else every night ... so completely, no, do not tell me the whole system. is not affected by it. ".... The other scene occurs in the apartment of waitress Pat Kroll. Tony tells her that his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says, "Or Paul, Hamlet, Joe, and maybe Othello." When Tony starts rehearsing Othello, we learn that although he is trying to keep his real life separate from his theatrical life, "The part begins to leak into his life, and the battle begins. Reality against the imagination." He can not keep the two separate: in his mind, Pat is Desdemona and he is Othello, and he mistakenly believes she was unfaithful to him. He kills her ... Colman's brave performance in a complex and difficult role earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1947. Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. Milton Krasner's atmospheric cinematography should not be neglected.
