*** SPOILER ALERT **** Throughout Australia, summer turned into a flood of rain and hail the size of baseball that was wreaking havoc in coastal cities like Sydney. It is under such agitated conditions that tax lawyer David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, became involved in a case as a defense lawyer involving the death of a local Aboriginal who was found dead in front of a bar in Sydney. Having five Aboriginal companions arrested by Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, death is determined by the police coroner that Billy died of drowning not by violence, even if he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. However, the court decided to sue the five for his death, accusing them of manslaughter rather than murder. <br /> <br /> David defending the five gets no help from them in his defense with the defendants to stay well and keep what happened to Billy to himself and took what was coming from the court. One of the defendants Chris, David Gulpili, somehow begins to invade David's dreams as if to tell him what was really behind Billy's death. <br /> <br /> David at first does not take his dreams of Chris seriously. which is real when he meets you in court. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange black rock that David saw Chris have in his dreams. Later, finding Chris and what turns out to be an Aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula), who arrived at his house that night, David is informed that he, like Charlie, has spiritual powers inherited from his mother's grandfather. These powers will reveal to you the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent. Earth, Chris tells David, is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be taken away and the new world ready to take its place. David is confused about what Chris and Charlie are saying to him, but as the rains continue to rise and the ocean waves begin to rise, he feels that something terrible will happen. David wants to know if it's all aboriginal folklore or there are some scientific facts, or logic, behind the end of the world's revelations. <br /> <br /> So far, it's obvious that Chris and Charlie are members of an Aboriginal tribe. right in the heart of modern Sydney. That alone can get Chris, as well as his four friends, for Billy's murder. Since the Australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines, leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves. Still Chris refuses to admit that he is a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in Billy's death, with sentences to be handed down by the judge within days. <br /> <br /> David now determined to figure out what was the reason for Chris's silence, and why Billy had to die, is taken by Chris to the crime scene. It is there that David discovers that Billy betrayed the tribe members of Chris by going there with Billy not being a member of the Aboriginal tribe of Chris. It is also revealed to David that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the Australian Aborigines, as both Charlie and his stepfather Rev. Burton, David Parslow, were told. <br /> <br /> The stage is now ready for the great and final cycle of cleansing that David has seen in his nocturnal dreams and visions of the day. It comes in the form of a giant tidal wave rising from the Pacific Ocean to the Australian city of Sydney and then submerges the entire continent.
