I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantasy film in years. I do not think "action" is the right genre, although there are lots of action and scenes from KongFu. Wait, did I mention that this is an ORIENTAL fantasy? please keep in mind that you DO NOT use the hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who jumps around, I do not blame you, because you're still young and need to know more about "culture."
