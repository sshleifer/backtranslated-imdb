I remember watching this movie at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene where Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin, and the dead body breathing in it, was the scariest part of the movie to me, only heightened by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the movie in which the family name of the Blackwoods was changed from Blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known by his many hangings of several people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to have ended the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster first enters the gate of the graveyard, he is careful to perceive the sharp object of the gate, where he meets its end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
