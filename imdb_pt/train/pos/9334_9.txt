The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy that once starred in Bond girl Ursula Andress. Man was she hot in this movie .. She was stacked and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. I've never seen a nurse suit filled before. <br /> <br /> Ms. Andress stars as a nurse who is hired to care for a wealthy senior citizen. Even one in the house seems to be hitting his boots. One night, the nurse decides to take her grandchild's temperature and give some T.L.C. to your old client. The old man takes his nurse and that annoys the rest of the family. What kind of work has the family hired to do? The old man will fall in her car? How can she deal with the old octogenarian and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of SENSUAL NURSE !! Italian, but very dubbed in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
