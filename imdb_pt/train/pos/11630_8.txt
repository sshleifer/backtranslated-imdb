Red Eye is a good suspense to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some may not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 Min and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Do not worry, they take it very well with intelligent and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie seems to be a new basis for director Wes Craven. But he certainly adapted as much violence as possible to this thriller. <br /> <br /> The strong point of this film is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver dialogue and emotions. If they did not have these actors, the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy of Batman Begins and 28 days later. Completing this cast is Brian Cox of X-men 2. <br /> <br /> The pace in this movie was great. Only when you are thinking it will get boring will they throw a twist on you. Fortunately, this is not a long movie and neither does it seem. Much better than the other flight plan of the flying movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my comment on the Flight Plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not much worn. <br /> <br /> 8/10
