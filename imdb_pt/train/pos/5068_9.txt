This movie is a wonderful film based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in 1930 in Canada. I found it to be similarly fascinating and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. He takes late in the life of Gray Owl and follows it during its most tumultuous and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Canadian Indian hunter who finds himself promoting the suffering of the super-imprisoned Beaver. It also provides for the decline of natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> The cast of Pierce Brosnan looks rather strange, but it is not outrageous. Anyone who wants to discuss this point should first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan delivers a wonderful performance, just like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress, whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced peers in the recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good dramas, beautiful scenery or environmental causes. It is a film for families too, however, children under the age of 10 (depending on maturity) would have difficulty following the plot.
