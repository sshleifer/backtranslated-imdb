An intelligent script by the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and intelligent performances by the two male protagonists - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or at least the opposite) will result in an engaging and entertaining thriller. Above, the competent direction of the veteran JEAN HERMAN and a sparse but effective score of FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy to understand why this film has a timeless, strange quality. <br /> <br /> This is a Buddhist friend or a bonding story with two. lonely, disillusioned and exhausted, returning, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of the time (after World War II until the 1960s), France struggled to keep up appearances abroad. Losing Algiers was a blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they strive to do so after their discharge. One thing happens after another, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script: if it's there, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that these two men face each other physically and psychologically in a long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on one another. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different - the first, undoubtedly a handsome boy, and the last an ugly bad guy, contributes to chemistry. <br /> <br /> This quest makes a great story, which in turn makes a great movie. <br /> <br /> So as not to forget that there are women in this movie, and true to the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, though not as exaggerated; To say much more would be to spoil the pleasure of discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, THE FRIEND WAS RELEASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM; AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 ENHANCED; IN ENGLISH ONLY (not subtitles for the hearing impaired); TIME OF EXECUTION OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but the music of ROUBAIX has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
