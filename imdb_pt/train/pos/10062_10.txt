Wow. What a wonderful film. The script is almost perfect, it seems this is the only movie written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in it. <br /> <br /> The acting is sublime. Renewing Zhou as a Puppy was incredible - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very convincing as the tired old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only more films like this were made, whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong, a well-represented, well-written, well-directed, almost perfect, family jewel.
