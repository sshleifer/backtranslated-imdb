OK. This movie is pure pleasure. There's the ever-violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really begins to lose his mind and it's nice to see him do it. This movie is for certain people, though. Either you will love it completely or you will totally hate it. A good movie to rent and watch when you have nothing to do. Also Known As: Psico III
