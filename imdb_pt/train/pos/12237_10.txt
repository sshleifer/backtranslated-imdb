Mating Game is a charming and wonderful movie from a bygone era. Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie. My wife and I would see that. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watch at AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I loved it. We plan to order on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood ... time to dig up some of these types of old safe scripts, update them a bit (without spoiling the original movie and script like you did with other remakes) and make a call cast <br /> <br /> A remake would be a big hit on Silver Screen, DVD, and Cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
