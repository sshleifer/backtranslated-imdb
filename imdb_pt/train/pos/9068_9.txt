I thought the kids in the movie were great. I deal with children in this age group and found their behavior very convincing. We had problem with reference to private parts made by child of 5 years. I do not think the review was necessary and actually slightly diminished my opinion of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is on the rise and comes the star. I'd like to see more of him on the big screen. I liked his reactions to the situations he was in. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors did this throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think the message of bullying needs to be looked at more in movies with that age group. It's a big problem in today's schools. <br /> <br /> The ending was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts about whether or not he won the bet were very surprising. How he dealt with this situation was excellent. Often children today are not willing to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that commitment is an important part of life.
