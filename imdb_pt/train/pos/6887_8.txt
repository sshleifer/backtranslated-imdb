This is a unique and bold film. He is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performance. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask the public to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look in, ask questions and dig beneath the surface. By the nature of the film, it almost requires the viewer to look inside as well. It may take courage to do this. I can see how some people with a closed mind might find this quite disturbing. However, I found it intriguing, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original, visionary filmmaker. I am curious to see what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Watch it.
