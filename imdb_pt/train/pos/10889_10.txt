What's with all the negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that will brighten up any lonely person's day. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up vacationing alone, I wanted to cry. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. Also, although I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this movie made me smile and feel good inside. Before I finish, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell achieved a pure holiday success. Now in conclusion, I recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day for any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan you have not seen.
