Richard Dix decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place in the role of Ted Nichols, who meets a young Frenchwoman named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple only met for two days and they decided to marry a Justice of the Peace (Judge) and it is raining when they arrive at the Judge's house and they discover that he is not at home and will not return until the next day. As the couple is inside the house, you see someone lifting the hood of the car and taking a car part out of the engine. Once you see this event happening, you realize that this couple is about to have a big surprise and the story reveals a very mysterious event involving Alice Barkley and poor Ted Nichols begins with many problems and no marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Appreciate.
