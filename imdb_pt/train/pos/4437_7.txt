This police process is not worse than many others of your time and better than some. Obviously, he is following in the footsteps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but he comes up as a nice programmer. The best thing about this is the unadorned look it provides in a world that has long passed ... the lower class of New York from the late 1940s and early 1950s. Here it is in all its decadent glory, from the old tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels and the greasy spoons. These old police movies are like the travel accounts of a bygone and very bittersweet time for those who do not like today's disheveled, scrawny urban landscape. <br /> <br /> It is also intriguing to emphasize the scientific aspect of problem solving. the crime ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our top heroes, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the footwork, but without the tedious and meticulous efforts of the "lab boys," they get nowhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the cops here use the stubborn persistence of a C.S.I. The way some critics wrote about this movie, you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and acted for extras of his films. What a bosh! I liked John Miles as the gangly former Marine became police officer Tobin ... he had a carefree and laid back approach to the role which is a welcome change from the usual stone face histrionics of most of the cops of the period. Patricia Barry is cute and charming as her cheerful girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is muffled and amused as the eldest detective Corrigan. I quite liked the chemistry of these two and it did something a little different from the kind of "Dragnet" robotic approach. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not very deep and the final chase and shooting certainly will not rank among the classics of criminal cinema, but during its brief run-time, "The Tattooed Stranger" more than that interested me.
