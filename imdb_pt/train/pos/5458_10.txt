I really liked this movie. I thought the movie plot was realistic and relevant to any period of American history. There is always that woman who does what she needs to get into the class system. I feel that Lilly's character was portrayed correctly and could not have been done better. What I liked the most was when she realized what love really was. Throughout the movie, all the men who fell in love with her were in love with her, gave her everything, until they lost their careers for her. Until he met Cortland, he did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness. The way her life had ended was far from what she hoped was possible. I would recommend this movie to anyone from a mature audience, so you can understand the content and underlying meaning of the movie and the plot.
