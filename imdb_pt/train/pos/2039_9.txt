Firstly, I would like to point out that the people who criticized this film had some glaring mistakes. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly absurd. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with incredible cinematic effects. The actors are highly credible, teasing narrative thinking and horror and graphic content extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystique in this movie. Many questions arise as the audience is revealed to the strange and bizarre creature that creates habitats in the tunnels of black rats. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A fantastic movie with a great cold factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a movie that needs to be enjoyed along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Look forward to more of these great movies !!
