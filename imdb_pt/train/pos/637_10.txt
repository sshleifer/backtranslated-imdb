Okay, this show is nothing short of amazing! It has a great story and plot and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role! He's very big in Hollywood. He has a bright future ahead of him! This show lasts a long time because I really love this show, and I hope it has a lot of success! It's so interesting. I waited for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it finally arrived, and it's great! I also record. I can watch anytime now! Shame that its only once a week though. I wish it was at least twice a week, because now I wish it was Tuesday every day! I hope everyone likes this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
