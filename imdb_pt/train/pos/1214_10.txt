It all started with True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse to take the club to safety. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and takes them to see True Heart Bear. Later, the care gauge fell over and True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse check to see if Dark Heart, but they can not go unless the care club so they ask Dawn & John to take care of the club. After True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse Return, they send Dawn & John back to camp. Than the club and the cousins ​​have grown up to prepare to fight the Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart has kidnapped all the care and the children (Dawn & John) have to tell Christy that Dark Heart is evil. Than they work together to save the Affectionate Bears. Later, True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse discovered that Dark Heart's shadow and come back to take care of the earth to find out that they are gone. The Kids (Dawn, John, & Christy) come, but they were not powerful enough to stop the Dark Heart. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse come to help Dawn, John and Christy free the other cuddly bears, but Christy got in the way and was hit by Dark Heart magic. Than Dark Heart has seen Christy get run over and stop fighting with the Affectionate Teddy to help her, but he can not, because the Black Heart (himself) does not have the power to worry about saving Christy. Care and children help Dark Heart save Christy. Now Dark Heart beginning to care and became a real boy to fall in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy train at the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a great movement of all time and the best film of Affectionate Bears that I have seen. <br /> <br /> I like all the care has movies and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
