<br /> <br /> Arriving by car in New York City, the astute young woman with BABY FACE begins to walk methodically to the higher floors of power in a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-Code drama. Without a shred of decency or regret, she coldly manipulates the removal or destruction of men unfortunate enough to meet in her path. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has every opportunity here to show off her ample talents. <br /> <br /> Appearing very late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as a subject possibly capable of dealing with Stanwyck; her sophisticated acting style makes a nice counterpoint to her icy behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker portray a succession of their unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> John Wayne appears for only a few seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck's affections. This would be the only time these two artists would appear together onscreen. <br /> <br /> Film experts should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy client, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all unbilled. > <br /> The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuating the plot, is' Baby Face '(1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and' St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Handy. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is an excellent example of pre-code arrogance. In its frank and unrepentant treatment with sex, it is precisely the type of film that the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 intended to eliminate.
