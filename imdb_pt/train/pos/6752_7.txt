A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it up. The film directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story fades when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls in love with Andrews. He was doing very well coming in and out of a big hole, but it was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir movie. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, a crime boss Andrews is obsessed with overthrowing, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and energy, especially a scene in a bathroom with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the night meeting time outside the Bellevue Hospital, which sets what should have been the completion of the film. High marks for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the general picture of the underworld, although the angle of love and the bad police elements of the police officer do not help their cause.
