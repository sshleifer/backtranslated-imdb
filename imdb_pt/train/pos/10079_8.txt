I liked the cinematic re-creation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male artist wants to pass his art on to a young man, although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are wonderful to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their desire to be treated well. The operas of the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and complex. The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale from days when children were almost mobile. The plot is a little predictable and a little too sentimental for me, but it was worth the time to see the heroism, humanity and history portrayed.
