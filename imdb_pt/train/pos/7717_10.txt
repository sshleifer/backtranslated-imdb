I've loved this movie all my life. It's such a clever story too, with many classic allusions. for example. The ship that disappeared decades before was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology this was the man who killed Chimera, a legendary beast made up of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera itself and its monster Id. I like films in which writers clearly credit their audience with a modicum of intelligence, unlike the more modern blockbusters who spend US $ 150 million in special effects, but about $ 1.50 in a road map. Congratulations
