Farrah Fawcett spent most of his post-Angel career confusing us with an occasionally striking performance between his Playboy jokes and Letterman's escapades. But when it comes to this, there is no denying that this girl can act. Far from being a story of epic proportions, this well-made TV movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. Fawcett plays the remote black daughter of sheep who returns home and discovers that she has lost the last days of her mother's life, as well as the funeral, to the dismay of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister. Brad Johnson interprets love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of the telefilm drama - but then it is always necessary to confuse Farrah to watch, and it, in fact, remains eminently watchable. (And, yes, I'll admit, I had that Farrah poster on my way back when). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) in the Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
