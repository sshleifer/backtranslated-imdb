The plot of the intellect is as light as feathers. But the advantage here is the classic refusal between boy and girl that we get used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" now absent. Instead of the typical accidental knowledge, the pair of dancers are the old lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love since their days of dancing. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a musical from the 1930s, there are the problems of The misunderstood romance, elegant courtship, and the slight irritation of a hearing sabotaged with baking soda cost Ginger something special. And so, in the great tradition of lowering finances, there is nothing better for Hollywood's best artists than making a show. <br /> <br /> Delicious numbers of Irving Berlin are scattered throughout the show. Tops and evening dresses are stored until the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out again to enchant the world ... and enchant the Navy. Everyone and everything is once again so enjoyable. Pure classical nonsense at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we just know it has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
