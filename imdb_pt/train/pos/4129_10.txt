It's an Americanized cooking competition show. It will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I could care less about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity put on the dishes by the chef to the goofy president. Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You could criticize the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as judge ... But ... Meh. It's fun enough to watch and usually the winner deserves the award. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and I'm bitter John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
