Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is a profane league of triumphs and failures. The central concept is great, three prisoners with bizarre personalities are joined by a room (with whom the audience identifies) and they try to escape from their cells using a magic book they find inside the walls of the cell. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is well woven, reminds me of reading about the imprisonment of Edmond Dantes' at the Château d'If (before becoming the Count of Monte Cristo). The director has the feeling that the characters are linked to the cell, particularly the character with whom we must identify ourselves (Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but is suggested obliquely as a fraud). On one occasion, Carrère turns away from the cell to exercise and closes the cell door; we never left the cell, claustrophobia is uninterrupted. There are also no prison shots outside the jail, and the view through the bars is a long sunset over a generic prison wall. So although the film seems to be very modern, it has a sense of incarceration in the ancient world. <br /> <br /> The characters are intriguing. We have Marcus, a violent pre-operative transsexual who plays an abusive mother of Pâquerette (Daisy's Frenchman), a very retarded young man. Pquerquer likes to eat everything he thinks is beautiful, and unfortunately that included his little sister, hence his current situation (I like this comment about internalization, very primitive). Lasalle is an old man, withdrawn and possessed, who brutally kills his wife. <br /> <br /> The central message of the film is that your wishes will annihilate you, and there is a ritual that fits in with it. I think this is what disturbs me most, seeing people ritually destroying themselves. It has a real life ring for it. The rather simple soundtrack does it well, every step deeper in the quicksand is accompanied by the deafening touch of a gong. In fact, I'm listening to the gong every time I do something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think one of the problems of the plot is that the ends of the characters do not reinforce the message consistently, particularly with Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to change throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation as well. I also think some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than by execution, like the famous "eye of the vagina" and the sodal of the Lasalle, for me, totally empty images. <br /> At the end of the movie it seems that the director is in a hurry to end this, and some things do not seem logical, for example, we were led to believe in different things about Carrère's son. That does not change the fact that what we have here is that rare bird, a "pure" horror film. There is no comic dross or segueing genre, as Cube (1997 / Natali), the obvious movie to compare it, is a total immersion experience where you feel like you're in the cell with the characters. This last comment I make about it is a "pure" experience that I think is something that others have mentioned too, so that's a pretty unanimous point. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, my favorite part of the movie is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He vividly describes a scene in which he goes to work one day and sits in his usual place in the center of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to be singing to him that he will never contain his knowledge. That drives Lasalle to go crazy. This is really the problem of an obsession for understanding and knowledge. It's something I even felt. <br /> <br /> One final comment is that two of the comments well received in the forum confused the names of the characters. To be convinced that Lasalle is the oldest librarian, just click on Philippe Laudenbach's page and you will see that he was born in 1936.
