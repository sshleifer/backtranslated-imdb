Let's start this review on a positive note - I'm very glad they did not decide to captivate with Tony being shot and make a retrospective season as some people were rumored. In fact, the creator and writer of this episode David Chase did the opposite. We do not really know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma and his chances of recovery are very small. This episode seemed to move very slowly, and the coma-induced dream was that Tony was involved in a mistaken identity and Asian monks plundered from slapping his butt were absolutely strangers. After 45 minutes, I got a little sick from everyone in mourning, but that should not be a reason to end this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco gave a remarkable performance that defined her career in this episode, when the wife in conflict had to face the possible end of the husband. I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and vowed a revenge against Junior, which AJ probably will not have the guts to do. Silvio is now acting as boss, which opens up numerous doors to problems in later episodes. There have also been a lot of jokes in this episode, and I think Vito's 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore can find his death if he continues to be a greedy SOB. This was not a great episode and disappointed only because , although Tony kills people, we, as a public, love and feel that he is our hero of the show. This was a necessary episode for the series, although it was a small snore that led to the conclusion. Many compliments to the performance of Edie Falco, and David Chase and the writers for creating this totally original and unpredictable turnaround. This is the only season of 'The Sopranos', where I have no idea where she's going. I can not wait for next week's episode. My Rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best Line of the Episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Come on, Van Helsing!"
