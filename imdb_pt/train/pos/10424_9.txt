Since musicals have gone out of style and are incredibly expensive to do without all the talent needed to make a contract under contract for a studio, I doubt if we ever have a true story of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was in place it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio tried the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done this, I doubt that someday I'll be tempted again. <br /> <br /> And why should I. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been pleased with the way his singing was portrayed on the screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that freedoms were taken with your life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of great appetite, though with far more self-discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and had two out-of-wedlock children who are not in this movie. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the music industry is treated almost as a belated reflection. He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life. In fact, he began recording around the turn of the last century and along with Irish tenor John McCormack to RCA Victor made the music industry what it has become. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to virtually inherit a ticket to see any of them live. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a phonograph and a record or three of any of these men. That is why both have become the legends that they are. <br /> <br /> What the film has are some beautifully staged arias performed by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he could have become if he had the discipline of a Caruso to pierce the opera. Grande Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costumes and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the film with an album of songs from The Great Caruso of RCA Red Seal. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we could not have an album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna as well. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sung in the film, Lanza had a great hit recording of The Most Beautiful Night of the Year helping to popularize the Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, that's not it. If you are looking for a great artist singing at the peak of your career, you should not miss out on the Great Caruso.
