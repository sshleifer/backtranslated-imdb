What makes Midnight Cowboy a hit movie is the way Joe Buck becomes connected to Ratso Rizzo through a series of difficulties that affect them both. There really are not many glimpses of hope in this film for any character, but the harsh realities surrounding them give the film its own kind of optimism that these men can at least find humanity inside one another. <br /> /> This film features the best performance of Jon Voight and probably that of Dustin Hoffman as well. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, although it is completed by a good series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the beginning of the film. In addition, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice, Paul Morrissey, appears briefly during the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, it is essential. Check out.
