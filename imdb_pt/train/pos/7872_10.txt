The first review I saw of it said, "What does madhur bhandarkar finally mean?" Should he say something so decisive? <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing about it is that it does not take sides. No advertising. This is the film that captures so many angles of an issue (I do not know what I call "problem" here) and yet like any mediocre movie does not come up with a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario, just as it started. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters that they are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system that is even more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers ahead. Then watch page 3 if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
