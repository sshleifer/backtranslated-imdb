Incredibly intriguing and captivating, I found it impossible to turn away when I began to watch. I'm usually one of the harshest critics, but to me this movie was simply brilliant, oddly enough, I could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locals. <br /> <br /> From a film, I thought there was great use of light and texture. From the orange glow of summer light to the plastic sofa, everyone had a distinct air of realism to me. From a character's perspective, I thought that the notion of Victor Vargas was almost the glue that connects. the story was quite inspired, each of the other family members having a more complete background simply caused more intrigue in the main character itself. <br /> <br /> In addition, having met someone like Grandma and having been on the receiving end of such a situation, I can say that the situation seemed particularly realistic. The embarrassment, the accent, the cooking, and even the comments made seemed so authentic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started watching it without expectations and found it completely immersed. and brought back memories of teenage emotion, worth watching.
