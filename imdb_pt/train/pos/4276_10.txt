At first glance, who's singing there just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy? with only an unusual kind of movement, silent and slow: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in a desert landscape, then a bus and a wonderful group of actors, he hides a gem! <br /> <br /> Bent history and a false rhythm induce you to think, yes, it's comical, but it just lets you guess it will be a smooth kind of movie. <br /> <br /> In no way: very funny for a moment, dark and subtle, cynical in others, your development surprises you throughout history? Very ingeniously and intelligently presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them full life. <br /> <br /> And what is surprising, is based on deep observation, great mastery of camera work and has a great significance. and really everything, the general direction and how also the details are presented, it simply makes you forget it's a movie: it's like watching a kind of human society, you still do not know, shot by a friend behind a camera < <br /> And you're the only one behind it. It is simply and simply exceptional! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; in no way does this mean the script, the quality of the image, the musical score has an amateurish way, no, no! It's great Art! <br /> <br /> Why flow like a river ?? From the top of the mountain to the sea, with all the different types of foundations and pilgrimages that a true river will face in its journey to the sea ?? From a tiny thing to a mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image I used is the best way I can find to explain all the charm that has who is singing there. For me, once again, I take the hammer: simply exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the director is the only one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is quiet famous? But as I have not yet seen, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other critics have written down commentaries about the film, I totally agree! <br /> <br /> Eastern European cinema is not well known because rarely translated, but I am lucky to have this copy in the original language with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For fast, empty blast types and special effects, avoid it at any cost, it can be very subtle and good for you! But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I think you will not regret this, and in case you buy, he will have a good company in his personal DVD library, with not less than that. than they deserved great names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry between some of my preferred directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A movie is never really good unless the camera is an eye on the head of a poet Orson Welles ***
