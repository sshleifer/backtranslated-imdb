Reading a wide variety of criticisms over the past few days, I entered the theater prepared for a departure from Woody. Fortunately, I could not be more wrong. Sure enough, Woody the interpreter is slowing down a couple of rings, but Woody, the writer / director, is in good shape - and has found a reliable way to integrate his 70-year-old self into the story. Judging by laughter and laughter, the audience swallowed Allen's verses and dialogues in a way I had not seen in years. <br /> <br /> In a movie setting dominated by software-approved story arcs, twenty-something tastes, and assembly line formulas for children, it is a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen chasing his highly personal and yet rewarding way.
