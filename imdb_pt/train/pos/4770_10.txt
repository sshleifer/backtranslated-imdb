The only show I've watched since 90210! Why did they stop? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel part of everything! The least they should do is launch it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked out similar shows, but nothing came close. The cast had incredible chemistry and I look forward to each episode with great anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake in doing this show. If anyone has any information on where I can get a North Shore DVD please post a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
