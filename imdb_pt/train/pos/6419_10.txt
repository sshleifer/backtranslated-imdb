This movie is an excellent military film. It may not be a great Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that's not the case in this movie. Other reviewers found this movie too slow for your taste, but ?? like a retired soldier? I appreciate the pace that the film crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes allocated. The story itself has been told and recounted several times, but remains for a professional soldier? and an African American in that? to report the story presented by the film crew and to present the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's job to become a Navy diver, and his life as a Navy diver beyond his degree, is not the only story that is presented. There I also the story of how the Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday challenged his Commander's illegal order that 2nd Class Non-Officer Brashear did not pass his test dive, no matter how well he did, and paid the price of one loss of a Stripe. and a change of assignment. He also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bomb lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was in the line of line that would have broken him in two , if Brashear had not pushed him out of the way and taken the shot himself. This was a complex story worth telling, and I admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes of the DVD that the team tried so hard to tell a story. as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a grand history told so broadly and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and complete way.
