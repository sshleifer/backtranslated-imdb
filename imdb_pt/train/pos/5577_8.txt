I did not laugh that much about a movie in a long time. The rubbish that Hollywood has been putting lately drives me to a wall! This was definitely fresh and spirited. If you look at the demographic numbers of the rankings, only a few women voted! I do not want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave a bad note, why? Because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of their real value of humor and not because it is harmful to men ... it can easily be a "7" rated movie!
