This two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned. Certain pieces of the story have been drawn from previous films, but what TV shows do not do these days. What we have here was a good science fiction story. A great (really scary) monster trapped at the base of a deep pit, some superb aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens that the revived series invented, a set of basically sympathetic and credible human characters (complete with some security people "unnecessary" and nameless in true Star Trek fashion), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), and some first-class special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
