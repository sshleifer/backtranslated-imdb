I grew up watching Scooby and have been a fan forever. This drawing moves away from the same old routine that can be tedious for viewers. The Crooks in Mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that. Not to replace the Scooby gang, it's just a pause from the same crime scene for viewers and writers, I'm sure. The focus of the cartoon is on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherits a large sum of money and uses this money to thwart the plans of conquest of the world of a mad scientist and his henchmen. Minor tributes from the gang and the gang itself are presented from time to time. If you are a Scooby-Doo fan, you can still enjoy the bond between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come with it. Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so this is not the latest Scooby sketch.
