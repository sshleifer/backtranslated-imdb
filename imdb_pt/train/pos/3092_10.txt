You probably already know this, but 5 additional episodes that have never been aired can be seen on ABC.com. I've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show, ever. It's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and Omg, Steven Caseman - are all incredible and natural in these roles. Even the kids are great. Wonderful show. So sad that it's gone. Of course, I wonder why it was canceled. There's no way I'm going to let myself believe that Mrs. Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. It was the perfect time in this market. I watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope everyone goes out on DVD someday. Thanks for reading.
