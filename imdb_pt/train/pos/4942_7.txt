I have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie I was basically lost. There was a slightly amused mood, but at best a Barebonian plan and a general sense of lack of purpose that was about to make me think that I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying it. There was no blinding moment of accomplishment and no suddenly dramatic scene that gripped me. In fact, nothing very exciting happens throughout the movie. It was as if I suddenly realized that the film should be largely useless - and that, in its own lack of meaning, was its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a small project "to leverage his career. He will play as a grocery manager and spend the day at a neighborhood grocery store to research the paper. While there he meets and connects with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a box that wants more out of life. He helps her prepare for a job interview as if she were testing for a role while she introduces him to real life. It's really funny to see "him" (because that's how the character is identified in the credits) to be surprised by a visit to the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great together, with a strange, but completely believable type of chemistry combined, but father and daughter. If you feel lost in the beginning, take it. In the end, it turns out to be a delightfully charming film. 7/10
