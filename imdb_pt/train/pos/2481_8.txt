I admit that I only saw about three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and of course Hamlet) one I liked, the other I found more or less (Macbeth), and Hamlet I just found a play- cousin. I am pleased to tell you that this adaptation is as good as the intense and dramatic play. The acting is extremely strong (with a cast featuring Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you miss it?) And the change over time (looks like something between the 17 and 1800s) plays beautifully as the characters move . and tell their infamous lines straight out of the script that any fan of Shakespeare's play will get goosebumps. If you like this popular drama, I recommend you watch this powerful 1996 adaptation of Shakespeare's admirer Kenneth Branagh.
