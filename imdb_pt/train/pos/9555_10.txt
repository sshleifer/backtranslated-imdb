I've seen this movie for 12 years on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they were showing this movie as a feature film with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since. I was interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, like Lusty the Sailor. I believe Dale now does the narration of the Harry Potter books in Casette, but even so he's pretty funny. This is a fast comedy. Not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures must go through their movie collection and consider restoring and releasing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also humorous as Ramble the Sailor. This is an obscene comedy, the kind of film you can not see any more, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars out of ****
