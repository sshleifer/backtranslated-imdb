A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of repentance in terms of how it relates to paranoia. There's a lot going on to have a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. The scares are very subtle, not the scares that seem to populate the latest Asian horror films. The way the "scares" are created is similar to the disturbing moments of "The Uninvited" (also known as 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly of the same caliber. The film does a good job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It is not perfect, but it does what it is supposed to do. I would recommend checking if you have a chance.
