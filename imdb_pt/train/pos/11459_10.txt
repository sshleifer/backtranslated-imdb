On one level, this movie can bring out the child who wants to build sand castles and throw things in the air just to see him fall again. On a deeper level, however, it explores a deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I was deeply empathized with the artist when he said, "When I am not here alone (in time), I feel destitute." <br /> I consider Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. . I know his works mainly through his coffee table books and some art gallery installations. But seeing his work in motion, captured perfectly by Riedelsheimer's lens, was a revelation. Defrosting in time, Goldsworthy's creations come to life, spinning, flying, dissolving, crumbling, breaking. <br /> <br /> And that's precisely what it's all about: time. The process of creation and destruction. Emergency and disappearance. From leaving the Void and becoming the Universe, and back. There is a shamanic quality about it, bordering on madness. You have the feeling of seeing him at work, that his art is a vital force for him, that if he did not, he would go where and perish. <br /> <br /> To our good fortune, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the medium of photography. Otherwise, except for a few piles of stones and walls, they would only exist for one person.
