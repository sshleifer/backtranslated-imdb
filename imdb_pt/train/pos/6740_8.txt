The totally rounded character of the main role of this film, that of the cop torn apart by his past and on a road of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique in his time, 1950. Together with the astonishing music and the well-written plot, the film is an excellent example of film noir at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the anguish inside, Karl Malden stands out as his boss, who does not tolerate nonsense, but also has compassion for those under his command in the enclosure. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this kind of film only on his own. If there is any flaw, it would be with the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney, who seems strangely out of place with the hardened cop. His scenes in the cafe, however, are wonderful and true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the small part of his father, is perfect, just like Gary Merrill as the hood. Great lighting and ambience. The building where deadly actions happen with a lot of atmosphere, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
