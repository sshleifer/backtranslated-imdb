Another Woo Masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is the best wuxie movie I have ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except a few moments in Hollywood ...). John Woo - greatest director of the century. <br /> <br /> Maybe hi is not more intellectual than many Big Directors ... But he is the lyrical and spiritual idol of all people who think freely! <br /> <br /> Your movies like great poetry! Woo is a Sheakspeare movie! Woo is a Biron movie! Woo is a Mozart of Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> Violent IMHO in Woo's films is not a blood thirst for directors but an instrument of art. Film themes Woo is more humanistic than most of the new films.
