An old family story told to two girls by her grandfather is brought to life 16 years later, he predicted. <br /> <br /> People are being murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are running everywhere and naked bodies are being appreciated. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she's not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plan to steal an inheritance? The color is superb in this thriller by Emilio Miraglia, which only made another Giallo, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several pictures were cut. Someone calls the police and all of a sudden they try to save Kitty.
