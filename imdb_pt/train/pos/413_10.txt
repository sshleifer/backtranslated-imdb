Of course this film is not historically accurate, but it's great entertainment. Most of DeMille's images, especially the later epics, are slow and slow, but the action here moves in a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very few moments of silence. The action takes us from an indigenous invasion into a hut; one of the best parts of the film with excellent Jean Arthur while trying to appease the war-painted natives. This is followed by her and Cooper being taken to the field of war and being tortured. Later comes an extended battle with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous, but very fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
