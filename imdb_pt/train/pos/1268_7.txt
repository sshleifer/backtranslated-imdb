Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, The Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes everything up to create a good thriller from a movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former assistant district attorney, Kate Capshaw, and he is a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother, Ruby Dee, freezes Connery at a conference and persuades him to deal with his grandson's appeal. He's sitting on the death row for the murder of a young woman. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural county of Florida, he faces a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is as ruthless in his crime resolution as Orson Welles. was in touch with evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery receives the separate verdict with evidence that he has discovered, he is feeling very good about himself. At that point, the film takes a decisive decision from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that not everything is what it seems is to say the least. The cast evenly displays some good performances. Special mention should be made of Ed Harris, who plays a Hannibal Lecter as serial killer on the death row with Underwood. He will make his skin shiver and he begins to get Connery to rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises on which he is basing his convictions. Many confirmed liberals that I know have come out thinking very differently, once they have become victims of crimes. <br /> <br /> Of course the reverse is equally true. A law and a conservative order, if they ever get involved in the wrong side of the criminal justice system, want to ensure that all their rights are truly guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process. and an endless one in that for the whole society. I think if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.
