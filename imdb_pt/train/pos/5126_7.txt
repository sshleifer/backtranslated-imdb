For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen. He is a decent enough kid to leave his parents' homestead and attack the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him working in the petrochemical industry. By 1980 this was starting to grow and Texas was definitely a growing place in the US. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job at getting the public to care about his character, who when you get there is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger, who has the same background, but she has some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men. And when she hits him on Gilley's mechanical bull, in a man's game, that's for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, who is a former convict, is working at Gilley's and this movie was his featured role. He's a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he catches Travolta's goat at a glance and approaches Winger. Travolta, on the other hand, is occupied with a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, that is in the slum of Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was actually a gigantic commercial for the highest honky tonk in the world. Gilley's is no longer there in the suburban community of Pasadena, Texas, but the memories are still alive. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful track country / western songs that were featured in the film. I'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can think of why the Film Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. I especially liked Johnny Lee's Looking for Love, if it was specifically written for this movie, it's a shame it was not nominated for Best Song. <br /> I liked the character of Debra Winger better in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but faces Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to this still as an unknown woman who will someday be the first woman to ride the Professional Bull Riders.
