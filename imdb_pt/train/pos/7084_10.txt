I can not decide if this is one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller and it has an emotional core, but I still can not decide. I definitely enjoyed that. This is the first Terry Gilliam movie I've seen. My first impression? I was engaged to the end and it is not so complex (to be confusing). <br /> <br /> The film is set in the future. A man named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to get some information from the past (1996 to be specific). One virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get some information about him. Also involved is a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly. The love story is beautifully portrayed and you can really miss this love and yearning for a normal life. The loose ends are tied in a very interesting way in the end. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked about this movie is that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not prefer to give any social annoyance. comment, and instead focused on this guy and his yearning for a regular life. "You want to see the ocean, be with her" is especially a moving line in this film. He chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. So this is not exactly apocalyptic post-film, but instead can be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes ranging from time travel to murky realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 90's. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are very good. Bruce Willis surprised me here as he did not act the regular tough guy here, but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. His despair in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. I have to check out your other movies. The beautiful Madeleine Stowe is a pleasure to watch. Ever since I've seen this movie, I've become so obsessed with it. She gave a great performance to a woman who sympathizes with her patient and ultimately falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise, albeit with his interpretation of a madman named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar-nominated performance is quite surprising considering he does not have many critics who have nice words for him. <br /> <br /> The ending is pretty creepy and that's also another reason to watch the movie. Duration or complexity is not such a big problem, because this movie is fast enough and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and there is nothing that is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
