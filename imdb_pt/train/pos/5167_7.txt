I have to say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and wore a jacket. Then, when all the males arrived at the camp, it was discovered that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but it was not. Did I say where Bill Paxson is? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said she was 21 years old. It was to be a 20-year reunion of camp director (Alan Arkin) most memorable. Later that same girl was interacting and talking about her experiences at the camp. That did not make sense. She would be a year old. That said, the movie turned out to be very good. Kevin Pollak was the cool guy who was always being teased. One guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director who admits he grew out of touch with modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult campers were a success in life. None of them had great careers. That seemed like a very real life. The movie was compared to The Big Chill. In a way, it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So even if the beginning is not promising, the movie turned out to be very good.
