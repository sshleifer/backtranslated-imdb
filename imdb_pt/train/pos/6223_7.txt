From a modern sensibility, it is sometimes difficult to watch older movies. It's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially a man so shallow and inconstant. He is obviously a player (I would not trust him to stay true to her) who does not want to calm down, who just looks at attractive women idiots and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him, he only goes to her after he is (allegedly) rejected by another woman and finds out that Connie spent all her money by renovating a boat for him. I wanted her to face him, not pathetically behind him! His sudden conversion in a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> In addition to this subplot, I liked the movie. How can you not like sailors dancing with each other? (You can tell they were from San Francisco ...; D) The "rehearsal" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers purposely get in and out of the "right steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music", with the beautiful costumes and the set of art deco, was beautiful. And I really liked "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it a few times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a little weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were good, but the dance was worth watching the movie. I wish they could show some photos of San Francisco since the movie was supposedly set up. It is also strange to see such a lightweight naval film with the knowledge of what Hitler was already doing in that film. Time. I have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself in a land of invented fantasy.
