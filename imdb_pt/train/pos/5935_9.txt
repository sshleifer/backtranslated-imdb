After seeing the terrible, terrible and terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew I had to see it as soon as I knew it. <br /> <br /> Pressing the play to see the trailer, I thought it was another ghastly moment. than until now appeared to be another bad aspiring filmmaker trying to bring new depth to an existing character. But instead I was greeted with a big trailer for a movie that unfortunately does not exist, as I would love to see a ready movie, even if it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> THE WORLD'S FINEST for BATMAN: DEAD END and then some. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next short!
