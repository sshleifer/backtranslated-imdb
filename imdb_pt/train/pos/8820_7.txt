I watched the movie while recovering from major surgery. While I knew it was just a "B" movie, a Western space, I loved it. It may have missed the flash of high dollar productions that nevertheless detained my imagination and provided great escapism. Unfortunately our society has a lot available, discounting small attempts is very easy. In the same way that I can enjoy Shakespeare's school performance, I can enjoy many levels of achievement for art. I am a police officer and I found affinity with the retired LAPD. Dreams like his astonish me so that I am unable to respond at the time of the crisis to save the life of another person (or mine). while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth took the villain (predictably), I needed a little happy romance where good could succeed. My world is really very cynical.
