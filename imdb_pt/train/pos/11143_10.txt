I saw this as a naive young punk when it was first released. I had sniffed like a baby when I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw it again in 2007, I knew what to expect and the sobs were ready and ready when the necessary moment approached. Fortunately, this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I had not remembered from my youth - or perhaps I had not noticed because of it - was the technical brilliance of this film. The use of flashbacks that tell a lot of history without resorting to dialogue. The camera work that seemed to put the viewer along with the characters of the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera moves behind the woman and the child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself, and the characters - obscure, sad and brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn to such a human drama with people that most of us would probably reject. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. It must have been 70 when I saw it. I remember that when I left the theater, I was impelled to find the company of friends. All those years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a great movie.
