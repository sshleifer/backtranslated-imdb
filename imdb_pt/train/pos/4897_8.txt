This film attracts you from the beginning because it draws attention by recognizing, yes, that this story is opening with a cliché? a funeral. <br /> <br /> In other hands besides Judi's, I would not have given an 8, since this material has been repeated several times: the once famous grand gathering, please choose one, team, platoon army, theater group, singers, band. <br /> <br /> But this movie never goes down to cheap sentimentalization, and when you think it's going in the other direction. One case in point are the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi. <br /> <br /> The band members are an interesting group and also outclass the clichés. One is in prison, one has found religion, one is an alkie and one has plunged into dementia. But the joie de vivre rediscovered by Judi, inflamed by the interest of her granddaughter, takes us and makes us forget the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> The cast is a talent of talent, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzman Cleo Laine with his incredible high notes, a last performance of Joan Sims, brave Joan, a cute like a flirting button Ian Holm having a ball, and Olympia Dukakis as a divorcee who takes money and lives in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey. The final scene is the standard Hollywood food, the star's critical children turned into fun supporters, old lovers gathered, young people involved in veterans music. Life should be so simple. But I would go back to watching and I intend to do it with my own granddaughter. For in the right hands, sometimes, only one loves those old brazen cliches. 8 out of 10.
