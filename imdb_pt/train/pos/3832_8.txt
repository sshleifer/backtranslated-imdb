Late at night, on a deserted road in an empty bar, Martin Sheen tosses a thread to Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends accompanying a group of murderous cattle thieves who killed a few men and kidnapped Cassidy's girl. Writer / director Christopher Coppola May have endured the wrath of William Boyd's purists for daring to make a modern low-budget movie with his beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did it! No character should be so attached to an actor that no one else could touch him again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was good fun and an interesting update from the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Although guilty of some bad acting, this is very serious and unpretentious, making it difficult for me not to like. <br /> <br /> The whole production is a little strange, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are watching a story within a story makes strangeness and exaggeration more palatable.
