Since I first watched, "Stones" is a personal favorite and one of the few photos I could actually watch over and over again. The great screenplay portrays the lives of a group of women (all interconnected) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar got a convincing film in his directorial debut and is an effective director of actors. <br /> <br /> Not that all performances are great, though. Of all the women leaders, they range from the average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should be addressed to newcomer Monica Cervera, who convincingly interprets the retarded daughter of Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl's nurse, and there are small thanks from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Stones" is beautifully written and filmed, when I watched it I was so moved that I could not stop thinking about it for days. I recommend.
