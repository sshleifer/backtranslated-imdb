When I heard that this movie was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. This director of Taiwan broke into fame with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" a few years ago and then moved to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm." Now he turns his attention to another American icon - the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story is set in Missouri, a southern sympathetic state of the Union. These have never officially joined the Confederate Army. Instead, they formed outlaw bands called bushwhackers, had long hair and sometimes confiscated Union uniforms they wore over their ordinary clothes. <br /> <br /> The film portrays its moral dilemma, the great drama of the times and its supposedly heroic missions of killing slaughterers and farmers who have helped the Union. There are no stars in this film unless you consider "Jewel" the singer, well chosen as a young confederate widow as a star. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is cast as a young German who is derided for his inheritance because the Germans were supposed supporters of the Union. This young man is an excellent actor, full of young people facing his performance, which encompasses the his admiration and subtle accomplishments, as he is exposed to the horror of war. Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave traveling with bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. It gives a good and discreet performance. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors, however, are made of wood, especially in the lengthy conversations they have about morality. And your fantasies are too new. And the "southern gentleman" theme of manners and education and hat tip for women seems a little too much - especially since they make it a point to kill all the men they pull from their women's arms, then burn the stores. and houses. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think this is going to be one of Lee Ang's "great" movies, I found myself fascinated by it, despite the slow parts and its excessive length. of 140 minutes. I was interested in what was going on next, and I felt empathy for each of the characters they all saw as real and imperfect human beings trapped in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much as normal warfare. film, but still recommended - especially for fans of the Civil War. <br /> <br />
