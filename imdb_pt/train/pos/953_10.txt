Much richer in texture and personality than the classics of the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century. Scrooge's character, played by Mr. Scott, seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought a richer, more robust and even more moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the most mediocre man in eighteenth-century London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal, understandable, but highly conflicting level; his role was represented by the great authority that Scott always brought to the screen: his usual warlike voice was sometimes whispered, almost like a soliloquy, as he scolded the Christmas holiday in one breath and revealed his own human frailty. on your next line. He could portray Scrooge sour and crunchy, and a poorly understood Scrooge, all sympathetic in the same scene. <br /> <br /> Truly a remarkable performance by a giant of its generation.
