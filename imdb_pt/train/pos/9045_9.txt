There is a bit of curiosity that should be pointed out about a scene at the beginning of the movie in which Homer watches the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) that showed the attempt to launch Vangard, <br /> <br /> He is shown next reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun offering condolences about failure. Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville working for the Army. The Vanguard project was from the former NASA team, which was soon to be the Goddard Space flight center. The army attacked Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US-made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake may actually have been made by Homer, because of von Braun's notoriety, but his team did not have their attempt to fail. In fact, the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster, used for Shepard's orbital sub-flight as well as Grissom's. <br /> <br /> That's why this kind of movie is as good as it is expected to inspire people to read and identify these trivia and in the process see what was done and be inspired to do more .
