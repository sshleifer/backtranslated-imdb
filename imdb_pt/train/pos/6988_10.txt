This is a movie that will take time to get out of your head after you have seen it. The dialogues are almost perfect, which was to be expected, since it was adapted from one piece. The actors are simply giving their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure happiness! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is totally credible in her role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so dumb) giving both pleasure to the eyes and ears, Jean-Paul Rouve is providing an excellent approximation of the total idiot (and proud to be like that), and Marina Fois is the stupid friend who is always wrong when you least expect it. <br /> <br /> Thumbs for Bernard Rapp and associates to adapt this excellent game, and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more of these in today's production. If you like it, you may also like: "Un aire de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by the Bacri / Jaoui couple.
