This was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease in the family. Well-acted and well-directed. If there were flaws, I would have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again. And all people from all cultural backgrounds? I would love to see a movie where all these cultures are shown - just like in real life. However, the film has grown in terms of its values ​​and its understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to its creator. I loved the movie and it brought tears to my eyes.
