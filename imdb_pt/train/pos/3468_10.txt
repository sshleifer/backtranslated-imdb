I just loved this movie! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be very painful. I remember how difficult it was when John was shot. However, watching "Two of Us" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did an incredible job describing what "might have been". Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and faced the challenge head-on. I was struck by his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite convincing as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the roof scene - it was so poignant. The film left me with sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances.
