Producer Joel Schumacher, who also directed "Phone Booth," '02, and many other great movies have shown in detail how no one can really be trained to be a killing machine without destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has. to face when getting into COMBAT !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", '03, gave one of his best performances and really carried the whole image in the back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", '02, gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), 'All The Real Girls', '03, showed her true acting skills in the role she played. There were two brief scenes in which soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. A veteran Vietnam Army instructor told the soldiers how to actually torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places in a male human body. Nice and fun movie to watch.
