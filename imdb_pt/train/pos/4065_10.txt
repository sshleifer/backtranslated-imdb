I saw the original English version on the video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. I can not believe I'm saying this. The story is about a boy who knows a girl with a story that is intertwined with yours. The two are thrown into one of the most entertaining and intriguing stories of any animated film. The quality of the animation is excellent! If you have seen Disney's delivery work on Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality in your production. He almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba, the white lion. (but not exactly!) Finally the Miyazaki movies are being released correctly! I can not wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!
