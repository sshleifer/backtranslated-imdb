This movie has lots of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines on this. He exhibits his comic side and it was really weird to see him being beaten. Your training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought tying knot could be so deadly? Many acrobatics and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you'll have an incredible final showdown! Do not mess with Manchu bandits; They are relentless!
