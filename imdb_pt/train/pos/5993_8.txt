The Cure uses the voice to create an intense mood. Although the VO is responsible for all lines of the film, it does not take anything away from the visual story. The use of various film materials adds a lot of texture to the story. The choice of matching b & w and color worked very well to increase the jumps in time. The end will make you jump even though you can anticipate the outcome. I especially liked the thrill of the movie thriller. The close-ups to the love scene are also beautiful and reflect a tasteful look. The piece is very short, but it succeeds a lot. Rigorous editing really helps show what a short film can do. Worth seeing more than once!
