Yes, it was a bit of a low budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad things about this is that you can say that the budget of this movie does not compare to "Waterworld" and although the plot was good, the movie never hit its potential! Strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worth watching on a rainy night.
