I suggest free Boob references, so I'll write a review (no pun intended). I love Elvira, not in a "I-will-throw-it-just-to-impress-jodi-adoptive-fanatic" way, but suffice it to say that I think she rocks. The film is played as a horror movie from the 50's just more fun, look up the reference "Leasurely stroking of the ankle" to know what I mean. what relay shines in the film is the absolute charm of Elvira (or should be the cassandras). I saw this movie for the first time at the tender age of 8 years, and I have seen countless times since .. I really should start buying a copy, the videostore version is looking a little worse for wear. If any other fan of the film wants to send me an email, feel free. <br /> <br /> p. Another great performance of Edie McClurg (chastedy outcast) is an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
