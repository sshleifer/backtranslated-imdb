Some of the performances were a bit suspicious. I remember that disgusting Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yes, OK, he's now dead) made a speech about that movie saying it was a disgrace to portray NI Protestants as murderers. Now, for all Protestants at NI, this movie was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were legalists) and who traversed Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. My main regret about this movie is that it does not show any ray of light or hope, it's all doom and gloom, I mean, the little girl in the end has to die. Maybe this sounds corny, but it could have been the feel that not all Prods & Tiags are bad or totally good either.
