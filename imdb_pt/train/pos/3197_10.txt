If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, you should see this. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you should see this. If you are a fan of movies in general, you need to see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably have a lot of value, but the more work you've seen for Crispin or Sean, the better. This movie is so funny, but it's also pure genius. There's nothing I know that resembles this movie. It's your own genre. I doubt if something like that is done again. I can not say more about exactly why without undoing partially, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing this. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the reviewers here who gave a bad review, I ask you to watch the movie again. In fact, there is no point at which this movie can be called "boring." This is possibly the funniest, funniest, and least annoying movie of all time. And it only improves with age and repeated visualizations. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few could claim to have seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the incredible Rubin and Ed, who Crispin Glover also stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this movie are rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent searches, and there are a few ways to find it that I know of. But I really would like someone to put it on a DVD.
