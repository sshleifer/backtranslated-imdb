I just recently watched it on the Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers, illustrious in their own country, to make short films, eleven of them all in one film, focusing on only one subject: September 11. <br /> From wacthing this movie I could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an Iranian film in which a teacher struggles to teach students about what happened to Sept. 11, which they fail to realize until later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France involves a deaf woman who writes a letter to her angry lover while she does not know what is happening like TV. The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking to a dead soldier about recent events not just about 9/11 terrorists but about explosions elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Next comes Bolivia, where a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes that they should march for them. <br /> <br /> The next in a country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man they believe to be Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The next comes from Mexico, in which nothing is shown except the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> The next Israeli involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report, but is often informed about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can not remember at the moment, but they are all powerful. It will bring back your emotions of that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
