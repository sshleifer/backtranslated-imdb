Well, I'd consider Police Story to be one of Jackie Chan's best movies. The plot, the fight scenes and stunt work are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the master of the crime was released because of lack of evidence, he set Chan up for the murder of a police officer. Because of this, he became sought after by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime chief, went to a shopping mall and began stealing evidence of the crime lordship's crime from her computer and was preparing to pass them on to Chan. However, the lord of the crime knew that Salina had downloaded her incriminating data and hired her henchmen to capture her. Later, Chan appeared in the scenes and began to fight all the henchmen, defeating them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen punching the lord of the crime. Finally, this is the best action and comedy film. Everyone should watch. Highly recommended.
