The movie was very sweet and moving! I cry almost every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie to each one. The film was very inspiring to me. The actors did a great job, and the film was very well played and done. The movie was about a girl who owned a parrot whom she called Paulie. Paulie had separated from her because of her parents because they thought it would be best for her. <br /> <br /> After Paulie had tried so many people, he ended up in a cage alone in a basement. Finally, this Russian man who got a job as janitor. He had met Paulie in the basement and Paulie began to talk to him telling the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie to meet with Marie (the little girl who created Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
