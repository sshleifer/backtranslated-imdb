I saw this movie when I was about 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and I never forgot that movie! I was deeply touched and touched by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe it when he turned into an eagle when everyone at the movies thought he was going to die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered how we saw it yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget - just like my sister and I ...
