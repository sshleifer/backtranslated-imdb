This series was just like what you would expect from Mr. Spielberg. It's really one of those scary, funny and kid shows you will not forget. Like Outer Limits (another great show), this little series does what it can not. It was great and deserved to run more. It was a great show even the kids could watch, although some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted to be, but they all always had a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you did not want to end, or those you have made. I remember watching some of them on Sci-Fi when I was 10 and even now, I still like to see them when I can. Truly a fun and imaginative show. I loved it and still love it.
