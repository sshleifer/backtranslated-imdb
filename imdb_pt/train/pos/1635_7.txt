In my high school days in Salina, Kansas, they filmed something called "The Brave Young Men of Weinberg" locally, and the film crews were prominent for weeks. eventually we learned that the movie was "Up The Academy", and it was a little humm, "low brow" than we were led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it since I was there, and the local crowd seemed less than pleased with the exhibit. I was seventeen, and I thought it was a rather na√Øve attempt at some kind of comedy "Animal house," right down to the fart jokes. <br /> <br /> I've watched it many times since, and my opinion softened a bit. it's dumb, but sometimes it takes some of the "crazy" magazine humor, at least as well as most "Mad TV". Ron Liebman may hate you, but he's almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on Santa Fe Avenue where I had parked my car while I was buying some guitar strings. Too bad that the brief appearance of my Pinto usually seems to be cut to the TV. I did not see the new DVD, but if my old dick is visible, they will have a sale.
