I must say I thought I saw everything. I'm a fan of extremely tired movies. This movie did not shock me by any means. I'm way beyond that point. But that led me to certain emotional places that I did not know I could go. I had no idea I could find (ick) the idea of ​​erotic bestiality. Never never never. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did that. I have to give credit to the director. He pulled it out. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes, this movie has a TOTAL hole. We started with some very explicit scenes of two horses having sex. After five minutes of that, I started to wonder if buying this movie would not be a mistake. Then an old man in a wheelchair talks to another old guy about two people getting married. Then some nervous guy shaves. So we see (briefly) a hot catch with a butler (but that's very brief). Right now I was cursing the movie aloud while trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep around the 40-minute mark and forced myself to finish the next night. <br /> <br /> Finally we get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is, or who she is in this movie) has a dream about a Victorian girl being devastated by a beast-thing in the woods. The scene continues for some time and is really the meat (heh-heh) of any business. It is beautifully filmed, superbly edited and delivers the goods. They try to finalize the plot at the end and this makes sense, but neither does it. Oh well. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to film myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes they rescued him.
