The sexploitation era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the grant of free nudity in the major movies and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. Her peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of the time was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult following. She was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the main roles of these films, and her subsequent credits proved it. And her apparent deliberate fall into obscurity when her career was taking off only increases her mystique. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably very talented for the sexploitation genre, and her ability, combined with Monica Gayle's onscreen presence, makes Sandra the Making of a Woman a pleasantly pleasant experience. The movie never drags and you will not have your finger pressed on the fast forward button.
