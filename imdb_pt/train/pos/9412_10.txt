When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a girlfriend to see her the second time. I do not think she was as impressed as I was! This film was comical but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were fairly new. The lessons from this film can be applied to issues related to today's GM experimentation.
