This was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable did together and they would do several more. Crawford stars as a wealthy young woman whose father is exterminated in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before, and their brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but he gets very fast. Crawford becomes a newspaper reporter, but wants to work on the big stories, but gets useless things to work on. His is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a good movie, but not one of the best.
