The first time we watch this movie, it's hard to know exactly what happened, but in a subsequent view, it gets clearer. I liked this movie. Dean Cain was excellent as Bob. The character of Lexa Doig was confused to understand, at first she was out to arrest Bob, but I truly believe she managed to love him, although until then she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was a usual excellent. It gets better with every movie he does. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla, and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide
