I just came back from a pre-release preview of this great science fiction movie. His style is definitely unique and very well done. It's shot with real actors but turned into a black and white comic style that you've never seen before. He goes one step beyond the City of Sin and does it well. It is a successful combination of French comics and cinematographic cultures. History and humor remind you of Blade Runner, and if you liked it, you'll certainly like it, too. The plot is clever, never boring and has some minor twists. This movie is a must-see for any movie buff, except, perhaps, those who absolutely do not like science fiction or b & w.
