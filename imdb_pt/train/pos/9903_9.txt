Wow, I commend IMDb and Google as I've been trying to remember the name of this incredible movie for over 15 years. Slaughter High, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with a plot summary, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what is happening. That's why you're here anyway. What I'm going to do, however, is to explain the memory I have of the quintessence of the D-Movie of the 80s. In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my father used to rent all. these horror movies. Would he care if his children watched with him? No. Then at that tender age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in this movie was with me great moment. I have not seen it since, but I still remember most of the ridiculous deaths in the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) It is electrocuted. Or the guy being drowned in a pool. Let's go! My personal favorite, though ... the stomach exploding from the contaminated beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate in a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like 10 or 15 years later, and you think it would be a good idea to drink? So your stomach explodes? What!? And this big line: Let's get my car ... always starts. Classic crap all the way. <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back now, almost 20 years later, and laugh at it. But when I was 7, I was scared. That jester's hat (or was it a mask?) That the killer rocked scared me! <br /> <br /> In all, yes, a fucking movie. But for nostalgic purposes and for the mood factor this movie gets 9 out of 10 from me. Stay up late every night and expect to see the same Late Late Video show, or look for a VHS copy and dust off your VCR.
