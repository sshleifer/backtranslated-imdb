This movie will stay down in history as one of the big names, alongside Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo, such as have never been seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil emanating from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you shivers. Dingman's character as the goofy goat goes back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. My God, the climax. I will not ruin everything for you, but it makes the Death Star blast pale in comparison. If you can trace this hard-to-find jewelry, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it right away. I'm still waiting for a special edition DVD one of these days.
