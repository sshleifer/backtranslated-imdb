There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not very important, since what happened to who and when is still in dispute. The most glaring freedom from the facts I think is when they start playing in Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller, when in fact they played Indra and moved to the Kaiserkeller later. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the movie was biased in favor of Pete Best's version, but if he is the history consultant, then I think he gives the cards. I also agree with Semprinni that Pete Best's recordings touch the last word on why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not as lavish production as the later film Backbeat, I prefer this film because it is more accurate, and because it has a better script with a deeper characterization. There's a lot in the movie that's pretty substantial - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he's been "weird", only to find out that the band knew he was gay all the time. Little touches like the band going to a cafe and asking for "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene, which has some bassis in fact, is where in an audition Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass but can not play it, so he turns his back on the impresario and tries to fake it, but he gets caught. This is rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
