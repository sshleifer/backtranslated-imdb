Much has already been said about this film and I would like to join everyone who praised it. It is a very original film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster movies without making a mess. At times, you just laugh out loud at other points you feel about the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. The genius of Sabu can be shown in relation to some sequences of the film. One is where all three men who pursue each other have an erotic dream about a young woman who has just passed the street. This sequence is very well done and illustrates very well the characters of the three runners. It's erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of the genius of Sabu is the part of the movie in which the runners get tired. First one of them, the typical loser among the three boys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else is back and you see them dancing with each other and the next shot he dances with himself that is moving deep. All runners get to the point where they think they have something back that they have lost or are on the right track again. And in a part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing. So here is all the beauty and absurdity of what we call life that Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (they end?), But he does not steal his dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" who do justice to Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go watch them! <br /> <br />
