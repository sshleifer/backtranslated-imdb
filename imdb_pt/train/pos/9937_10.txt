This TV series was one I loved as a kid. Even though I now see through the pink glasses of nostalgia, I can still say that it was a quality show, very educational, but still funny. I did not see the original version in French, only the Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, a long time ago to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show how the body works. I swear, the school has not yet taught me half of what I know of this show. It also binds in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy foods and do not exercise with good examples inside the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade you? : D The drawing looked beautiful, very child friendly, of course, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, looking very cute as you would expect in the animated body. <br /> <br /> The series on history (especially the environmentally scary ending) were key parts of my childhood. I'm so happy that I found you here.
