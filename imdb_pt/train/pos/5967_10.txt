Sammi, Curr, a god of rock metal, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, they tried to censor his music !! (Much like real life Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osbourne) Killed in a fire, Sammi Cure was to play on Halloween at his old school for a dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how sammi, and what he felt (or he?) Nuke, the dJ on local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives the only copy of the latest album of Sammi, Eddie. . But when Eddie tries to touch the back drive forward, he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead, and telling you what to do to get back to the bullies of his school who hate him and his music .. Everything works until that, Sammi starts to kill !! A great movie and should be seen by heavy metal hairband fans with a great soundtrack of Fastway, and if you do not know how the songs sound or know Fastway and do not like them, they have changed a little voice and no style also to sound like the best known Cinderella, or Ratt .. Is the movie a true horror movie? Well, it depends on what you call a horror movie, for me, a real horror movie is a slasher, with much slaughter, or just plain scary. This movie is not enough deaths but it can not be called action, comedy, drama, thriller or thriller, so that's why I think it has to be a horror .. So if you want to 'Rock N' Roll, Rockin 'in the middle of the night steel your soul !! " What Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
