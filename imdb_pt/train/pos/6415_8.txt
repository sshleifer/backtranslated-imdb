The Timman Jr. drama about the first African American Navy Master Diver, who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict and bitter trainer. The script is not bad, a bit extreme at times, but the direction and acting are first rate, and this film is inspiring and achieves what is expected. I liked DeNiro in the lead, although not on par with his magisterial jobs (taxi driver, godfather and everyone else) is as good as his other good performances, as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his best performances. Rating: 6.6, rating: 9/10
