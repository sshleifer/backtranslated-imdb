The best way for me to describe Europe, which is at the top of my list of favorite films, is the exclamation that came from a comrade after the film ended: "I did not know what movies could be made that way." Totally original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what the cinema can be. It is as far from "master and cover" style as possible; integrate perfectly many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc ... all the same, none predominant. Despite the short-sightedness of Hollywood's "dialogue," cinema is not about dialogue, about beautiful lights, action or music. It works best when all elements are equal, where ONLY the BLENDING of these elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of an element, and the movie has no meaning. "Europe" is what cinema should strive to be.
