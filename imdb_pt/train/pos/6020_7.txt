A beautiful new print of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a thorough evaluation of the film. Let's hope the new print means a DVD with some insightful extras will be released in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when he left and I thought it was a big problem. This time I was totally impressed and would rate this as a "almost lost" masterpiece. The first part of the movie is a time capsule from the late 60's in Los Angeles, where I lived there, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place. Congrats to the production designer Dean Tavoularis, who found some amazing locations and did a great job. <br /> <br /> The print I saw runs 1 hour and 50 minutes. It is prohibited for minors of 16 years (or 18 years, I do not remember). I suspect there is a bit of material restored in this print. SPOILER - I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What looks like today seems rather tame by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour in the movie. Before we hear strange noises such as radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni was too bold to do that. I remember how much it was made back then to the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Much of the filming of student riots sounds like filming. A shot is in a different format and distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are real scenes, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of Frechette's flying scenes on the plane. It looks like it actually made some of the flights - there is no blue or double screen in some photos. <br /> <br /> I hope to see the movie again for the second time. Highly recommended to all Antonioni fans.
