This is one of the first "Pilot" movies for the Canadian hit Trailer Park Boys. He was tapped for executives on some networks before Showcase decided to sign them for a TV series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy movies. The plot of the movie is that these two little criminals go about "exterminating" pets for money. If you have a dog next door that's barking all night, those are the guys you're going to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to face and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I recommend! <br /> <br /> Classified as R for swearing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's also not very offensive (they do not show dead animals).
