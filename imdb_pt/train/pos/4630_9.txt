This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. Fantastic actor Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, has a minor role in this film as well. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis living together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There's a kind of Friends / Sex thing in the City happening (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so they can continue their lives in peace. <br /> <br /> But, this is the massage. No matter how many posters you have or how many raves of peace you have, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring both sides to the table, but they just want to keep it for any reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both here and here in the USA, who just want everything and do not consider peace. There are many on the Palestinian side who would apparently be unemployed if peace were to come. It is not in the interest of anyone to end this war, and children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always on your mind while watching this funny and engaging movie. Does not go away. You know something tragic will happen and of course it happens. With the feelings of both sides being strong and revenge as motivating, tragedy always happens, and that's what makes it an adult version of Friends / Sex in the City. There is no superficiality. It's real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.
