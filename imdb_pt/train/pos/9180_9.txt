I felt a duty to watch the 1983 Jane Eyre adaptation of Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke because I had just written an article about the 2006 BBC "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I approached this by watching it the way I approached doing homework. <br /> <br /> I was angry at first. The lighting in this version is bad. All / everything is washed in a bright white light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is badly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. <br /> <br /> And the makeup of the pancake is very heavy. <br /> <br /> And the ensembles do not totally convey Gothic humor. of romance. They are very demanding, too Martha Stewart. I just can not see the Rochester of Bronte following these domestic arrangements of Martha Stewart. The Rochester of Orson Welles lived in a cave-like darkness, well suited to the gothic humor of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all those objections ... is not only that the best "Jane Eyre" I've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite its technical flaws, brought back the feeling of reading "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> Critics of this production say it is very close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and did not need it to be less "wordy" or less "Christian" or more sexualized, the fidelity of this version to the novel that Bronte actually wrote is his best resource. <BR> Bronte wrote a good book. There is a reason that lasted more than 150 years, while other more subtle, more sensual and easy texts have disappeared. As a long time fan of Jane Eyre, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester, notoriously, is not handsome; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing more than being incredibly handsome. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives a hypnotizing performance like Rochester. It just astounded me. I have never seen anything like his total devotion to Rochester's role, text, dialogue and love for Jane. Dalton brings the page of Rochester to shake the life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is supposed to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles was also scared, for example, when he shouts "Enough!" after Fontaine plays a small piece of piano. But Dalton is scary more than once here. You really can not tell if he's going to hurt Jane, or yourself, in your desperation. <br /> <br /> Rochester's imperiousness, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys everything, sometimes in seconds. It's impressive. <br /> <br /> And here's the key thing - the actor who is presenting Rochester has to say that he spent more than a decade of his life in total despair, lonely, living with an ugly and life-destroying secret. <br /> <br /> No other actor I've seen try this part conveys that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. The current fan favorite, Toby Stephens, does not even try. Dalton knocks at the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton introducing Rochester to a singles bar, I'd say, "That guy's a problem. Do not even look at him." He is radioactive with agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not just the best Jane I've ever seen, she's one of the very few Janes the producers were willing to pitch when the book launched Jane. No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only in the 2006 version, Bronte did not * describe a sturdy and sculptural Jane with finely arched eyebrows and fleshy lips. Instead, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, in fact, poor, simple, obscure and small, and NOT beautiful. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, eyes closed and a little nose. She is really "small". She is not a fashion model. And she's the best Jane, the truest one for the book. <br /> <br /> Some have described it as cold or boring. No, she is faithful to the book. Jane de Bronte is not a redheaded mom, she's a private and protected teenager whose inner passion only shows up at key moments, as Zelah does here. Jane's book is someone that you have to watch slowly, with care, patience, observance, if you really want to probe their depths. You have to watch Zelah, here, to know who she really is. <br /> <br /> I wish I had seen more fire in Zelah in a key scene, but this is a five-hour scene in which she is otherwise very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its closeness to the text, this version, like all other versions I have seen, avoids fully explaining openly Christian themes in "Jane Eyre" Christianity is not incidental subtext in "Jane Eyre" , is central. Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, giving her a subversive and countercultural way of reading and living, seemingly condemned, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian god, who convinces Jane, poor, simple and obscure, of her equivalent value, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key proposal of marriage. This is not entirely clear here. In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent novel, complex and rich, and this adaptation of it, of all that I have seen, mines and honors. the novel is the best of any adaptation I've ever seen, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not fully honor the book, end up being a difficult task to watch in many places. If you do not care what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture based on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something that people go through quickly to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote-about Jane's experiences in Lowood and her relationship with St. John-are part of what makes Jane's relationship with Rochester . as explosive and unforgettable as it is.
