What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and siren worship services? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in a weird little movie. <br /> Genie is a cute young woman who visits her nerdy archeology father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie gets caught up with a mysterious prostitute (and blatant lesbian) who serves the next daddy. Dad is sent back to the place, where he discovers a tomb with what looks like a mermaid. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with a handsome Egyptian (providing the hottest scenes in the film). Eventually, Genie discovers that she must be a sacrifice and the long, bloody climax begins. Wrapped around this story is footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison, talking to a picture of what Genie looks like. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is fantastic as the Marquis and his descendant. His acting skills have always been battered by his makeup requirements, so he can shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue," if you have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including the young Genie, is handsome and average. The script, however, is problematic. You will quickly learn that the scenes of the Marquis are completely unnecessary, except perhaps the filmmakers had access to the legal scene. The cult of the mermaid that eventually saves Genie makes no sense at all. Who is the mermaid is never explained, and its connection with Christianity (which is sensationalist throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very unchristian, since the archaeologist is a father who springs from the Bible, but likes to be tied by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably did not have a clue what the writers were trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> So, why am I recommending this movie? This is weird. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies, the Egyptian rides a horse completely naked. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This movie is full of them. This is like Roger Corman on a larger budget. Knowing Hooper somehow came up with "Crocodile" after that is quite sad. "Night Terrors" is not perfect, but definitely deserves a malicious and bland look. <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for physical violence, sexual violence, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
