Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and all the other "Men of Honor" actors and actresses combined to make this a great movie. Mark Isham wrote the filmcore, so you know the song is really good too. <br /> <br /> But: After noticing a lot of jokes, breaches and very dramatic ropes from the beginning, I had to make a vow to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do that, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a real hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Look at him on the internet ... The whole story is more incredible than the movie, as the director admitted in his comments. There were only three African American divers from the US Navy in World War II. However, none have reached the status of US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African-American diver in the US Navy. And he was the first amputee diver to be certified or recertified as a US Navy diver. (Returning Applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the movie book: Shall I tell you just one of many "gaps"? Yes, I'll mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and do it ... The initial, crucial scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: They would never have taken the time to suit a complete Mark V diver, even if he was the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to just be "... a few minutes late" saving the pilot. <br /> <br /> So, by gaps, goofs and over-dramatization, I've ranked "Men of Honor" from a perfect 10 to a 7. <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood NEVER realize that the truth Immaculate is so much better than your over-the-top approach to storytelling? ? I doubt it. What a pity!
