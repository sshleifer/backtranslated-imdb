I cried my heart by watching this movie. I've never suffered from any eating disorder, but I think this must be a very true picture. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is excellent! She expresses these feelings incredibly well. My adolescence came back to me so vividly. Anyone who has experienced difficult times as a child or teenager may relate to this film. I recommend you all to see! <br /> <br /> The music is great too - I already discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I'm also looking forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White Ol√©ander because I'm sure she's perfectly suited for the role of Agnes.
