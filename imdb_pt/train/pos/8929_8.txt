In the first place, I greatly enjoyed the central idea of ​​locating the "intruders", Others in the Fragile Self, on several levels - mostly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, the intruders are ubiquitous throughout the film: on the Franco-Swiss border, where the pretext leads to reclusive life; in his recurring reverie and nightmare; inside his sick body after heart transplantation .... In the last half of the film, he becomes intruder, returning in the old French colony in the hope of atone for the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is more bitter than pathetic, full of regrets and guilts, the sense of failure being more or less dominant. This is a rather bleak picture of an apparently ostentatious old age, but hopelessly empty and lonely inside. The director composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings. Some of them are hypnotizing, not devoid of humor, a kind of absurd joke that only a sleepwalker can visualize.
