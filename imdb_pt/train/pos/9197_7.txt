This is actually a small and cool, made with absolutely no perceptible budget with video footage. It takes a while to warm it up. The acting is so bad that soon acquires zen charm. After some scenes, you stop to notice the awkward lines or rehearse the sound of some deliveries. All characters develop a peculiar charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I'd hire to play a delusional psychopath. He seems to like this a lot! Mixed in with the blood-mad scenes and zombie infestation are some really visual photos of the title character, "The Midnight Skater," touring the campus of black hood, looking around the world as a cross between the Grim Reaper. and, say, the Silver Surfer. These scenes do the sometimes ridiculous things that the characters say about the Skater seem almost sinister. The soundtrack features some very entertaining songs from Garage-Punk, and the gritty, raucous stinginess of it fits in well with the mood of the movie. Thumbs upish, I say.
