An interesting look in Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne as the first US consul for Japan arrives in accordance with the agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He's not welcome. Wayne finally wins his encounter with Shogun after bringing a cholera epidemic, brought in by an American ship, under control. There follows a colorful procession to the capital carrying gifts to the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The encounter with the Shogun, the debates between the Japanese noblemen and a murder during an exhibition of arch and arrow present an interesting look on the politics of the period. Overall, a pretty nice film, and besides, how many times can you see Duke losing a fight to a guy half the size of him.
