In stark contrast to the opinions of the other reviewer, this movie was surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see him and expected to be bored with cliches, obvious jokes and exaggerations, all of which the trailer had promised. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes I found myself really laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. With just a 'bathroom humor' gag, Over Your Dead Body can actually create funny realistic scenarios and, without spoiling it, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there; screenwriter, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this movie is high. <br /> <br /> Of course, you will not learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind, you will more than likely have a good time!
