This movie is a lot of fun, and any criticism is based on personal preferences - not on the quality of the films. In addition to the excess of swearing in some scenes of Murphy, the film is a great vehicle for your type of humor. It has some very good special effects, and exciting action scenes. As a discoverer of lost children, Murphy's character begins to search for a missing girl, which leads him on the path by which others believe he was "chosen" - to protect the child Golden. The child is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose own life is in danger, if not for Murphy's help, and his beautiful, mysterious, mystical helper / guide / protector. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are times of philosophical lessons to challenge audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child, which Murphy's character is asked to protect, is tested by the mountain temple monks. An elderly monk features a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose, and the child is tested on their choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy that is based on the notion that there are good and evil forces in our world, of which most people are completely unconscious. When we accept this premise of the plot, we must leave our contact with a perceived daily reality, and prepare ourselves for the earth and the walls to disintegrate, and reveal a kingdom of evil just waiting to destroy us. <br /> This is an excellent film with a good plot, good acting and, for the most part, a fairly decent dialogue, combining a serious theme with a healthy balance between martial arts and the humor of Eddie Murphy .
