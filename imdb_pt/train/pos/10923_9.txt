This movie is very good. The plot, which functions as a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings many surprises and makes a spectator really eager to solve a puzzle. The fight scenes are very good. There are many different fighting styles (although one of the styles is a little unreal for me, but it's just my opinion) to watch and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be annoying is the actors' appearance. A bit effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at kung-fu movies, especially in the 70's and 80's, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) is a great choice.
