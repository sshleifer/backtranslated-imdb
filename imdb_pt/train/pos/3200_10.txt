This is a great series of Canadian comedy. The film tells how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the main writer of the show and his friends Rickie and Bubbles interpret this as a true satirical look of life in trailers parks and despicable hood inhabitants. . The film will tell why Rickie and Julian begin their most advanced forays into the world of crime. Why and the reasons behind it all would be a spoiler, so I will not give you the real reasons behind your brighter escapades. His friend and frequent partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you view the sit-com a bit. It's a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire about life in the park of caravans and little cheaters with little ideas of time but big dreams in time. If you have the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this program, grab it. You will be glad you did. And to my American friends --- That will wipe you out, too. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. TV as the TV should be.
