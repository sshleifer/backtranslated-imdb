I really enjoyed this movie. I rented this hoping something not too bad for an overnight stay. It ended up a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be in a movie that was not meant to be just a stupid comedy, but with some meaning and moral values. She succeeds in both cases. The leaders are all good, but especially the star guy, also wrote and produced the movie. I've never seen any of these actors before, but they were nice and made me care what happens to them in the end, which is saying a lot. The script is intelligent, engaging and has a refreshing feel. . I guess you will not be disappointed to see this.
