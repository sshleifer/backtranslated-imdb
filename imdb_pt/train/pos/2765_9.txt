This is the French and the Belgians doing what they do best. It is countable, visually inventive, stimulating and emotionally challenging. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us into the world of Georges, a Down Syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone, anyone. This is not done condescendingly but with a great sense of fun and honesty. Georges' interaction with corporate management guru Harry is dazzling - moving from comedy to tragedy back into comedy again with a breathtaking ease. <br /> <br /> The Eighth Day puts Hollywood as Rain Man or Robert, Barry Levinson's Oscar winner. Forrest Gump of Zemeckis well and truly in the shade. Sometimes it evokes the mood of A Stranger in Milos Forman's Cuckoo's Nest, with Dennis Potter's tonalities being played to good measure. <br /> <br /> As the lonely yuppie emotionally dull and desperately, Harry, Daniel Auteuil transforms. yet another sublime performance. But he is reciprocated by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a film with uniformly strong performances and so many memorable pieces - the scene from the shoe store, the car showroom scene, George's dance for the "Jesus He Knows Me" movie of Genesis, the conference scene, the fireworks. If you have not seen it yet, there is only one thing to do. Just rent it or attend a screening at a retro theater near you and see what you're missing out on. Better yet, buy this movie. Pure genius
