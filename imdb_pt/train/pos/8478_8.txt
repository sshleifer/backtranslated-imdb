I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished ending ... I grew up in many great anime movies and this was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story about injustice, cruelty and loneliness, and life, and choices that can not be and the need of others. Chirin is done alone when the Wolf kills his mother, but the Wolf is also alone when Chirin follows him to the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, although every night it says "maybe I'll eat you tomorrow". The tape that I have is broken down and degraded with age and usage. I'll fix it and watch the movie again one day and cry as hard as I did when I was a kid. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this complexity of meaning are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never met any prettier catharsis. I'm glad I saw this movie and I'm glad I saw it as a kid.
