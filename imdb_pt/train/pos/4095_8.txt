Now my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (aka "The Beast" or "The Monster") can only be done in the old continent :), in this movie, we see everything: dirty sex horses, nymphomaniac gorilla type, etc. In serious terms now, it is an allegory, that men can sometimes be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It is an amazing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of shocking European exploration, I recommend this film. If you like this I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Altered States".
