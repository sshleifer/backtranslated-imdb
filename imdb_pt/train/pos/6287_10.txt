In 60 seconds, it was a great action comedy that made more than $ 100 million, but was criticized by most critics. I personally thought this was a great movie. The story was credible and probably has the biggest cast of all time for this kind of movie, including the 3 Academy Award winners Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall and the very hot Anjolina Jolie. plus the lame trick in the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (off the stick)
