This was a strong Poirot / Suchet, mystery television selection. The characters were vivid and well-represented. The plot and the main setting - a student hostel - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but for me it did not distract me from the story. A significant point, many observers of Poirot do not recognize good performance or good characterization. I also think they are quite tough on their judgments of some of the mysteries of Poirot. Finally, I have read a few Christie novels - none in recent years - and I find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about the changes in the novel. Please viewers, consider what is presented to you in the movie, not what you think should be there. That said, the mysteries of Poirot vary in quality, but not as much as critics and evaluators want you to believe. With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs, which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, Poirot's longer films are neither so good nor so bad. For the record, I saw all the longer films of Poirot / Suchet. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence. There is presence, however, either it is intrusive (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with Hastings. The lemon is in the middle.
