In the 1970s, Charlton Heston starred in science fiction films of varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the best. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 in New York. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn discovers the unpleasant truth about this product, he finds himself outlawed. <br /> <br /> I think it's natural that this movie looks dated to us these days. But even so, it still raises interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in their final role).
