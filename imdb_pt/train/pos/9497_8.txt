Absolutely fantastic rubbish .... this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions etc. He also stars the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other critic pointed out - although Olga turns into Ingrid later in the movie (you'll have to watch to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I will not bother going into history as it is too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the robbery scene to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were very good and then spoiled effects that seemed to have been made by the team that made City of the Walking Dead (ie strange blood spurting from neck injuries). <br /> <br /> I would advise low-budget trash fans to check it out if they can track down a copy - it's pretty rare, and I could not see anyone bothering to relaunch it, so it will all get weirder in a few years. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'd recommend it just for big nude scenes of Belinda Mayne! That lady is a fox!
