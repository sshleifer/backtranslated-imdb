Possible spoilers re: late appearances <br /> <br /> Rarely does anyone see so many fine and memorable actor actors (almost entirely actresses to be precise) in a movie. Even though some appear only for cameos, each is a gem. The British make this mix of comedy and real-life ducks better than any IMO, so it's no surprise that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> The music is great; no doubt a lot had to be dubbed (Leslie Caron * really * plays bass so well - maybe - who knows?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her hot, visceral sound still turns my eccentricity like a few jazz singers. As an aged musician, not so old and certainly not in this class of course, it was an entertaining film as well - a great film for anyone who imagined if it was already a profession or vocation whatever. And, of course, a great celebration of stage life. <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of the opening, but a tentative 9/10 - and it certainly makes us want to see the whole thing.
