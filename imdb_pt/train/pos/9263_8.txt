This is a totally delicious and unexpected movie. You start by following a young man who hopes to enter the soccer game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young man is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) are not allowed in football matches to "sit with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with consummate skill by a small cast. The film explores the absurdity of the restrictions on women's freedom (and also of the young soldiers who need to corner them). There are some excellent pieces, not least when one of the girls needs to go to the bathroom and, of course, the stadium has no bathrooms for women. Camera work is the simplest and, in a way, this story could have been told as a play. However, it is the small scale that gives the film its bite. Great movie? No, probably not; great entertainment - for sure.
