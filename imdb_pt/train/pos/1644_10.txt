I saw the last half of this movie about a year ago and I was very happy to finally find it available on DVD. I recently watched several reality series on PBS on ranches, etc. None of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does. Based on REAL reality, not giving punches, sad, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in the life of the border. The good performance of Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell contribute to a well-done script. The opening credit says it was made through funds provided through the National Endowment for the Humanities. If this is the kind of product that taxes could afford, I'd be happy to see more. I recommend and encourage people to tell a friend if you saw him and liked the movie.
