Simply the best Estonian film I've ever seen, though it's done by Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallinn Pimeduses is a fun thriller about a gang of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time, it is a kind of summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell to pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions may be better in most of these countries. But in the early 1990s many of these new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as an inheritance. (And many of them still do ... at least on some level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of the time with believable characters and a well written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the best-known Estonian actor, plays Snaut on Tarkovsky's Solaris), playing and an old gangster who is slowly getting tired of his way of life. But the most surprising performance comes from Monika Mäger, a child actor who plays Terje, a child girl in her early teens whose presence in the plot is absolutely essential. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credits list !!!) There are not many movies in the world that can be entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Unfortenately other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this type of achievements. His first, Kotia Päin was very artificial and his most recent, History is Made at Night was just a strange mess.
