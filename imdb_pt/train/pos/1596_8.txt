Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts to them - that's where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years - still in love. The whole cast does a good job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real slice of life. Although I've seen this a long time ago, I'm happy to finally have catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to opera scenes to kitchen table motifs - this is a very entertaining movie.
