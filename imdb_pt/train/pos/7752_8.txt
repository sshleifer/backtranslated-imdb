Bartender just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Simple like that, and he did it. Not only in your goal, but also in making a wonderful film, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow motion sequences, crawl photos, crane photos, etc. in a beautiful and soft way. This gives the film a very relaxing feel. <br /> <br /> The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party that they all watch, which is also the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this image is not in the question of how the characters have effect on each other (compared to a similar film, of course, better as Magnolia). I just do not think it was Bartender's idea. Beauty is in the different details of the experiences that people go through that make or break their lives. Bartender is very successful in telling these little stories that describe small experiences. He knows the people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack is also great, but it's no surprise, as we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band from us. The music is sometimes warm and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunshine and softness of the film. Other times we hear funky pop / rock melodies that give some scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There's only one flaw, and that's the last half hour. Was it the execution time, which was breaking me? Or were not the last scenes new and accurate than the scenes so far? I can not understand ... <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful sunny film that lifts the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> (It's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making it even more beautiful; it's the cool breeze that makes you relax when you pass a crowded party when someone opens the door ; it's the breeze that carries the scent of that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park you just met a week ago; it's the breeze ...) <br /> <br />
