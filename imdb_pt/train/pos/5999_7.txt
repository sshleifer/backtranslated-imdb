This is a strange movie for me, because after reviewing a cool movie for a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his movie, THE CURE. I do not usually review movies like that, but what the hell - I love shorts and could not wait to see another. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, while it turned out I liked THE CURE, I was not excited about it and let Jafri know. To his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway - giving my honest assessment. <br /> <br /> The film has a tremendous style and, as far as Jafri's direction is concerned, is exceptional - especially for such an inexperienced film. maker (it's his first movie). The combination of exceptional color, rhythm and music options that fit the film created a great sense of atmosphere. You really get pulled into the movie and that's a credit to the movies. However, the thing I did not love was part of writing. Although the basic idea was great, the end was too easy to predict. I really would have loved the ending if it was more of a surprise or an unexpected turnaround. However, considering that this film is from someone who should not be able to make a professional film, given their experience, this bodes well for their future. Good job.
