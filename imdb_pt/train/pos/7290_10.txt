After several extremely well-done SUPERB ratings, I was extremely pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and an extremely convincing demon. <br /> <br /> Initially, I expected to see many special effects and, like the caress of a lover, this surprised me. with the subtlety and the correctness of it. Brian, I am again impressed by your art, telling the story and your care with the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting, the plot, the filming of high quality and amazing effects, was fantastic. I just wanted it to be more. I look forward to the Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
