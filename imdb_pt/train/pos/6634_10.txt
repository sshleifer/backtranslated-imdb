How do you rate this movie? I admit to saying that this movie is not much fun, but the goal is not to tell a story, but the story! This is the first 'real' film in film history ('le Prince de Galles' was the first, but it was not technically perfect enough ??) and has undoubtedly a huge international value. These people you can see completing your day job in the movie had the chance to take part in a historic moment by becoming the first people to see themselves moving! And above all, the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very exciting when you think of the first people who saw it! What moment! Historical for science first (because the Lumi√®re brothers invented the cinematograph for scientific reasons) and for the art later. A movie to venerate!
