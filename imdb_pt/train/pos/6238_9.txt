An uncompromising look at a Vienna suburb of the 21st century, blending the stories of six groups of characters from former documentary filmmaker U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalist and intense observation film. <br /> <br /> After the worldwide spread of Big Brother reality shows, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to a disturbing and deep level. Difficult to like, but the unworthy part of European art cinema may seem cruel and decadent, but it manages to convey the alienated, nihilistic feeling of modern society in a commendable way. <br /> <br /> A must for lovers of world cinema.
