This movie is good for the TV. I like it because I'm a big fan of disaster movies, even being a family movie. Accuracy in the book's film is half-a-half They got the names of the right characters, but in the book there was no storm chaser, the car scene involving the Hatch family running away from the tornado was not in the book instead involved Dan hatch and his friend riding with a policeman on his way to the police station for security. and in the book Dan and his friend are 12 years old. That's all I can think of. Overall, this was a good movie, although it might have been a bit more accurate for the book. Did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes that devastated a small Nebraska town in 1980?
