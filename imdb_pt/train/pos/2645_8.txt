No movie caught my eye like this one has. You see, I wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty-five years. The first and only time I saw this was as a teenager that may have been the year it was released, 1977. What I remember from the movie is that it touched those deep emotions. so deeply that there is still an irresistible urge to watch it again. The intrigue that this film provides for the human element of father / son in quest and quest will surely touch every human soul that watches it. Because this movie has not been removed from storage and shown as many times as many other shallower movies, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: I got a copy of the movie and after watching it again I was delighted to see that my memory was true. The rating reflects the content of the movie. I would like to watch this movie on DVD, since seeing this 1977 production on a used VHS tape took off the overall quality.
