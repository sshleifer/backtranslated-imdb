This is a very intriguing short film by David Lynch, and saying that the name David Lynch is probably enough for a lot of people. This is your typical Lynch bid. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde has been crying, the brunette is talking threateningly to the blonde, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> With many moments of silence, but with the amazing music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. This short looks a bit like 'Mulholland Dr.', a movie I loved and therefore also liked this movie. It's probably especially for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you like that.
