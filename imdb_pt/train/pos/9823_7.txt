I really thought this was not so bad. Not a great work of art, but Dermot M was the strongest by far. Patricia Arquette was exaggerating most of the time. He was playing cello which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he's an incredibly handsome man. Very sexy. Add that to the talent, and almost everything he has done is far more tolerable. He always gives his all, even though some of the projects he's been involved in have not hit the highest mark. It is not the actor's fault in most cases. He unfortunately was in some strange movies that simply did not resonate at the box office. Always with first-rate actors, but it's not always a "hit". But it "worth every penny" of any DVD rented or purchased. See The Wedding Date with Debra Messing - one of his best movies in general. VALUE EVERY CENT! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, buy the quote!)
