Before that, the faulty "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this film adaptation of "Mother Night" is very true to the book and maintains the intention of comedy, mystery and tragedy. Luckily he was not Hollywoodized or idiotic in the movie "Breakfast of Champions". Another good thing about this movie is that you do not need to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do to Slaughterhouse Five). That probably goes for the Breakfast of Champions too, but they did such a poor job that you're better off just reading the book and not watching the movie! Nick Nolte did a great job on this film.
