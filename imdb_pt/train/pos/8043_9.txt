I've heard people say that this boring boring movie is. I do not think they were watching the right movie. This is not the prototypical action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about the newbie and his mentor who is about killing people. In this way, it works great, with incredible performances by Berenger and Zane (who do not wander around the film as he does in other roles - he actually seems to be acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. with the action at the end - a lot of it did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the buildup of the rest of the film. But watch Zane's face as he panics alone while Berenger does the dirty work.
