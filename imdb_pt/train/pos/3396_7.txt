Very interesting. The big turnaround was not a shock as great as maybe they had expected and it was very outdated, but it made my mind work. This really made me think of a world without vegetation or cattle and made me appreciate the world in which I live much more. Charlton Heston does a good job as well as all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was amazing. There was a lack of direction at times and many of the settings and backgrounds needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent film. The main flaw I could find was that I did not want the movie to end when it happened, I would have liked to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
