While I was at the video store I was browsing through the rental for a dollar and saw this little gem. I do not know what that was about, but I just had a thought-provoking instinct about it and wow I was right. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around two girls who have just survived a school shootout. One of the girls is Alicia, a reble adolescent who is the only witness to the full attack and another one is Deanna, another survivor who survived a bullet in the head for some miracle. Launched together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and move on. <br /> <br /> I hate it when incredible movies fall into the cracks. Because wow that a performance of Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was extremely lacking in special features. Oh, and some of the cuts in the movie were kind of shocking. But all in all an excellent movie.
