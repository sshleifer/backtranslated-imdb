After seeing all the films of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, etc. in the fifties, it's a great thrill to see this movie with a new perspective from director Ang Lee. The scene from the Lawrence, Kansas attack is incredible. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is great as the bad guy. All the time this movie makes you feel the horror of the war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive in the next few hours. Definitely worth seeing.
