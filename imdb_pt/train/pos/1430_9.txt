This was playing in our theater in Amsterdam and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so we went to that, not knowing anything about it, apart from being a documentary about the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune, for this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of Earth's inhabitants. This movie has some of the most stunning photographs I have ever seen in a movie and it has taken me to deserted places in oceans, rainforests and exhibited things I have never seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is a movie that every student should see before they get tired. I'm going to encourage my niece to watch this movie, since she will inherit the planet we left behind. This is also a movie to watch on a theater screen or on a very large television, since photography is so powerful and exotic.
