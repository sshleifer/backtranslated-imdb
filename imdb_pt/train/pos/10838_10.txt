I agree with what "veinbreaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling you have at the end of this movie. I simply loved the places they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic track in which Hans Matheson sings. It's trippy. Nighy was fabulous in her role, Nail "preached", Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea kept it together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was beautiful. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was in place! Too bad that not many musicians have marked this movie! You must have told all my musician friends. great quote from Jimmy Nail's character: "It's supposed to be rock & roll, not the Phantom of the Opera f *****!"
