Why does Dynamo have no pants? Where did they go?? This was never explained. That's why this movie was so incredible. In addition, Starsky gave his children AIDS !!!! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor! A I D S My favorite quote from the movie was "That hit the spot" A I D S. This movie went to the "birds". I tried to give this movie the "stinkeye", but it kept playing. What am I doing wrong???!!!! I thought the "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like for a show. Why did not Dynamo wear pants? I know his arm was stuck, but ... What about those crazy futuristic networks? Why did not this feudal face of the Ray Combs family get a net? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
