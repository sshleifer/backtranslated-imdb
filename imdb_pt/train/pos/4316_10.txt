I have to say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most affected movies I've ever seen. I've watched it several times and still feel like the first time; that this film, by itself, could compose the entire curriculum of a graduate course in film direction. <br /> <br /> Long ago, movie trailers used to promise: "It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry." This is a very banal and brief way of describing what the Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places of human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is rhythmic between people who are close to happiness and the same people close to the horror. It is always a short step too. Only to administer this swing gracefully and without making it appear false or overblown is the driving genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (of sorts) coming. After accustoming the audience to swing back and forth across the emotional spectrum, the film casts a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back, but increases from a common marital fray through an accidental self-inflicted knife. wound that may or may not require stitches for an earthquake that has the characters running from the house. At the time of her relief, argument forgotten, cut finger forgotten, the earthquake survived, a neighbor woman says her elderly husband collapsed. The couple rushes to their aid. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I am crying now. It's not sad that you do this to me. It is not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me apart is that these few minutes of film were PERFECT. Perfect! Amazing. (end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is a lot to say about the Grand Canyon. It portrays relatively ordinary people who experience epiphanies and allows the viewer to experience them indirectly. They are not flashy or exaggerated and there is no long pause to carefully examine the moment. The film continues in the rhythm of life. Even when the characters try to understand what happened, they are not sure what to derive from their experience. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
