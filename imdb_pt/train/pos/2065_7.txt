Fearful Symmetry is a nice episode with some flaws. The first thing about the episode is that it happens near the Mountain Home Air Base in southwestern Idaho. The season's "Deep Throat" takes place near Ellens AFB, also in southwestern Idaho. I'm wondering if the Air Force bases are one and the same but have decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always an advantage. Ed Meecham, the janitor of the zoo, reminds me of old, grumpy teachers. They must have liked kids at one go, you can not imagine how. Just as he must have cared more about animals at a given time. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt some inconsistencies. If aliens are so adept at kidnapping humans and returning them safely, why can not they put the animal back in the right place? And the aliens are now having trouble returning the animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. Like he's an expert at it. I also found that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these details, I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of extraterrestrials collecting animal DNA as well as human DNA.
