Catscratch is the best thing to come out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show not only attracts the Maori and the PI's. some people love it and they are all australians. At first glance, I'll admit it sounds a bit coarse, but it grows huge on you. Also, to fix something that one of the other reviewers said In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say "Does that mean you're homo now?" he says "That means you're homo, owww?" This is your phrase on the show. Mr. Blik is, I think, the funniest of them all, like the Peww-Weww Playhouse. <br /> <br /> First, I admit that the opening episode was a bit good. But after a while the episodes were great! And when the series discovered that it's surreal, crazy ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is for kids, but every once in a while there's a brilliant show that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults alike. These shows include Mr. Bean, the animated series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, the modern life of Rocko (sometimes) and Invader Zim. All of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> What I like about the famous final episode in which Gordon fights a duck. /> <br /> I'd also like to see a DVD, with lots of audio commentary and behind-the-scenes documentaries, including the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, what I would definitely like to see is the show back in the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closure credits. That would be good.
