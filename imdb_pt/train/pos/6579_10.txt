Think of the best screen version of Quo Vadis? always done. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and evident as in the book, sometimes snaking and losing its suspense between aesthetic subtleties. But the film is really and beautifully "weird", has a puzzle and style, that other versions - with R. Taylor and the new one from Poland - are definitely missing. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of declining paganism and childish Christianity. At least I believe you have). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did a great job portraying their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast (not to mention Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors of all time) and accumulates the very essence of this agonizing world (IMHO). That's it. That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
