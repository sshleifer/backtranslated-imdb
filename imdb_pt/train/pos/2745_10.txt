I've seen a lot of movies, but 'In Cold Blood' is alone in a class by itself. It excels in every department. Containing few big stars helps you get to the top as you pay more attention to their characters and their story instead of the name on the marquee. Blake and Wilson present stellar performances of the murderous duo. The fact that most of the films are filmed in the real places where the crime occurred, even inside the house itself, adds additional chills. Black / white photography obscures humor and photography is magnificent. There are a lot of great cinematographic works out there, but if I could just vote for one of them at the top of the list, it would probably be "In Cold Blood."
