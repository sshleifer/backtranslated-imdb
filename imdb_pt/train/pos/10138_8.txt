Well, it's time. I really gave up all hope that there would be a prominent episode in this season's entries. Although there have been many bland entries, at least this episode went well. It's pretty funny that director Rob Schmidt, who only has the bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito, whose only script tasks so far have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones that gave us the best writing and more thought. provoking episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we are treated with the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple is talking. Abbey caught Cliff cheating and he's desperately trying to win her back. As they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff gets scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and catches fire when a spark comes on and gasoline dripping on it catches on fire. And that's just the setup people. Once in the hospital, Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this skinless state with only nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect as well. Every time she flatlines, Abbey walks like a ghost and causes trouble for all kinds of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the best episodes ever. From the horrifying effects to the tense script that has thrown in some twists, I have never seen the coming and suspense so palpable that you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to continue living forever.
