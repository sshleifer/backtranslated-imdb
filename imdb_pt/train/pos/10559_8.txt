I have not written a review on IMDb for a long time, however, I felt compelled to write that! While looking for this film, I found a particular review urging people not to see this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! NOTHING is a fantastic movie, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are not you sick and tired of being force-fed in the same old cycle of chewing gum movies? Sometimes a movie like NADA shows up and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not even care if you do not like (even hates) the movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. The IMDb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative criticism should discredit the film in this way. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people they should not watch. We have our own minds and we will make our own minds thank. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, I would say that more people will like this movie as opposed to those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your mind with a little eye candy! I do not see anything!
