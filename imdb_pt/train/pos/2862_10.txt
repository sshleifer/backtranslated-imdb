My comment is generally limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This superb series was one of the first to be televised in color, and was highly influential in persuading Americans that they had to buy a color television set that was about $ 800 in 1959, the equivalent of more than $ 3,000 today. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a show broadcast by a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series began, and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Watching this now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. First of all, many of the story lines involve the Comstock Lode and the heyday of silver mining, which dates back to 1859. By 1859, arms and clothing, for the most part, are not authentic. (The haircuts are left out of the discussion.) This is basically a mistake. <br /> <br /> And it would have been impossible for Ben to have reached the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and have accumulated a square mile in the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of the Sierra Nevada in 1847, and the Gold Rush only began two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians are not interpreted by native American actors. John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s. The Bonanza producers could easily have done it thirty years later. This is a great detail to me. <br /> <br /> There are other timeline issues. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears, and he is described as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also faltered between 1859-1860 (pre-Civil War) and what was best suited for a period of 1880. There are problems of continuity, over and over again. <br /> <br /> It's a bit disheartening that there's so much slaughter in the first season. Over time, the murder was reduced. Many of the episodes have a socially liberal bent, which would be hard to believe given the timeline, but give writers credit for anticipating seismic shifts in the Nation's attitudes from the 1960s Having said all this, the performance is good, and I have concluded in my last years that the character of Adam was better than that of any other. I do not think Pernell Roberts got the credit he deserved. In addition, Season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories trace actual historical events. The invited stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This was great entertainment for the family, and the series stands out very well in any measure.
