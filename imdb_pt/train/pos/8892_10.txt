Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll elaborate. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is sooo cute!), The music was great (the 60s had the best music of all, imho), the historical stuff was interesting, and that's how they did the 90's actors It seems they were really there in the 60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that's the greatness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT!
