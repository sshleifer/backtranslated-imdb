Yes, it is flawed - especially if you are into Hollywood movies that require many effects, a story or storyline that is purely fun or fanciful, and you can not really think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films are for the clever movie buff, and Insignificance is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are brilliant, the story is great, but like all of Nic Roeg's films - you are thinking of every aspect of reality that would never have arisen in you before. Your movies always make you think, and personally, I like that in a movie. <br /> <br /> So do not expect to come watch this movie and feel happy, because you're likely to go disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
