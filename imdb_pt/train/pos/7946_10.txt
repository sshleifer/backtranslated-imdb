This film is a true work of art, it really is. It's rare for you to come across such a thrilling movie, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on tiptoe. A true family film, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they pass through and the obstacles they encounter. found along the way. One of the truly impressive things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - dubbing is so good. Shadow is a wonderful, old, wise and brave character, and seeing him trying to save Sassy in the river was a touching moment. Chance - who would not love a dog like Chance? He has to be the most mischievous and adorable puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very spirited by a cat - she put me in stitches when she was mocking the goalie; 'Here kitten kitten ... not in your life, chubby.' There were also many well-made emotional scenes, like Sassy going over the waterfall (I was really scared by her), Shadow falling into the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all the three pets come home ... including the good old Shadow! <br /> <br /> A favorite of all time - anyone who does not like this movie should not like animals. Rent it or buy it now and it will leave you with happy memories that will last a lifetime.
