Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family is 10% more disturbed than the movie, well, I think he could have gone worse. Unfortunately, the video print of this movie contains inserts of sex scenes originally recorded by the distributor to increase the label's box office appeal. Several times during the film, Milligan's ugly camera work and silent film music abruptly end, and suddenly good-looking scratches for Milligan's homegrown actors take over and begin to do so with the psychedelic guitar rock of 60's. It's pretty easy to move quickly if you're trying to pay attention to the original Milligan movie, which unfortunately is missing some action that has been cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains, however, is still somewhat convincing. I guess I've never seen a more odious mother in any movie before.
