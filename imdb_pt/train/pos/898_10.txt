It would have to be too tired not to be dragged into this movie gem (and I've also seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). The actors, the beautiful surroundings, the surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was just lovely. The (imperfect) human element has also been interwoven, to create some drama and to propel the plot, as well as to allow a sincere resolution. Alok Nath is such a fantastic actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he plays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves true romances - those who go beyond superficial beauty to real love - like one of the best movies out there, Hindi or not!
