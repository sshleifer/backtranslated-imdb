I got to see it on the plane to New Zealand last week, and I was wondering how that would measure both for the film and for the book in the UK. I have to say I was impressed. If anything, the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, which has succeeded over the years. As a British I was also interested to see that you do not need to understand baseball to get what is happening. One question comes to mind - was the script written using Sox as the team even before they finally broke Bambino's Curse? Or was it another team on the board? As a Red Sox fan myself (strange I know, a British who understands baseball) I have to say that this increased the pleasure.
