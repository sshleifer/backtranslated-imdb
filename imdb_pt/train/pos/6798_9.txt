(No spoilers, only plot details) I can not understand this hatred for this episode. Do you want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Underground - now there's a bag of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I do not say that very often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. The alternate universe scenario seems strangely realistic. The Martian Hunter, who previously appeared in "Static," returns and tells Clark that the doctor who is the head of the asylum where they are detained is actually a ghost of the ghost zone, and if Clark wants to go back to his universe, he should kill him. A great general episode, with good performance and a decent pace.
