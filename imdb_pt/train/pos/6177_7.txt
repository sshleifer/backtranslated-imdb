The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other offers developed from comic or comic pages. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium.) It's really ironic that this is the first and only adaptation (from the moment I write) of the clever alec of Eisner, wise and clever superhero. <br /> <br /> The story goes that Republic Pictures was interested in making a film version and was in negotiations with the copyright owner in the mid-1940s, but they never managed to close the deal. The screen game on the left became the series THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in the Republic. Maybe it was good, because the studio had a propensity to fiddle with comic-book-adapted material, cellulose magazine, radio, and comic books. <br /> <br /> As for this 1987 TV movie, It is quite obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. While a former comic book reader, such as myself, may be a bit harsh in criticizing an adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to give some new observations, free of any preconceived notions than this screen version should appear to be Well, while sitting and watching the story unfold, with the characters interacting amidst a wave of crime, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) came up with a statement. "That can not decide whether it's serious or not!" This very well describes THE SPIRIT and its creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius of comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on the screen. The cast of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really very well done. Although in a contemporary setting, it was still in the "good old days" tradition with regard to costumes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! This brings to the forefront (and winding), and this is what the director and the production made a conscious effort and managed to give the characters a Will Eisner as facial expressions and body language. We say, praise them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that no show has been followed! Well, in today's film world, comic adaptations seem to be a hot item. Maybe some great producer and director of timers could do a first-class production of SPIRIT for the big screen. We can only wait. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008. At this point, everyone who goes to the movies at Multiplexes Shopping Center saw the poster announcing THE SPIRIT's new movie, (subtitled MY CITY SCREAMS); which will be released on Christmas Day 2008. Well, we'll see what we're talking about then. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO CONTINUE ............. UPDATE II: We saw the new movie, the interpretation of director-writer Frank Miller of THE SPIRIT a few days ago. Well, we have our desire; but this is a good thing or another case of "Beware of what you ask, why can you get it?" Please read our article elsewhere on the webpage. THANX!
