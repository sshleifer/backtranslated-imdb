Everyone, my name may sound strange, but there was nothing left! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not seen anything like this before, so it was crazy! Of course it's a good thing. It's a humorously interesting movie and my favorite thing of all time is how they intertwine other things in one! Like little chicken, the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying "Twas beauty that killed the beast", War of the world scene and more. The Walt Disney company has not lost its touch, perhaps not for this. Also, as they did as if they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. As in the original lion king, were not Timon and Pumbah with Simba when he hit Scar? In this movie, they are not! they were fighting the hyenas behind the scenes. Also, the reason why Pumbaa is not so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone realize that only Timonn's story was told, while Pumba only had flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But other than that, it's "S GREAT!
