Well, I gave this movie 7. It was better than "Thirdspace", but not as good as "In the Beginning", in regards to the B5 movies. I really think the television series did a much better job with the special effects and portrayal of the characters. Let's hope the producers and cast get the next series "Crusade" to the standards of B5.
