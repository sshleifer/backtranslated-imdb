I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was amazed when I saw the rating of 5.4 for one of my childhood favorites. It did not impress me that much at age 17, but as a family movie it's a sweet and well-intentioned movie. Kids will love it and will not mind the flaws, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messages of the movie. None of the films were in any way preacher, in fact, it has a great message that adds to its sweetness. I admit, though, that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like the death of Screweyes (which still frightens me) can be a bit scary. But the animation is well above average with nice colors and good character animation. James Horner's music is very beautiful, and the music is memorable, captivating and entertaining. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the deepest of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part in which he tells Screweyes "I quit!" made me in stitches. My favorite is Screweyes, though, an effective villain who is smart and I think smart. If anything, though, I wish the film would be kept in the part when it explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows, because that way he could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its fun and stimulating parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. The dubbing for me was what made the film. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith gave solid performances, but a special mention must be given to Kenneth Mars, for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get the rating, honestly I do not know. Of course this movie is not perfect, and it's not as good as a Land Before Time dinosaur movie, but it's a lot of fun. 7,5 / 10 Bethany Cox
