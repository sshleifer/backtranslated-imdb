I thought the film could be a bit more complex, maybe psychologically, but the action and the dubbing were top notch. The CG animation was heavy on many scenes, but very good at it. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies, which include novels and the conflicts of Wayne and reasons to date. 007 fans would love this, just like the females, great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film, and Penquin was back in his true form, with no mutant genes in him this time around! I liked the fact that Robin was not very accustomed, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a bit of an indigo child or future mind. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was composed of a novel. stars, decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors as well. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> I rate this below Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman Vs. Dracula, but I liked the smart script more than Subzero. 7/10
