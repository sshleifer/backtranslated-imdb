As someone who has lived with the cerebral palson for over forty years, I think this movie is inspiring. If someone with such a severe CP case as Christie Brown can do so much, then there's no reason why I can not make my own dreams come true. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker give incredible performances. <br /> <br />
