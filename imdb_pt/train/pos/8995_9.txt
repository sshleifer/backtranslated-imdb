I did not find anyone to watch DiG! with me because nobody I knew was a fan of any of the bands. Of course everyone has assumed that you can only enjoy this movie if you like the music of The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way the two groups' races are parallel is a perfect representation of the paths that a band can follow, and watching the public eating and spitting out the Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other comments that mention that it would be good to get a final word from Anton himself as he is clearly described as his own worst enemy and the bulwark of the band's ability to just stay. <br /> <br /> More interesting to me is Dandys' respect for BJM (despite his lack or retribution) and Anton (despite his erratic behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art the group produces, even if the group hates everything the Dandy Warhols now represent (though this is debatable). The best phrase is when Dandy's drummer says, "I will not have them anywhere new again" and the guitarist unconsciously says "I still buy their records." For me, this shows how good music can be powerful. <br /> <br /> Definitely watch this movie, even if you do not know anything about any of the bands. It's more about the rock themes and how they develop that make this movie so interesting. It is rare to follow a group so closely for so long.
