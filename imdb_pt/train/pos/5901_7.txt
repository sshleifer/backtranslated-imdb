It's a repeat of many recent movies, only this one has fewer stars, fewer complications and a more fuzzy feel. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol, respectively) meet at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (without their knowledge) begins its process of being arranged. Within a short time the two strangers are married and sent to a honeymoon camp, where they find other couples going through movements similar to theirs. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and / or patched and they love flowers. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-and-Ishq, then you've seen this movie. The plot twists are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the movie. Everything is predictable. I only liked it because I had seen 'Darling' (also starring the Deol & Khan leaders) earlier in the day and I liked their chemistry, so I said 'why not' when my sister suggested we rent Just married too. <br /> <br /> See: Because Kirron Kher is a co-star and is his usual sweetheart. <br /> <br /> Skip: because you've had enough of all this without meaning. ! <br /> <br /> C +
