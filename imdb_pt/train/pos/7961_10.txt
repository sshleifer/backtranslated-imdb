"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about domestic animals. It deserves a place among the great movies of the genre and even the world of cinema in general, along with other films of animals like "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". That means it's more than just a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Can this be just a "remake"? It's too good to be a remake! I've known this one by heart since I was a teenager (when I was 12). <br /> <br /> It's a family movie to cherish. It is emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, fun, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, emotional and sometimes dramatic. It's one of those movies that puts a smile on the faces of those who enjoy this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> This movie does not lack qualities. It has a well thought-out story, pleasant characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, stunning scenery / scenery of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (Oregon). Speaking of the views, there are all the mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... in conclusion, all the wonders of pure nature - truly a complete overview. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are good, well developed and well portrayed by the respective actors. Robert Hays is amazing as the kind hearted father, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is equally as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as the younger brother and cute Jamie (his appearance really reminds me a lot of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our quadruped friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, loving and loving Golden Retriever (brilliantly expressed by Don Ameche). Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). The chance simply can not stand still. Sassy is the epitome of the image of cats: elegant, independent, very confident and proud, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful breeds of cats. Sassy is dubbed by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are themselves great "actors" by nature: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's an underrated movie, but a classic in its own right. Its sequel is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
