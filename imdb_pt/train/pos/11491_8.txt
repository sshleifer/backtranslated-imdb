Unborn is a very different film. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the movie and performed well. This movie is solidly built and keeps you going. Although I think you should be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot. There is a brief nudity sex scene that could have been left out and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me in the movie and think things spoil a good movie, but that's it when it comes to that. There's a scene where Adams's character goes mad and kills a cat, but you can say it's not real. The music is very different, but very good. The Unborn in My Opinion is a really scary movie that is superbly unpredictable and this is pretty weird! I recommend all the horror fans for this movie!
