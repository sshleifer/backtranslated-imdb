This is my FAVORITE movie all the time. It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I saw this movie for the first time with my Aunt Brend and my sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I read lots of comments about why Bud left Sissy and how Sissy has to "learn to act" married. But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie right now, not when I was eight, it's about Bud & Sissy's relationship to make a turn for the worse because she makes a fool of him in Gilley. bull. They go into a huge fight. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinks two mistakes will do the right thing and Wes asks if "she needs help". They're all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam, "When are you going to take me home and rape me?" Pam replies, "When you're ready, Cowboy." Bud goes home with Pam to his apartment in downtown Houston. What Dad bought for her with the oil money and "all that it implies." Bud is the one who fools Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he comes home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Bud. So it's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he's a real "cowboy" and get her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has yours, I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I got a REAL cowboy! I love you too! :)
