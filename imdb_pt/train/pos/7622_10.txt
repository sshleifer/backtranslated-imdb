I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so exciting and terrifying ... so it was part 2 of the pilot ... I'll definitely keep tuning in to this show! This is the real survivor! I looked at some of the other reviews and I can see that after only one or two episodes the idiots here are already crying wolf ... Sorry if it's not another reality show, kids! There was a time when there was ... now get ready! Real TV Shows! And this is really good, unlike most shit sitcoms today or the eleventh carbon copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series that they are distributing ... See for yourself to form your own opinion, don 'T get one of the boneheads here!
