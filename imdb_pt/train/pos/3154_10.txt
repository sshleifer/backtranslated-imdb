This show is so much fun! the jokes are unique, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the eighth season is no funnier because Eric and Kelso are no longer on show, and Randy is a real jerk. Randy is, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not get the funniest characters and trade them with the type "I'm a nice guy" (Randy). it's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the eighth season funny, it still is, not as much as the previous seasons, but that's okay. <br /> <br /> The 360's are amazing, the circle, Red is a true type of mentally abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-loud. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favored characters are Jackie and Donna. they're cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great show. Idiot!
