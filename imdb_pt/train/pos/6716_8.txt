Afternoon, great drive-in explorer of Grau Z par excellence, Al Adamson really outdoes himself with this glorious and ghastly musical comedy atrocity that blends delectable and sombre depths into sheer celluloid nonsense and jaw-dropping stupidity. In the dark totalitarian future of the year 2047, sex was considered an illegal act by the incompetent and impotent idiot of Big Brother, the Controller (a playfully clumsy Erwin Fuller). However, Cinderella sweet'n'sexy (radiant blonde Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. With the help of her effeminate fairy godfather (a lush Jay B. Larson), Cinderella attends a grand ballroom with the specific plan of seducing the handsome stallion Tom Prince (the idiot Vaughn Armstrong) and teaching everyone to make love is something positive. pleasurable and totally acceptable activity. <br /> <br /> Adamson runs this ridiculous strand with his usual incompetence of all thumbs, staging the incredibly horrible songs of music and dance sequences with a lack of skill and totally uncomplicated style. The noisy number "We all need love," with people in absurd fantasies of animals hovering awkwardly over the forest, is a hilarious and hideous wonder; Ditto the equally abominable "Mechnical Man" with a lot of clumsy robots. Louis Horvarth's raw and static cinematography, cheesy plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's disco score, free nudity (the delightful hot brunette Sherri Coyle deserves special praise in this particular department), childish attempts to humor humorously (Roscoe the Robot law enforcer is especially annoying), and evenly terrifying performances (Cinderella's grumpy stepmother Renee Harmon's outrageous portrait of Cinderella protects the grand prize of booby here) further enhances the succulent and abundant roughness to be savored in this delicious and terrible donation.
