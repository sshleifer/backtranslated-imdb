This was a very bold film for the day. It can even be described as soft-core pornography for the age of silence. It was a talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited and in German. No one needed it anyway. (19) Hedy Lamarr gets stuck in a loveless marriage with an obsessive German (stereotype?) and after a short period in a marriage that has apparently never been consummated, returns home with his dad. <br /> <br /> In a famous and entertaining scene, she decides to go swimming at dawn when her horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to run through a field running after her as she leaves her clothes on the horse. An engineer retrieves his horse and returns his clothes - after getting a look. <br /> <br /> They sit for a while and, in a Zen moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. That's when she thinks of her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. She knows this man is different. <br /> <br /> She returns home and eventually seeks out our young man and finds the ecstasy that was denied him. You can use your imagination here, but your head disappears from sight and we see you squirm with pleasure. Since he never took off his clothes, you can imagine ... Certainly a tribute to women by director Gustav Machat√Ω, and a shock to the public of 1933. The only thing that spoils this movie beautifully filmed is excessive guilt and a strange ending.
