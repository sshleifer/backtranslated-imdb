After Dark, My Sweet is a big, modern noir, full of decadent characters, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the truly great ones of the last two or three decades have occurred in the South, where men shine and women shine as well. Because? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least men do - sweaty women make me sticky). <br /> <br /> Anyway - there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a wonderful example of all that a noir should be - constant rhythm (although some with attention disturbances refer to it as 'slow'), clearly and widely drawn (though not simple) , and tons of atmosphere. Noir, if anything, is about moods and attitudes. That is why the big ones are not marked by their traditional definitions of "great" acting (see Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime film is exactly what you want). or fast-paced adventures (again all the big noirs seem to be burning slowly like a cigarette). Great noirs create an environment and you only live with the characters for a few hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet let's do it - and let's enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - never allowing the audience to know what really makes them vibrate - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are perfect, especially Dern (see previous review). They take the basic contours of a character and give them depth and provoke our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better plots in the noir world (almost no mystery here - most are suspenseful), but this one is solid. If anything, the plot simply "well" has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. With Thompson, the plots are almost secondary; he avoided the labyrinthic tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger and more confused characters. Look for a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you will immediately see (from the title) what it all is. When it comes to Thompson, it's not about that, it's about that (to quote Roger Ebert). So really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and, if you do not like it, well the jokes about you. <br /> <br /> Why this is an 8star movie instead of a 10star is because of the female lead. She's not bad by herself, but she's not Angelica Huston or Anette Benning (see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters if you do not know what I'm talking about - besides being a better movie and you should start with contemporary noir - is the best of the 90's and defies Blood Simple for the title of Best since Chinatown). She just does not have the chops (or the looks) and although she and Patric have some chemistry, I do not have it with her. Come on then.
