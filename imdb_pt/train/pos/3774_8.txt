In the continuation of Bill and Ted's great adventure, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth, to kill Bill and Ted in order to change the future. In a great combination of comedy, Winter and Reeves stand out to offer a delightful mood to the public in this entertainment sequel. Bogus Journey still has the great slogans and dialogues of the first couple, not to mention a hilarious performance of William Sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Stay tuned for game sequences, the best time in the entire movie, but one of the many great techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although still packed with humor, this movie has a more dramatic film about it, with stakes being more serious and riskier situations. This gives the film a large dimension and another lovely feature. Creators also extend the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and sky being strongly symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again seen with the use of this incredible time-traveling machine, though again somewhat confusing in points with the use of time, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final pairs. The first watch I hated this sequence, but the second time was a real joy when I enjoyed the jokes and the story more, and although the jokes and the plot are not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has quite good motives, jokes and a relatively stable plot to make it a good family movie.
