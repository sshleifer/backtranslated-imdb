1958. The quiet southern city of Clarksburg. The evil sheriff Roy Childress (the all-powerful Vic Morrow in his unpleasant form) overthrows the sprinters by forcing the said delinquents to fall from a cliff to their premature deaths on a particularly dangerous stretch of road. Childress finds his game when young and cool pilot Michael McCord (a splendidly smooth and taciturn portrait of Martin Sheen) appears in the city in his poisoned car with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (Sheen's brother in real life). Joe Estevez in a brief appearance). Director Richard T. Heffron, working from a tense and intriguing screenplay by Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the 1970s drive-in movie gems "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), reports the thrilling story at a brisk pace, sharply creates a flavorful period setting of the 1950s, and cleverly leaves enough suspense out of the tense game of wit and wills between Childress and McCord. The uniformly good cast helps a lot: Sheen radiates an impetuous rebellious sense of James Deanesque in the lead, Morrow takes full advantage of his part of villain, plus excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as sweet waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin Nick Nolte as gas station assistant, Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as Buzz's younger brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as Sissy, Britt Leach as the lousy cab driver Johnny, and Frederic Downs as the tough JA judge. Prostitute. The climax of the vehicular confrontation between Childress and McCord is a real exciting and impetuous. The sharp cinematography of Terry K. Meade, the well-designed characters (eg, Childress became obsessed with speeders busting after his wife and son were killed in a fatal incident), the groovy, syncopated score by Luchi De Jesus, and the scenario of beautiful mountain all further enhance this winner's overall sound quality from made to premium television.
