Kalifornia came out in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 main characters were on the rise and reaching the levels of fame they now have in 2006. This is a good psychedelist that should please all fans of David Duchovny because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their way into their work, as with most of their episodes of the X-Files, Kidding of God, and Red Shoe Diaries. <br /> <br /> People who have been put off by Brad Pitt's strong southern accent and the characters of Juliette Lewis have obviously never spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there's an "Adele and Early" and in 2006, that's the true horror of this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think the film was written with a cult movie intention - like Carrie's photography, it is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of that in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your taste for weird movies.
