This movie was lovely. An accountant wants more out of life than approved conventional success. What makes it work so well, and make it so different from the standard dance movie, is that it's not really about becoming "Great," but simply finding a way to express yourself. The great triumph in the end is not the achievement of a contest, nor the discovery of a totally new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want for other parts of your life. No one is discovering their passion, they are finding their soul quiet. <br /> <br /> The Japanese context makes subtle oppression and the "secret life" of hall dance understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the common man.
