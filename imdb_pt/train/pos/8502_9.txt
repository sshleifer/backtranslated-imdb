Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is in charge of attracting a Japanese auto company to come to his city, creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one hilarious moment after another. The two cultures clash and it's up to Keaton to keep things together. Look for great performances by Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly launched. Do not be fooled by the low score. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of the town of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
