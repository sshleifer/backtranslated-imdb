Ah, cliches, cliches, cliches; They are a major part of a wide variety of horror films. This one has many of them. Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of terror. This movie was very good, just very predictable. And what horror movie does not have stupid people? This is overcrowded with delayed victims practically begging for their life to be taken. Pet Semetary I found a little scary. The way everything is set up was really scary, but not terrifying. Most of the time, the acting was somehow believable, the suspense was not so full of suspense, but the level of entertainment is set in an important position; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans should see this movie but, like everyone else, expect an OK thriller.
