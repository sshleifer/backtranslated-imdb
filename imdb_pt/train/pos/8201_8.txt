Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at one point in his career when he established a good reputation as a director. The reason, in fact, is not the film itself, but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism, which it seems to support. In some places, it actually owes more to the Death Wish than to the original Dirty Harry movie. One can argue if this is so - at the end of the day, it is a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day, it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments, it is easily forgotten that the sudden impact is a very well done film. Forget the "Go ahead punk, make my scene of the day" which is iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air, enlarging the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are spectacular. Or take a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So, all in all, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that shows how Eastwood is mature as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood put it on screen, albeit in a moot action film of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first well-directed film that Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). Narrative space takes the visual elements into being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog farting.
