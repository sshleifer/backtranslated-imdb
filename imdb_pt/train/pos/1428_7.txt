There is a spectacular, heart-stopping beautiful photograph here of a variety of landscapes and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything else. Camera techniques are varied and can be seen from close-ups to aerial work. The edition is tremendous and the commentary is on the spot too, with the right tone and some dramatic and revealing facts about our world. Where the film falls a bit is in an attempt to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate changes, individual animal stories, and hunter / hunter interactions in various environments. Eventually, everything gets a bit fragmented and disjointed. Overall, worth seeing especially considering the issues covered but do not expect Oscar material.
