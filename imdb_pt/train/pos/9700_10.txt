Somehow, this film manages to be invigorating, bittersweet and exciting at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (of Providence) give life to the tale. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate life, up and down, through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. Paulie begins her life as a parrot chick given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, otherwise known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that is being said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an elderly artist, Ivy. She teaches good manners, etc., as she travels the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with several twists of fate until Paulie ends up in a laboratory where he is eventually hidden in a basement, and found by a Russian janitor who is touched by the story of the bird. the plot is in accordance with the simple and metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful mix of flute, digital base and horns enhances the film to the point of pure bliss. The camera's radical angles and breathtaking scenery embellish the story even more. And, as a final remark, the puppets are totally believable. (Unlike Star Wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies, with the added observation that my wonderful four-year-old parakeet has recently died. Overall, I give this movie a handful of four stars, two thumbs up and one big hug.
