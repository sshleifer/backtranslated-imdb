I've always said that Batman animated films were a lot better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated films, but outside the group, this is the poorest, and it's quite disappointing. "Mask of the Phantasm" would be the best, then "World's Finest," then "Sub Zero," then "Return of the Joker," and finally this will be the last. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated film, there is a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman intends to find out if she is friend or foe as she prepares for revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce engages with three young women, he begins to investigate them and finds out who the new girl is. <br /> <br /> The tone in this film is unusually light, considering that most of the films are somber and somber, which was rather disappointing. Bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time, villains are reused from the latest movies, and while the action scenes are exciting, they are nothing new. Also lacking the dramatic impact that the other films have, especially the one of "Sub-Zero", that was heavy in the development of personages and drama. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film seems well recycled and the supporting characters are charming, but no one really worth twisting. <br /> <br /> All this time, I really enjoyed it, I had a lot of fun, and the identity of the new batgirl is amazing, but that was not as exciting as I was. d expected. <br /> (half out of ****)
