Here, on the wiki I read an opinion, that Gray Owl is the best character Pierce Brosnan ever made. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not a fan of him, but this one was really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing - awesome hand of the film director. I give my respect. The serenity, beauty and spirit of the desert were illustrated in a truly exclusive way, I have never encountered such closeness in any movie before. <br /> <br /> Another thing that stayed in my mind after the movie - this is the movie, the closest the original books and atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respect to the original gray owl.
