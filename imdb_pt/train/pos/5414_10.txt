This lucky 1940s military swashbuckler, based largely on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem, as well as his novel "Soldiers Three," qualifies as first-class entertainment on the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant does more blows with fists than in all your movies together. Set in distant India, this six-fisted string inhabits the prowess of three robust British sergeants and their native water bearer, Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who faces a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians named Thugee. Sgt. Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen of "The Informer"), and Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of "The Dawn Patrol") are a tough trio of tough, tough-drinking Alpha-males, whose years of play are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and get into the tea business. Of course, Cutter and MacChesney create various schemes to make Ballentine's plans unfeasible. When your superiors send you back to action with the sergeant. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote from "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so he can not accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half the fun here is watching the directors trying to cheat each other without hating each other. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in style and scope as our heroes mingle with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his excellent black-and-white cinematography.
