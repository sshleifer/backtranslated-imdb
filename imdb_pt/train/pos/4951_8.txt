In all honesty, if anyone told me that the director of Lemony Snicket's series of unfortunate events, City of Angels and Caspers was going to make a small, low-budget indie movie that would be really good, I would say that person should be kidding. But that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was very good. "10 Items or Less" has a similar concept for films like "Before Sunrise," "Lost in Translation," or more recently "Once." It involves the casual encounter of two people who, if serendipity did not put them there, they would probably never cross, or, if they did, they would not say to each other. Like these movies, "10 items or less" focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters understand each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story involves Morgan Freeman, playing an unnamed actor who will research his role as a grocery clerk for an upcoming independent film and because of things beyond his control, ends up spending the day with lady in the 10 items or less track played by Paz Vega. She has a rotten marriage and hopes to get a new job as a secretary. Initially, Freeman's character only needs a ride home. After spending some time with her, however, he wants to meet her and maybe even offer some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is just a setting for these two characters to interact during most of the 80-minute length of the movie. Freeman has fun with his character, as he appears a stranger in the lower-class world that Vega's character, Scarlett, inhabits. Vega, however, grows beyond the stubborn clerk of boxes, with the situation of his life wanting to move on. <br /> <br /> There are some things that really stand out in this movie. First of all, Siberling probably took independent film to make sure the relationship is sincere and does not fall into any Hollywood trap. It's a very common friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works, although the situation itself seems a bit inconceivable. <br /> <br /> I'm also impressed with the performances. While Freeman's presence lends credibility to this film from the outset, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun that is not normally seen from him. Paz Vega, meanwhile, is preparing for a breakthrough in American films at some point in the future. I loved her in Spanglish and she is as good here as Scarlet, tough and sensible. At the end of the film, she successfully conveys the growth of her character. I look forward to seeing you in more movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 Min items work best as a character piece, well scripted and directed by Brad Siberling. He has not done much writing and his work in the movies has consisted mainly of major Hollywood films. However, there is certainly an artist working here and I am anxious to see if he will take this road again.
