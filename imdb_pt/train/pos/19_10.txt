I just read the comments from TomReynolds2004 and feel like I have to jump over here. I understand he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this movie is that it is not afraid to travel the darkest roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two people, as portrayed, has many reasons for bitterness and anger, but to find tenderness and comfort in each other. Only excellent acting could make it work without becoming an emotional, sentimental, and sentimental mire. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them for such strong performances. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for her actions in the Vietnam era, but personal feelings aside, she is fabulous in that role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first I've seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than endurance to sell a character and I really like that. This movie was a big surprise when I first saw it and I look forward to seeing it again.
