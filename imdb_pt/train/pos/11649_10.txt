What an absolutely stunning film, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch, you will not regret it, it's a lot of fun! Rajnikanth carries the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing beyond him, I still liked that. A.R.Rehman's music takes time to grow in you, but after listening to it a few times, you really start to like it.
