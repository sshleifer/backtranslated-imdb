A lovingly remembered melodrama? thanks mainly to the excellent central performance of Ronald Colman at the Oscars? on a frequently treated topic: the nature of the performance and how it can overcome the perception of reality. In this case, we have a famous actor approaching "Othello" by Shakespeare, so that the last third of the film delves into the thriller genre? with press agent Edmond O'Brien (who is actually in love with Colman's co-star and former wife Signe Hasso), "investigates" the actor's possible involvement in the bottleneck of a waitress seeking a celebrity a very lean Shelley. The theatrical / New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war era is sharply captured by Garson Kanin's writing team, Ruth Gordon and legendary actor director George Cukor (all nominated by the Academy for nominations); Incidentally, the film won a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score. Colman, forever the gentle blessed leader, plus a velvety voice, do well enough for Shakespeare? gaining conviction the more his character becomes obsessive jealous, a murderous fury and eventually paranoia; however, he is not disappointed by a support cast that also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer, and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the middle section is a little tense, the film compensates for all deficiencies with a remarkably manipulated Expressionist outcome.
