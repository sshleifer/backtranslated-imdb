I think it's unfortunate that the main commentaries on this movie include the words "No-nonsense and Terrifying". I think it's a very funny movie and great entertainment. It is necessary to suspend the disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love, have a child and live happily ever after. But it's always wonderful to see him in a movie and have a warm heart. Is that so impossible? There are many more implausible events described in other films. The acting is good, the script is funny. The only negative comment is that the story could have ended when the family moves away from their home, rather than extending to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality.
