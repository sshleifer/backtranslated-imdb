The WAQT is a perfect example of chicken soup, not just for your soul. Unfortunately, the broth lost its real flavor, thanks to all the dilution and excess trim that went into its manufacture. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing about WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual cliches. of Hindi cinema in his first venture, but that in his second exit yields to all formulas of stereotyped films. While Vipul Shah was convinced to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in AANKHEN, he simply failed to induce life in all WAQT packaging that is based on something as conceivable as a parent-child relationship. Adopted from a piece of Gujarati, Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, the WAQT has a sensible plot with a social message to support. A mature look at the parent-child relationship, the father's unconditional love for the child, and the child's responsibility to the family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who established his entire empire on his own from scratch, leads an affluent life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). His only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), has never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor-made and fed with spoons in his life. Ishwar's pampering only spoils him even more. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does nothing to fulfill her dreams. Meanwhile, he marries his girl Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that the marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still at her best leading a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The limit of resistance finally collapses when Ishwar expels Aditya from his home. The sudden change in his affectionate father's attitude towards him and his now waiting wife confuses Aditya. He has no choice but to fight for the support of his wife and unborn child. He begins to become an independent man, but the division in the relationship between him and his father grows. <br /> <br /> The story is simplistic, while the uncomplicated script has a very elementary approach. One can easily identify and relate to the credible characters of both the father and the child. If you are not one of the two, at least you may come across people like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to that the director Vipul Shah is easy to handle with the script. With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the lawsuit under the film laws of Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker. However Shah excels in the easy handling of emotions for most of the film. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre-break scene in which the father expels the child from his home in a rather frivolous manner. The aim of the scene is achieved without erasing the weight of the brains of the audience. The same goes for the scene in the second half of the year when the now separated father son has an irreverent conversation. This is what differentiates the WAQT from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an EK RISHTAA and in fact puts a high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after gaining all the points of distinction, one may wonder where the WAQT still fails at? The problem lies in the fact that while WAQT distinguishes itself from the others in its league in terms of treatment, it yields to failures in terms of packaging. What with the director forcing on song-n-dance from time to time in the first half. There is a Johar kinda shaadi song, a Chopra Holi music medium, a father disco dandia parent song, a dream song and a dream come true, inducing enough yawning at the viewer. Imagine this ... the father has just expelled the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! Out of Reason! and the audience Outside the seat. <br /> <br /> The film only drags in the first half and the real story begins only in the second half. The director wasted a lot of WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much-talked-about dog-chase sequence is not bad, but neither is it redemptive. However, Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine that he qualifies for the star-hunt in the movie with this histrionic hilarious (unintentionally). Add to this the climax established in the finals of the hunt for stars, where the son explodes with emotions. This is so archetypical! Also the standard of editing could have been reversed to hide the parent's reason for the change of attitude toward the child. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is good, though unnecessary in the process. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera is competent enough, although not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia presented some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make up the moments of light in the film very efficiently. While Rajpal Yadav has gone to sea with his comic histrionics in many movies out lately, this time he underestimates his character and is completely restrained. His expressionless expressions are perfectly complemented by Boman's exaggerated histrionics. Shefali Shah is convincing in the role of the mother. It should not be construed as censorship, but she is perfect at interpreting and "looking" at her character. Priyanka is beautiful and does her part well. <br /> <br /> Of course the main applause they deserve is Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his loving father intentionally rebukes him to make him aware of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan is a bit dramatic in some scenes, its brilliance affects the whole film. <br /> <br /> To summarize, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is somehow not. t both appetizing.
