After being completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there would be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is fascinating !! I absolutely love this show and I can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful scenery are incredible. I am totally and utterly addicted. I do not know how the creators do this, but each character touches me deeply. I feel your joy, your pain, everything, to my core !!! I do not have cable, so I've been renting the series on Netflix. When I put it on, I watch all the episodes at once and I'm sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next record to arrive at my house. This is probably the best TV show I have ever seen !!!
