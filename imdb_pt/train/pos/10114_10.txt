"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary about the man's life that brought us movies like "Glen or Glenda," "Bride of the Monster," and of course "Plan 9 from Outer Space." This exquisite film far exceeds other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion", failed. He rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have died since filming, and does an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that he looks at the darker corner of Hollywood's past, sentimental in his directorial treatment (even haunted music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film, lovingly and retrospectively, bring together Ed's life and the premature death of the viewer. Best attended at 3 am while wearing an Angora sweater.
