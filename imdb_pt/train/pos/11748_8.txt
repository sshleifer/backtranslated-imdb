Stumble. I must say that at first I was a bit disappointed in the first few episodes, but having faith in the show, and the unquestioned talent of Abe Forsythe, I continued to watch. I can safely say that now I'm glad I did it. The story has developed very well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most have no missing information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can criticize in this production is the rather annoying voice and pronunciation. owned by the character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> A good performance coupled with a stellar plot really does make this show go on and on. Here is the hope of another season!
