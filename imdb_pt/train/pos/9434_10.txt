I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago and not paying much attention, maybe even lost the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was a boring and overrated film. I decided to revisit it last night to see if I missed anything the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most disturbing and surprising movies of all time and clearly had a lot of influence on the movies today and will probably be forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give the performances of their careers and are backed by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox.This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and fear for a long time after watching it, it is truly horrifying. Oh, and did I mention that theme music is great, too? Well, it is, and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for the experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
