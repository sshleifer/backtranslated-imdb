As a kid, I thought this movie was great. I had animals, had beautiful music and had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various acrobatics and scenes that look great on the camera. He has a beautiful, well-written musical that fits perfectly into the scenes, with fast-paced melodies and the main theme of the heart, which still makes me cry. Even when people hum. And there's my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three domestic animals, an intelligent, overconfident, and pretty paternal lab called Shadow, a witty and vain-but still clever-cat with a fear of the water called Sassy and a ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic clever, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when the family leaves. Discouraged and worried, the animals leave and plan a trip through the mountains of the Sierra for the journey of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So maybe the house is on that mountain. But what if it is not? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound to people who like the three incredible actors providing the voices to the animal's main characters, and to anyone else who ... yes, everyone will watch it.
