Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie delivers the products. It seems that a vampire is loosed in a small German town draining his victims from his blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his first roles, is skeptical of believing that a crazy killer is not a vampire who is freaking out. The only person who believes him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), the girlfriend of the inspector and laboratory assistant of Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who, although apparently an eminent scientist, agrees with the theory of the vampires. The town's people suspect that the quirky Herman Gleib, played with his usual frenzy by Dwight Frye, who seems to be enjoying his role very much. The film contains a bit of humor that helps to alleviate some of the intensity involved in all the murders committed. A funny part has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, thinking that Herman did not become a bat, but a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. This budget film brings elements of "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestion to make a sleepwalker perform his orders, "Frankenstein," using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" since the murders are believed by all except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a leech. These elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Strayer with a small comedy released for good measure. The mix works. The restored version I saw used dyeing to enhance the scary atmosphere. Then try to view this version if possible.
