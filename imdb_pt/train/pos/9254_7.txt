no movie with dennis hopper, stockan dean, marilu henner deserves a rating below 5 here. This is a movie version like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight Race, except that the prisoner being hauled here is the very easy one for Ms. Enleniak's eye. Tom Berenger plays another rebellious military type and William Mcnamara plays his rookie to be excused. The plot in front of this is absurd, because I lost track of the times that Eleniak should have and could have escaped, but this is a fun well-being film and there are good special appearances from all the above actors that keep the movie running. This is not really a family movie, as there are some profanity and a rare nudity scene with Eleniak, but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time.
