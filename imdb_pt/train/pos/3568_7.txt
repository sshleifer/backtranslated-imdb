This movie takes the Cinderella story to the early 50's and makes good, if eccentric, use of the Isle of Man as a backdrop. Ugly Sisters have become glamorously savage upper-class English girls and, along with Kathleen Turner as the stepmother, they amuse themselves in many wonderful period costumes. The story is somewhat different from the traditional version: at first, it is strangely combined with the plot of "King Lear," and in later stages Cinderella is more assertive than usual. It looks splendid and works generally fine but sometimes surpasses the top.
