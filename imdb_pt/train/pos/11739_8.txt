"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is a species of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her job as a host of television horror movies after the owner of the new station cheers on her. She is now counting on a show in Las Vegas to get her going, but discovers she needs to raise more money to start the show. Things seem impossible to raise the money until she receives the news of the death of her aunt, who then leads Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will. A house that needs repairs, a dog and a cookbook are all that's left for her by her aunt, and again it seems that Elvira is having trouble getting the money for the show in Las Vegas. The adults in the small, narrow town make things worse for Elvira. Only the local heartthrob (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will be her friends. Elvira's uncle, "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard), presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon discovers her powerful heritage that includes casting spells and some very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell her cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to lay hands on him knowing his power. Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old accusation of witchcraft and the confrontation between her and her uncle. The plot is quite simple, but the humor and the well-developed characters keep it in good rhythm. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of cute, coarse, obscene and intelligent humor performed by the many visual jokes, puns, props, songs and parodies. The touches of the film's occultism make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It's a well done film, with great acting from all the artists; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease"). There are also good special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if Elvira's character could have a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, YES!
