"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of the 1980s directed by John Hughes. Everything happens in a world of chewing gum color, where everyone is attractive, there are some easily resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the almost always happy process, and large amounts of plot are summed up by mounts made with lively pop tunes. Nothing wrong with that, though. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treat from start to finish. My wife and I were totally overwhelmed by the cornball fight, even when we were having fun, and in the end, as embarrassing as that to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our bedroom life, not in a theater ). Watch this movie and have fun. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
