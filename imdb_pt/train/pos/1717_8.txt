The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol) - who is witness to professional marriage, in short, he acts as witness for couples in the marriage registry office - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) who ran away from his home in Nainital to get married with her. love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha waiting at the wedding registry office for Dhiraj to appear, but for some reason he does not show up. Then Ankush appears in the photo here, who approached Megha with the intention of winning Rs. 200 for his Jehovah's Witness work and he ends up helping her by providing shelter for her. Ankush grows up next to her, working at a bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Megha and she also falls in love with him (or kind of love), both agree to the marriage and Dhiraj back in the picture. Unexpected circumstances happen, in fact, I must say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of the film is a bit different than the movies we see and I do not think this will be accepted by the public. Masses, but if you're a crazy movie like me and like to watch something different then you definitely will like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story elaborated very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel like things are happening to the guy next door. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it's good too. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a feeling of freshness. <br /> <br /> So, let's summarize and summarize. <br /> <br /> History: A very common story is transmitted very well and has turned into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, how was the creation of Himesh Reshammiya, so I did not expect much, but still I liked some songs from the movie including Qawwali. <br /> Performance: Abhay Deol was the most stunning, natural and innocent performance, but he should stay away from singing in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll, I must say. Again acting very innocent and natural and these two actors fit perfectly into their characters. In addition to these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and there may be few layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors have done their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also give 3.5 stars out of 5. You will like the movie if watched in the movies, I would recommend watching the movies if you are a freak movie and accept unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to arrive. The film will definitely not be appreciated by the masses and the deal it can do is through word-of-mouth advertising.
