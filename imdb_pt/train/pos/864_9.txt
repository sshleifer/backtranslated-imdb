Certainly, one of the French films of the decade so far, an atmospheric, tense thriller that makes full use of the main characters, hearing the impediment of using sound in a way rarely exploited in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos offers a truly impressive and multifaceted performance, sometimes dishonest and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for the offerings of France.
