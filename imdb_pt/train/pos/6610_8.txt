In 2054 Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is abducted, Detective Karas (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance is a splendid blend of films. mingling with a futuristic conceptual narrative that illuminates the screen in a shocking mansion with a noir ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many. <br /> <br /> Pixar are the masters of animation. His countless Oscar-winning films are endless, from the charming Toy Story to the mysterious Wall-E, and any business or director has a real challenge to bring them down. The Renaissance is not a movie aimed at young audiences, and like the 2007 Persepolis, it brings a strong and mature approach to the animation genre to make an older and more challenging film for the older generation. <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant Sin City noir that rocked all the use of green screen with a splendid balance of black and white footage with the strange outbreaks of color and, a year later, Christian Volckman took a similar approach with this equally visually magisterial film thrust. <br /> <br /> Volckman's photo, however, is full of animations but does not seem realistic for most of its strong 1 hour 40 minutes duration. The faces of the character are well portrayed and in particular this movie has to be the best of all for the use of the shadow. The fact that we never know if their night or day is irrelevant when we simply look at the faces of stone as the shadows blend into their expressions. It is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed as well. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, you will have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best directed animations ever selected for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style of Marjane Satrapi <br /> < Renaissance is equally on terms with this image and in many cases rivals stronger graphics and darker shades to reflect mood. One particular scene when Karas appears out of the darkness is beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The narrative revolves around a stubborn and meddling political government that watches over every citizen. The Paris race is in the mysterious Avalon, which we do not see nearly enough to get an essence of its true domain. Renaissance is controlling the narrative around the attempts of a police officer tired of rescuing the mysterious woman, and then we see Craig's tired and tedious police trying to rescue him while fighting with other elements. There are many things wrong with the script, not to mention the tired exasperated police routine is now old but there is plenty of adrenaline rushing and springtime joke among the characters to keep him alive until one last shockingly beautifully shocking past stages.
