... and I mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen all the movies already created!), At least obviously among those I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The basic rule of the IMDb is this: Sometimes very well-rated movies (eg, the Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Kraap segment called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely does a movie worth watching is rated at less than 6. This movie, which is worth watching, is. A disgrace. <br /> <br /> True, I give a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Your true rating should be an 8 or a 9. You have some flaws in acting (especially Belafonte), the script wanders at times. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved Zero-Mostel, bigger than life, and the sublime Ida Kaminska in a performance / tour de force poetic / moral. A couple made in heaven! It is true that this film, with minor flaws aside, does not favor the average public, but those interested in watching an excellent (though again, not beyond criticism) film from the incomparable director who gave us "The Store on the Street Principal "(the best film about the Holocaust) should not miss it just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that" American Beauty "is better than" The Angel Levine ". <br /> <br /> It is not.
