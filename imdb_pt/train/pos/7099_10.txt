Terry Gilliam's fantastic and distorted story of a virus destroying almost a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about him is a fantastic, stunning and highly stylized design that sports Bruce. The best performance of Willis. <br /> <br /> What sets the 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel science fiction films is that the character Bruce Willis deals with the psychological effects of time travel, that is, without knowing what reality is the Current reality: the place where the time traveler comes or goes. In addition, the film recognizes that the things that have passed can not be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, can not be interrupted or altered. As Willis states "It's Already Happened," while he's in a psychiatric hospital, the biggest dilemma the film enters is not an exaggerated and overblown plot to save the world; instead, it is Willis's inner struggle to simply survive on himself. It's a new, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a script well written by Peoples and Gilliam's only dementia brand. <br /> <br /> In addition, Monkey's 12 narrative is totally non-linear and chooses to distort and double the way the story is skillfully told, incorporating a bunch of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories , the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is taken from Hitchcock's Vertigo. All serve to envelop the viewer in his disturbing cacophony of madness and futility. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate indignation and shadow that rivals Tim Burton in his setting and impressively discouraged images. With a cold, wide and immersive cinematography, Gilliam immerses himself in the colorless environment and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, white and dead and help contrast with the characters who often deviate from the madness. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, filling them with a patented loony and off-the-wall performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant and tragic man. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis's psychologist. She sustains herself, injecting her character with wild energy and force as she falls under the weight of what she believes to be a false "religion." <br /> <br /> Gilliam's treatment, expert, overwhelming and complex of What could have been a routine action / science fiction film makes the 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a futuristic and terrifying landscape. His rich, well-thought-out and intricate plot, along with bravura performances from the entire cast and his somber cinematography, make him a masterpiece of madness. Ranking in my top 10 all-time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly prodigal spectacle of a movie full of brilliance. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
