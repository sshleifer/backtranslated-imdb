"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not on the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it definitely has many brilliant moments. It basically follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have normal lives and go to school, living in a 50's style neighborhood. The mood and animation of this show is very much like "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you can see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's good, it has funny parts. Some of the songs are great, some not so much, but I like this show. The funniest character is Brak's father. (this is human, nobody knows why)
