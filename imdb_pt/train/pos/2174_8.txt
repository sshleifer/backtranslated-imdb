I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later dubbed French in the 1930s. Although it has the voice of another person dubbed his own, this remains an impressive tour de force for Louis Brooks. The fact that her voice is nicknamed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps placate the purists about the deception of dubbing. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and his friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her inside the car changing to her swimsuit. Lulu is very free with the display of her body and this does not fit well with the annoying Andre. When Lulu considers the nomination for the title of "Miss Europe", we know that a happy ending will not be at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus a lot on men who like beautiful women. We see many bath beauties and the reactions of men looking at them. But at the center of it all is the magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from the past, consider checking out this. Louise Brooks is not a name that most movie buffs may know, but as soon as you see it, you'll be mesmerized and want to know more. Also, check it out in 'Pandora's Box' if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be suspicious of the release of the US Kino DVD. I do not know if the projection speed is correct. Many scenes seem to be shown at a very fast speed. That may have been the way they were filmed. I do not know. But as it is the only way to see this movie, it is worth to swallow this little bitter pill.
