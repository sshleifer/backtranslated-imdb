Great. Initially, I thought that, given the communist tendencies of Amrita Pritam and Dr. Dwivedi's film of nationalist tendencies, it would be more outspoken than innovative, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find it was reverse. <br /> <br /> Kudos to marita Pritam for not being pseudo-sec and Dr. Dwivedi to be objective. This film addresses a sensitive subject in a sensitive way. Victims of any war are women, as one poet says, and this film personifies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, since they can not resist the abductors of their girls or the Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor. On the other hand, it also shows the economic angles behind the partition or, in fact, why the girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think the kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and therefore new government. will not be able to ask them to return the homes. This distant has to welcome the courage of Puro characters and their Bhabhi they are two simple village girls unaware of the outside world and risking everything trying to return after being dishonored. Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> No wonder it is necessary for a woman to understand the pains of other women.
