*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film that Rainer Werner Fassbinder has ever done and even with the wonderful script, the film is enhanced by a great Hanna Schygulla performance. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just getting married while the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is sent to the final days of the war and now Mary and her mother and sister must pass to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute at a club that serves American GI and she meets a black army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they begin to see each other on a constant basis. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she becomes very serious with Bill. But one day, as they become intimate with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He did not die and when he enters the room, a fight occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long run in jail, so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and take it out. The war is over and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job. Mary is determined to do good and goes up the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's lover. She tells him that she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann leaves prison, but goes to Canada to try to overcome everything Mary has done since being locked up. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything in his will and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally arrives home to his wife and they are both ready to start the marriage, although they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with the two still inside. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this movie that it is one of those films that can be studied and spoken about. to large lengths. As with all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins, the tones are brown and gray to represent Germany devastated by war, but as Maria begins to succeed, they switch to rich, bright colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany, with all the sounds of construction, is used as a backdrop and the film remains focused on the exploits of Mary. Fassbinder wanted the sounds of reconstruction to remind us of what was happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a minor actress, this would be just another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria very determined and intelligent, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed or guilty about it and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard a lot about the end of the movie and it has to do with the fact that Mary left the gas on purpose. Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she seems to be sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please e-mail me. I think she was very excited for Hermann to be home and left by accident (remember her putting on a dress for no reason?). So when the will is being read to her it is at that moment that she finds out that Hermann and Karl have become friends without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing. That's the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes by accident. But I think the reason for Fassbinder to have such an ending is to show that anyone who would sell his soul has nothing to do with business. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In her opinion, Mary can not have both. A fascinating movie.
