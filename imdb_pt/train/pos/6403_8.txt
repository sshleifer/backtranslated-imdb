MEN OF HONOR presents Cuba Gooding Jr. in what is probably their best performance to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the south, who wants to become a Navy diver, but he has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist redneck who, however, grows to respect Brashear. The film is about how Brashear has to agree on the almost insurmountable odds, not once but twice. The performances are what make this movie special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of cinema, gives an impressive performance - his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as the much younger wife of DeNiro. The film puts patriotism a little too strong (though not close to the PATRIOT level), and some of the characters are only one dimensionally bad (Mr. Hal Holbrook's Mr. Pappy is so mean), but the film is a rarity among films of today. It is uplifting and non-cynical. A wonderful film.
