The Maxx is a deep psychological insight mildly camouflaged as a strange story of superheroes. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in a filthy, nameless, crime-ridden city, and she and everyone she knows have a lot of problems to solve. Maxx is your friend and client, a street bum who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> The Maxx is not to be wasted by the work of art, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly the deliciously urban voice of Barry Stigler, dripping and evil from the main villain, Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see it, do not miss it.
