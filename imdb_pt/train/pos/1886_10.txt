I have loved this movie since its premiere in 1981! I've lost track of how many times I've seen it! Never stop making me laugh or cheer me up if I'm feeling down. The three tracks are fantastic and the script is invaluable as well as how you do not get nostalgic listening to the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the whole script, so when someone is watching for the first time I have to hold on to something about how the next line is funny. I can not even diminish it, although Sir John's character is probably the most memorable. The famous "I'll warn the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a shower is still invaluable, but the list is really endless. The scene in which Arthur is about to be the house of a fianc√©'s father is a cry, particularly his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
