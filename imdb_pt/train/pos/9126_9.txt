This movie is great and wonderfully marked. Oscar's Prince for Music was richly deserved (many people do not know he earned one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch as a late night couple on DVD. A big surprise: Prince does a great job, and is very good at transmitting pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at supporting roles. Very cool milestone movie.
