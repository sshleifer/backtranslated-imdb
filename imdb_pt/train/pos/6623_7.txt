First things first, this movie is painfully beautiful. Someone who works in 3D CG films as a lighter composer, the look surprised me. Every second I was shocked at what was on the screen. As for the story, fine. This will not ignite the world, but if you like your futuristic tales of Blade Runner-esquire (and who does not?), Then you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I felt the dubbing was particularly bland and harmed the film as a whole. I saw it in English cinema, but I hope there is a French version floating around somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
