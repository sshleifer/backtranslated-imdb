I do not know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a strange title and the description looked something different. From time to time it's good to try a movie that is a bit different from the mainstream movie of Hollywood hero / thriller and this movie certainly was different. From the beginning, this movie intrigued me, but I could not figure out why until the end of the movie when I realized the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was superb and the character's development really makes you care about them and expects things to go well for them in the end. I think everyone who watches the movie may somehow relate to one of the characters and it gives a great insight and some good laughs with the simple simplicity of the actors. <br /> <br /> At the climax of the movie you definitely have a feeling of well being, and you get the kind of feeling 'things will be fine'. I'm sure this will have great appeal and should have a chance.
