Fabulous actors, beautiful landscapes, harsh reality. I will not elaborate on all the reviews from other reviewers, because you get the picture! However, the film is not for scruples. The reality is to shoot down pigs and other animals to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's book of inheritances. I read this several years ago, I have to reread it, since I watched the newly released, remastered DVD of the movie. <br /> <br /> I tried buying the video for several years, finally bought used from a rental company that came out of the market. But Yippee! The DVD is now on sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but worth it to me. This is a movie that I will watch until the end of my days!
