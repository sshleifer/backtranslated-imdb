I've seen this movie many times and I like all the bad teachers want to give ten out of ten, but they think it would be unfair to other good movies. However, I think this is one of the rare gems: a perfect comedy. It's just that I would risk one of the greatest comic movies of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and incompatible. The script is so sharp that you need to stop the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other reviews. The two tracks give extraordinary performances, the girls are superb and the situations are fun. No swear words (check Hollywood, you do not have to be funny, you have to be witty) and the change from the stage to the movies is perfect. They do not do that anymore. Eternal.
