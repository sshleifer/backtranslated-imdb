I really love this movie, I never get tired of watching it. The only line I really can not understand is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but otherwise, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the Ramones were until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her little face most of the time. Most of the people who watch this again and again are fans of the Ramones and really ... that's the only reason I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing DeeDee mess up his Pizza lines or Joey mess up the teacher's name several times, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is watching them sing, you want to dance, through the hallways of the school .. I love it. The DVD special edition has a good retrospective, surprisingly the PJ Soles is not in it. Maybe she was working on another project * laughs * Anyway, great movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
