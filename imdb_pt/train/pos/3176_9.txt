I happened to catch this movie at a screening in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; has a lot of crazy characters, but let's just say I'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh more, I would not know where to start. Even the peripheral papers are well written and well represented. <br /> <br /> There are numerous little touches that make it unique and very enjoyable, it has some "devices" that appear and add another hilarious layer. It is refreshing to watch; Not some recycled things I had seen many times before. If this movie could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a great pleasure for the audience, the story is so original and sincere. <br /> <br /> There is much here to like, funny stories, mishaps and misunderstandings that establish the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; is a poignant story with fast comedy woven everywhere. Definitely worth seeing!
