The film was a long awaited release, which was a little disappointing because of the anticipation I had created. When looking at it again, I must say that it is actually quite good. First of all it is very true to the original story (of course not completely) and is, as such, made just to keep right for the movie. The story of Modesty as a child is shown and is very true to the original. The performance may not be the best and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to the 1966 Vitti movie it's much better just because it's not trying to be a musical. Usually I would only recommend this to fans of Modesty Blaise or to someone who picks it up on TV.
