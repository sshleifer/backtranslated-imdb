I was lucky enough to watch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially the tricks of William Castle, so this was definitely a must-see for me. <br /> <br /> This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underestimated director. It's true that he did some cheap horror movies, but added something to those movies: real live theater tricks you do not see anymore. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack in their movies and put vibrators in the back of the chairs in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is really a well-made documentary and it brings this rather gloomy director. to the light, and celebrated his contributions to horror movies. He also paints Castle as a character larger than life, who was very dear and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most movie documentaries that mainly show wills of movie historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mainly of his family members and directors who have been influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. A must see for classic horror and science fiction fans.
