Pretty good romantic comedy in which I think I've never seen Meg look more beautiful. All the players did a good job in keeping this a lively joke. Of course, in the real world, no genial mathematician would even look at some fat monkey, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... someone can totally forget about reality and have fun. Good movie. Damn, Meg is a baby, right?
