This "adulthood" movie deals with the experiences of two girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love a fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his excellent work on "To Kill a Mockingbird," the film never hits a fake note. All the acting is superb. Like Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes an impressive debut in the movies. Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking out the window at reality, instead of watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie at least 5 times and I can honestly say it's one of the best movies ever made about being young, being in love and going through the feelings, challenges and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between the ages of 10 and 15 should attend together and use them as a discussion piece, as this raises several questions about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent etc.
