I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of Paramount's extensive chain of vaudeville homes. This Paramount has a 'Mighty Wurlitzer' organ? also magnificently restored - that was used to accompany the silent films of the time. <br /> <br /> We were fortunate to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international resurgence of silent films at Mighty Wurlitzer, playing the appropriate films. musical compositions and themes adapted to the action in the film. The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the whole experience was a unique chance to see a silent film as it should have been. <br /> <br /> It was Greta Garbo's first American film. She was only 20, but she already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. <br /> <br /> It's a little ironic that this is a silent movie about an opera star; although the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene, it was necessary to leave much to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Do modern audiences, for the most part, misunderstand silent films? The performance was different, with expansive gestures and wide facial expressions. So the audience laughs at inappropriate moments? the acting is seen as "hammy" and super-made? but it was simply the style of the period. Garbo, with all his subtlety, did much to usher in the new era of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read in a look down or a simple shrink of shoulders. It exemplifies the truism that 'a picture is worth a thousand words'. <br /> <br /> Although this is Garbo's first American film, it's pretty obvious that the studio knew what it had at hand: it was the MGM movie. is better. The scenarios and costumes were magnificent. Special effects ?? Which by today's standards are very weak ?? they were still electrifying and surprising. <br /> <br /> The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) seems to be tailor made for Garbo; she shows her strengths, expands her resources and there is a troublesome linguistic problem: a Swedish actress can interpret a Spanish seductress without any suspension of disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> His co-star was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day would ever have done in a movie: to allow himself to look unattractive, to appear foolish, and to grow old without grace. <br /> <br /> Are there any good parts of the character that are more than properly acted? especially when you consider the power that Garbo was. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as "Cupid" and Martha Mattox as "Dona Bernarda Brull". <br /> <br /> Was that the extraordinary director of photography, William H. Daniels, met Garbo ?? they made 20 films together. (He was the director of photography in 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was her photograph that was primarily responsible for the nickname she became known for: The Divine Garbo. Without her magnificent skills, she would not have been the success she had. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a very rare opportunity: if you have a chance, do not miss it.
