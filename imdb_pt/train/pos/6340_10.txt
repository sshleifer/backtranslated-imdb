First an explanation about what makes a great movie for me. The excitement of not knowing what's coming will make me enjoy a movie the first time I watch it (case in point: Twister). There are also other things that make a good first appearance, such as good humor (John Candy on Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative narrative (all episodes of Star Wars - George Lucas is THE MAN), and good music (again all episodes of Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times at the movies and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. With that being said, I introduce Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Outstanding performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, particularly Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But, all the scenes with Cindy and The Grinch put together are great and very funny and / or moving. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason for the movie to be better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can not start because I do not want to ruin everything). Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch, particularly when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow!! Great music by James Horner. I loved your selection of instruments and compositions. Very good job Jim Carrey, I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Wow!! Your voice is reason enough to watch the movie at least once. In your solo - Where Are You Christmas - is your voice really as loud as it sounds? Sounds like an F #? This is an obscene interval for a 7 year old (obscene meant the best way possible). Good job. This is the best performance of a child I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor defeated Von Trapp Children - that's no small thing!). And now for the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and, surprisingly, very sensitive (this actually showed through his scenes with Taylor Momsen). The unspoken expressions of Taylor Momsen (one of the secrets to a good acting performance) are very strong - she really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when she does the dialogue, she's even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** danger: spoiler alert ******* ************** *************************** ********* *********************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when she sees the Grinch for the first time. This is a classic quote ("You're the one" and then filled in with the GRINCH line from "THE GRINCH's" after it falls into the sorter and then is rescued by The Grinch). " Thank you for saving me "quote and subsequent response by The Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. best interaction and small Taylor Momsen is completely safe with Jim Carrey in this place. I sincerely hope that we can see Taylor Momsen in many other films to come.All everything was great about this movie (except perhaps the feet and noses).
