This was a very nice film. A humorous, yet poignant look at the family and the obligations that come with it. The story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his father's bathroom in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, to appreciate the same things from where he left home. The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally handsome.
