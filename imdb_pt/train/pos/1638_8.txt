Heartland was in production around the same time that Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland cost a fraction, but it's 10 times the movie. Heaven's Gate was "the biggest and most expensive ($ 40,000) 1980's Hollywood flops of all time, its failure resulted in the sale of the United Artists studio for MGM" -imdb <br /> <br /> Heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing, directing, photography and acting. It easily attracts you to the beauty, joys, hardships and sadness of the pioneers' lives. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Hollywood sometimes dumps millions into turkeys (based on a director's greatest success) and overlooks such a wonderful story. .
