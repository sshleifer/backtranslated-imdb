This is one of the top Finnish films this year, although Tango Kabaree comes close. Director Lampela made a few years ago another little film called Rakastin eponistatorista (I was in love with a desperate woman). Joki is truly true to real life. beautiful movie on a Saturday afternoon in a small village / town. The actors may not be so cute or beautiful, but they act beautifully. I certainly hope a lot of them get JUSSI statue (OSCAR Finnish) next spring. I think this film could do so abroad as well.
