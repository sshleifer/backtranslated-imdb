I love this anime! I was laughing out of my head with all the jokes and violence (especially from Akane Ranma's reluctant but "tempered" bride) is so rude that Ranma really deserves it, but he tries his best to make up ... awkwardly. The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall on the damn Jusenkkyo Spring and turn into a girl when splashed by cold water. From there is a pure chaos, one after another. Among the highlights are the maddened brother and twin sister of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the perverted Happosai all causing problems for our hero / heroine. However, it is Ranma's selfish father, Genma, who ends up being the one to blame for the mess most of the time. If someone wants an anime that is funny, this is the one. It's softer and better with the Japanese stunt.
