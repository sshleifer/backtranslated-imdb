In areas where they overlap, this quality film is light years ahead of Innocence 2004, which gave the impression of a dry eye and heavy breathing attracting young girls. Here, the effect is much more realistic and really goes into the head of the three protagonists while they get in the way of a teenage tragedy. The three directors, all unknown to me, give very safe performances, the kind actually that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this acting quality in other films, so I would not be too surprised if they were not heard again. It would be nice if this could leave the Art Houses and enter the Multiplex where there is an outside chance that you can "talk" to the crowd of unseen chewing gum.
