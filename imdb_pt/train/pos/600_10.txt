Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who travels thousands of miles to visit his absent millionaire father (the scary Ray Wise) on a windmill-strewn ranch and ends up entangled in the perilous web of his intriguing and seductive young stepmother from hell Clare Wren), causing problems for the already dysfunctional family. A daring, elegant and thrilling drama that received no promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I first saw it. He is beautifully written, intelligently represented and rigidly directed from a script that keeps him biting his nails. I can not believe the reviewers who did not like it never really saw it. It's an undiscovered classic.
