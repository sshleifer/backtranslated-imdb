A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid representation of a country deeply divided within itself (for more evidence, check out some of the comments on IMDb ...!). He compares extremely favorably with Oliver Stone's "Commander" (which is mainly a close examination of Fidel Castro's nostrils). I do not know if Chávez is all he is presenting or, still, another in the long line of Latin American populist caudillos. I also do not know if he will be able to make up for the huge expectations he has built clearly among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is unreasonable to expect such a film to be able to answer such questions - but surely now I have a good idea of ​​what is at stake and what it is like to be caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the movie "we're making history," and that's exactly what the movie looks like it's capturing. Remarkable things.
