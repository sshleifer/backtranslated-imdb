This helps if you understand the Czech and can see it in the original language and understand the Czech obsession with 'The Professionals', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is another great Czech film. It's funny, dark and extremely nice. The biggest compliment I can afford is that you never know what will happen next and even hold that feeling the second and third time. For a small country, the Czech Republic has produced an incredible amount of world-class films and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor, by its very nature, is obscure and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This movie is just that, it is rude and deals with the less loving sides of humans, but beneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise, good intention and optimism. <br /> <br /> I recommend this. and most of the other projects that the Trojan and Machacek are involved. Have fun, it's a movie made just for that reason - anyway, it's the closest the Czechs ever write a truly happy ending ...
