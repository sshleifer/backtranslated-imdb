The third Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard film is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It is another adaptation of the Burlesque piece that was apparently popular at the time. <br /> <br /> The original part that Burlesque competed on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and is the role Carole Lombard plays. Barbara Stanwyck originated on Broadway that brought her to Hollywood. A version starring Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later in Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me. <br /> <br /> In fact I have a version vinyl album of radio that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler made for the Lux Radio Theater. This is interesting work, believe me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, MacMurray and Lombard do very well with the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Notice a good performance of Dorothy Lamour as the Latin shrew between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his first films as a wolf in the brand for Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low looks really cool today and I would not be surprised if we see another version of Burlesque for the 21st century.
