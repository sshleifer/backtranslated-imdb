"They All Laughed" is one of those little movies I'm always recommending to friends looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the ancient romantic traditions of the past, but it seems more contemporary. Even the atmosphere decidedly from the early 80's does not come out much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole undertaking so light on his feet that reality never makes him fall to the ground. But that said, this kind of small, sweet movie depends absolutely on the actors to continue, and "TAL" is blessed with a cast of dreams that understands the requirements of that kind of story. It is a film that would not last so long in the memory if it were not for the little moments provided by the excellent cast: the glaring orders from Colleen Camp to John Ritter and his dog; Blaine Novak let loose all that hair under his hat; and especially at the moment when Dorothy Stratten falls in love with John Ritter and says, "How strange ...". It's such a cute piece that you do not want to put too much into it for fear of crushing it, but it certainly leaves one with a light heart and a smile on his face.
