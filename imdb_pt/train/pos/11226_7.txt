Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it's a fan-made series, available only on the web, and relies mainly on friends and neighbors who have computer programs, home video cameras and sewing machines for, like Mickey and Judy once put on a show. It's definitely friends and neighbors, you might say. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you've ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest? some of them stumble in their lines as if they were walking on marbles? some of them have dense accents, or just do not seem to speak well in the first place, which makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word they are saying. Still, you have to admit that for all these friends and neighbors have created, it's really fun to watch. Yes, some of the dialogues are fake. Yes, it's a little weird (although I admit it's a bit cool too) to see two Starfleet men kiss (although some of the kissing scenes seem to continue) Yes, you shrink when they clearly quote ST: TOS, TNG, others shows, and movies, or when you hear the Galaxy Quest theme at the beginning and end of each show. OK. We can get through this. Because? The graphics are first rate. Better than almost everything you saw. And sometimes a show or two really stands out in the story? some of them are really real. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is a guilty pleasure in every sense of the word ?? but you have to give people credit where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to produce such a production. People, scenarios, fantasies, graphics? It's a huge effort on the part of many people. We watch, we return and we thank.
