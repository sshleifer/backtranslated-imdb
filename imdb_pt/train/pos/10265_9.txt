Exclusive movie about confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with sharp crooks. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-caliber performance as the smoothest of the group. Absolutely lovely first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse "the ropes" of her con games. The story falls apart a little later, but it is still a unique portrait of an innocent involved in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.
