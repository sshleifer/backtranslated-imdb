maybe I need to have my head examined, but I thought this was a good movie. The CG is not so bad. I've seen the worst. The look of the creatures (and creatures I mean the good snake and the bad snake) was The action scenes that involved the snakes were very good, I thought. There are some lapses in logic sometimes, and history does not always make sense. But for a creature characteristic, there is much worse. the other creatures seemed to be taken from other films, so it's not entirely original. I think the essence of the story is original, although there is a bit of a resemblance to Godzilla (the American version of Big budget) that I liked very much. like this movie, but I still say it was very good. I also liked the song. In the end, I think Dragon Wars has 7/10.
