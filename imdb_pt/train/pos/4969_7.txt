It is wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exerting international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with THE ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the idle class identity above work, but far below the middle, the unbalanced parent, the abandoned urban milieu, the sense of adult failure, the ill-concealed fascism that underpins modern urban life. But if Meadows is an experienced formalist, Mariage commercializes images, and his coldly composed, surreally perfect monochrome frames serve to distance the somber, half-shadowy subject that, like Meadows, turns from farce to tragedy in seconds. There are longueurs and cliches, but Poelvoorde is incredibly mad, an ordinary man with common ambitions, whose attempts at accomplishing them are dangerous; while individual pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best wedding sequence since THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY - manage to snatch the epiphany of despair.
