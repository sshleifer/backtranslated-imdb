The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. It was extremely funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet. Parents are hilarious. They are vendors as well as enemies. The children play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart. I hope after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and the contamination of classical literature, do not watch. If you do not mind those you will get a blast watching this.
