What's the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I just came straight from watching this movie, and the images are still burned in my brain - and I do not think they will be moving anytime soon. <br /> <br /> It is probably fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea of ​​what kind of film this is, even if you have not seen it. If not, let me warn you that this is not a moderate budget gem that has been lost for a few years to the "Near Dark", nor is it a low budget, schlocky B "fun" movie. What is low budget art, presented in a simple yet poignant way. The idea is simple: seven stories that involve and end in suicides interspersed with images of decaying corpses. Sounds simple, even annoying? It is not. Words can not really describe how powerful this movie becomes when you're halfway; it pretty much draws you there, whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could go on a ramble here on the pros and cons of the steering; you may want to point out that the scenes are obviously recorded on super-8 cameras and are sometimes unstable. I could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in order to rival any Fulci movie, but at the end of the day everything seems to pale in insignificance. <br /> <br /> As extreme films, I saw the most difficult of them, and yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few succeeded in spite of not being particularly bloody and having very few scenes that I would consider "free" . In fact, the most disturbing scene I encountered was the last story. I'm not going to ruin everything, just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually escapes the screen and makes you sympathize, if I do not yearn for the end of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not the best movie ever, and in many places it looks kind of gross and maybe a bit amateurish, but despite these flaws, Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who He likes challenging movies. If you're someone who likes to watch with comfort or "cool" movies, or you just want to fight over something brutal and meaningless, that's not what you're after. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, it's one that you will not forget in a hurry.
