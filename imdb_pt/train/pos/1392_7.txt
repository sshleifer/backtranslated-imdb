Bizarre, trippy, forget-over-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low-budget sci-fi on the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witnesses to a series of events that increase in their level of strangeness; apparently, they were caught in a space-time deformation where past, present and future collide. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a parade of highly entertaining special effects - a constant show of light and sound, dinosaur-like creatures that have each other, a friendly and small little ET who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. This photo shows a little imagination, if nothing else. Richard Band's very cool music, involving special effects from David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran, and importantly A nice family is a key asset. This creates a sense of childish wonder; may well be more of a joke to children (or children within many of us) who are able to cover up any flaws in narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to resist. ; is a short, sweet diversion (80 minutes) and a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (of the "Kingdom of the Spiders") and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
