This is the first review I wrote for IMDb so naked with me, but I got this movie on HBO and was happy to watch it. Richard Gere is great in this movie as the passionate agent / detective who doubles the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great, and there's never a dull scene that slows down the movie. Some parts of the movie that have to do with insane sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to handle the scenes. <br /> <br /> So overall, if you're looking for a good suspense / detective movie, ignore the low ratings this movie has about IMDb and definitely watch.
