This movie is an eye opener for those who can just the glamorous lifestyle of the stars. It tells you how people who would like to do good are not capable. Plus the bomb blast scene is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and is taught just does not happen !!! <br /> <br /> You can increase your BP level by 10% <br /> All the actors played their part very well. Some scenes could / could have been avoided to include teenagers. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite adult in nature. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that can be seen with the family. <br /> <br /> Casting is great !!!
