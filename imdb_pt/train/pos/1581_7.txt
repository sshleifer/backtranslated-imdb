Goebbels' motivation to retreat was not explored. In the aftermath of Stalingrad, the Reich decided to opt for "total war". This is referred to in the film. Part of it was to use women in the war effort, which Germany had not done in the past. A massacre of SS women would have faced Goebbels with a major public relations disaster. His preference was to make the problem disappear as quietly as possible, based on the fact that Jewish men could always be reunited later. I understand that most survived the war. <br /> <br /> Her other problem was that Red Berlin was never really enthusiastic behind the Nazi cause and had to be treated with caution. Again, a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis the mediocre level of support they had in their capital. It was interesting that most SS uniforms showed patches indicating that men did not wear them. of German nationality, but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
