Scanners II: The New Order is as good as the classic Scanners, by David Cronenberg, Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, so it's an eleven year gap between the two films. The film captures the style of the Scanners, which is fine, it would not be Scanners without a head blast, so the Scanners II has a blast scene in the head that's awful as the first. Scanners II: The New Order has some other imaginary scenes that are well made. The plot for Scanners II: The New Order is a new version of the series, as the Scanners are being used as a surveillance force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named David Kellum discovers that is being used and decides to avenge itself. Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's classic science fiction Scanners and must be seen. Look this. 10/10
