Fortunately for us fans of Real McCoy (probably all the Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 1950s and 1960s), three of the adult actors / actresses appeared when they performed the show in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died a little after. As amusing as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Cucumber together again, was it equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? It is my understanding that Little Luke passed away in 1999, but I do not know how. There is no information about Hassie on the internet that I can find. Very curious because they were not even mentioned? It was so evident, his absence at the Reunion show, that I suspect Michael's family and Lydia (if still alive), 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and therefore his wish was granted, or 2) The TNN could not find any trace of Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the retrospective on Walter Brennen was wonderfully done. They did nothing about it ... it was grandpa who did the show as a hit. I remember, as a child, imitating the grandfather's walk and my parents laughing (as I'm sure millions of other children did at that time). An annoyance that bothered me a bit, was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed quite capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and talk too much during the Reunion show. Wretch, since I wanted to hear from all three, equally. All in all, the Show Reunion was a real treat for me. I've watched it on DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
