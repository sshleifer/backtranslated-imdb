Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we like it, but we do not love it as we love "A special day". I believe that Ettore Scola is greatly underestimated: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because his most recent films were disappointing. And so, last night, my mother and I sat on the couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, directing, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but what I liked best was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Both are excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fascist fanatic, has six children, but the husband wants to have another child to win a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an antifascist. They spend together a special day, that special day of 1938, when Hitler went to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to ruin the plot anymore: look for this movie!
