Assuming roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play some vaudeville comics of the day, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale that seem to take a different view of life. Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man never learned to relax, take time and smell the roses. He is a grumpy old man whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is finding less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What seriously hurt him is that about 15 years before his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can not understand this and personally take the decision of Burns. <br /> <br /> Benjamin strikes a brain storm, gather the guys and do it on a national television special. What happens here is quite hilarious. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are also a sad and bittersweet story as well as about old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the film, but it is Burns who gained fame in the form of an Oscar at the ripe old age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought some of the staff to this movie as well. As we all know, he was the direct man of Burns & Allen's wonderful comedy team, which the Monty Python troupe borrowed heavily. In 1958, due to health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George continued going until the age of 100 years. Or at least very close to as an active artist. The Sunshine Boys is based on the Smith & Dale team, however, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I strongly recommend you watch Two Tickets to Broadway to take a look at two guys who were entertaining the American public at the turn of the last century. The sketch of the doctor Matthau and Burns do is directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll like the Sunshine Boys.
