This movie will not look good on some, but it's a must see. I'm glad someone has finally brought to the table the realities of how African-American couples worked to make a name in the communities and how many of them felt they were trying to stay there when "other" African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African-American man (Danny Glover) who worked hard at traditionally white 1970's professional law positions. Like ANY American, he changed his family to be compatible with his upward mobile status, but forgot, there were still many problems going on. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at the time were the maids. One owning a home? Wow. <br /> <br /> So the mix started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is advised to "get involved" in order for her to do what all the other women in her neighborhood do. And when the man thinks he and his family are "in", next door comes another African American who came in because he won the "lottery" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes and he does not want anything with them because he does not wants the neighborhood to think they look alike. He, of course, is of a better caliber, his new neighbor is "ghetto", not one should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the great pain that this family needs to fit in and how they get lost in the process. It makes you wonder where racism starts and ends ... and with whom. It shows how it does not matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still isolate yourself from the real world and help the people around you. It also shows how these African American children, when they mingle in neighborhoods like these, fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, remember!) Around them. They laugh along with the jokes, not knowing they are the joke and not knowing ... why. <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is about 'people'. No matter what race you are, this movie goes into how terrible you can be in relation to your neighbor and relative to the other ... everything to fit in ... all because you feel you have more money than others, so this automatically does is best - and you forget the struggles you had and the ones behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But take a look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
