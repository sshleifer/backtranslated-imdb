The planning episodes were a little boring, but when they arrived in the desert it was fun to watch. The reason I call the reality show more realistic is because, to my surprise, Charley left the race relatively early. When his hands were sore, I expected the usual stress and then a miraculous correction, but he really gave up the run. The most eager moment of the show must have been when Max was trapped in the desert with almost no water or food! The finale was great and I was really happy to see at least one team do that. Overall, it's not as good as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch as it glimpses the most challenging race in the world.
