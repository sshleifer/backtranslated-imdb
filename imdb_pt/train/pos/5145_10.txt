<br /> <br /> An old man works as a caretaker in a psychiatric hospital to be near his wife, who is a patient there and try to get her out of there. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and a strangeness in the history of Japanese cinema. Long lost thought, an impression was found in the 70's and a music soundtrack added to it, which fits perfectly with the images. It may have been influenced by Dr. Caligary's office (director Kinugasa said he never saw the German film). However, he overcomes it in style and in his more convincing (and cold) portrait of the inner mental state of asylum inmates. To achieve this, the film makes use of all the film techniques available at the moment: multiple exposures and subjective point of view out of focus, inclined camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and overlaps among others. It's also a very complicated movie to follow, as it has no subtitles. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a set of rain shots hitting the windows of the hospital, the wind shaking the trees and thunder. The metaphors of time disturbing the mental condition of patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that prompts the dancer to enter into a frenzied, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient involved in another frantic dance, she is being watched over by other inmates. Multiple exposures of the dancer represent patients' point of view and their confused "vision" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this incredible movie trying to represent the subconscious and the view of patients. "sane" world. <br /> <br /> In three words A MUST SEE.
