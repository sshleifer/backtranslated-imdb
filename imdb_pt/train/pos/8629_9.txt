I read a little ad in a horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes (The Love of the Dead) or something similar. This, of course, piqued my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 and 2 and Der Todesking (The King of Death). Nekromantik films are cool, even interesting and unique in their approach to the subject of Necrophilia (even though they are obviously horror opera introductions rather than invoking fear in the minds of viewers, they are actually very funny). > <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand, is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. It consists of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Death as enemy; Death as a reliever, Death as the very physical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces your viewers to the children they (we) really are. The fact that we can not really understand the nature of death and therefore, nor the dying process, is the central message of the film. This is a more realistic film. Buttgereit never tries to hide death behind white roses or anything else. No matter what moral standards you establish, death is inevitable and, sooner or later, it will not be a fiction, but HIS reality. This applies to you, dear reader, as it applies to movie viewers. Some juvenile reviewers do not seem to understand this, which is totally excused, since they will certainly live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploration film. Because? Because death does not exploit humans. Harvest us. We grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the Schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, which is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. Whether you choose to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic", you decide. At first glance, it may look very dark. Consider, however, that in order for something to live, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body, which is being consumed by worms, it shows not only the decomposition, but the GENERATION of a new life. Is not it better to die and give life to worms and birds and eventually become soil than to remain the undead zombie that is one of the favorite animals of its kind? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, you see Der Todesking in its right context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of the week (weak, deadly!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of the Grim Reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because the Reaper takes only what is ripe. And apples that are not plucked by food will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, IMDB mates! <br /> <br /> (And watch this movie, which only compares Ingemar Bergmans "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
