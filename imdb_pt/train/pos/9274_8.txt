Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of oppression of fundamentalist regimes, has no problem creating passionate themes. Panahi takes a different approach this time with a mixture of ironic comedy and a captivating and unprofessional cast. While still conveying his message of what he sees as inherently wrong with his country, he does so without the need for a heavy plot. It is a good thing that a country, in particular its people, desperately needs the Iranian population. The biggest shame is that it will not be released internally. The insular and paranoid Iranian government claims that this excellent filmmaker only succeeds overseas because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up in the midst of the revolution and watching academics, artists and educated 'disappeared' over the last 25 years, he shows great bravery as he continues to put his work out there. The realism achieved by firing on the actual World Cup qualifier really transports you to the event. The fact that he shot in 35mm is incredible, because most would only try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors also works in this film. Beautiful performances everywhere. After watching many films showing the problems that Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts, we can tend to demonize both the people and the government. This movie does the opposite. This shows us that they still love the same things and that, laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law, maybe a change for the better is not too far off. Some call it a feminist filmmaker Panahi, but I think it only fights for the most demoted oppressed in Iran. Young, independent women.
