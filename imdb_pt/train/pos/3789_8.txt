Bravo to the Czechs, the once powerful film industry seems to wake up from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy made up of all the elements you would expect to see in a modern Hollywood production minus the rubbish that seems to cling to the genre in recent years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful urban landscape of Prague, to mention just a few. <br /> <br /> History is actually composed of several sub-stories that often intersect and overlap, and is essentially a collage of destinies, fates, desires ... A group of urban youth from the ranging in age from 30 to 30 years, through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions. And it is hillarious. In fact, there is a point in the movie where the whole theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for about 40-50 seconds. How many times do you experience this with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the main cast is excellent (especially the Macedonian star, Labina Mitevska, in the role of an immigrant facing family difficulties), Jiri Machacek has to be highlighted for his superbly retractable Jakub, stoned whose brain is severely affected by the material he smokes plunges him into a plethora of funny situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not miss this! It has much to offer.
