I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies combined so that they were twice as good. K-9, K-911 and K-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team. The only downside is that I did not really understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said that I must have missed it. Other than that I give you two thumbs / crown! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have a lot of training. They were so funny and all the noises Jerry Lee did when Dooley talked to him was so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite particular people to get very, very funny information lol
