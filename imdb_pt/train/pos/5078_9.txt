This one stood out for its originality. I am seriously tired of watching Hindi movies that are a lot of Hollywood and British films. Some flaws were inevitable, however, this film is a must-see. Surya's picture of the conscientious and clean police (as opposed to the cash-hungry, cash-hungry people we normally see) was incredible. He has come a long way since his work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much I had to own it. I do not usually use the kind of senseless violence movies, somehow I really felt for each character and therefore I can not really call myself "stupid" violence. I do not appreciate the excess of melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most of the films in Hindi and Tamil. I just loved this movie for lack of it. The reaction of ACP Anbuselvan to losing his wife is not exaggerated, it is heart-breaking and makes me want to scream with my eyes out. There are certain times when I am watching a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in a movie theater. I never wanted to do that when I watched this movie. I'm really hoping that the Ghajini will be released soon.
