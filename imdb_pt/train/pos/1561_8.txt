I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (though all he did was swim) made my eyes widen. To see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to overthrow Lex Luthor is what I was hoping for. That sounds a bit off the topic, but doing a live Justice League show would definitely make me have a reason to push everything I usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode. That's the excitement I have to watch this episode. I wish they had made this episode a bit more like a two-hour special because I felt that an hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now, before I annoy you (unless I already have my rambling) I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. He kind of lost his touch when the show started focusing on Lana. But I'm sure the writers will fall back into that hole. :( So enjoy this episode.Who knows when another good one will come out.Get it again this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first display.
