1933 seemed like a great year for satires ("Duck Soup", for example) and this one fits well, although it's about the obsession with the contract bridge. The tone is like a humorous piece of The New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the page "Goings On About Town" of that magazine. The only strange thing is the cast. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you would not have had adultery treated in such a sophisticated way, young and beautiful Loretta Young in some stealthy furtive clothing, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on the radio. Even if you know nothing about bridge, you may still want to take a look at a rare example of Hollywood satire.
