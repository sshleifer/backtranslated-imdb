I first saw this for half a life on a black-and-white TV in a small village in Samoa and found it hilarious. Now, having seen it a second time, much later, I do not find it hilarious. I do not think anything more hilarious. But this is a witty and light comedy that moves quickly without stumbling and I liked it. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F who's dying to get into one of the military. He rubs a lamp on the junkyard he is administering and a genius seems to grant him some wishes. (Ho hum, right?) But although the introduction is no more than normal, the fantasies are very lively.) MacMurray tells the genius that he wants to be in the army. Poof, and he's marching along with the Washington soldiers for a particularly warm and inviting public service, where June Haver and Joan Leslie are wearing lots of lace or whatever, and lavender wigs. Washington orders MacMurray to spy on the enemy - the red-speaking, German-speaking Hessians, not the English. The Hessians are stuck in a Bierstube and sing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of Vaterland, "where the white wine is tastier / and the Rhinier of the Rhine" and the bratwurst is more mature / and the yellow hair is more yellowish / Frauleins are more jugier / and the steps of goose are thicker. "The characterizations are fabulous, as good as those of Sig Rumann Otto Preminger is the suspect and sinister general Hessian." You know, Heidelberg, vee they're 241 against 1 - but you're not afraid. "<br /> <br /> I can not go on with these fantasies for a long time, but they're all very funny, just like the letters.When he wanted to be in the Navy, MacMurray ends up with Columbus and the fantasy is presented as a great opera. "Do not you know that sailing west meant a terribly expensive investment? And who do you think provides the means / but Isabella, Queen of Queens? "When they see the New World, someone observes that it looks great." I do not care what it looks like, "mutters Columbus," but this place goes be called Columbusland. "<br /> <br /> Anyway, everything is finally straightened out, although the genius this time is rather drunk, and MacMurray ends up in the Marine Corps with the right girl. <br /> < The children will enjoy the puffs of smoke and magic and the tacky love story.The adults will have fun with the most challenging elements of the story (who are the Hessians ?), Unless they are newly formed, in which case they may want to stick with the legerdemain and say, "Wow! Amazing!"
