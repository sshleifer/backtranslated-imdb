That's how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show on reruns in 2001. <br /> <br /> I like the show, but it had many flaws. <br /> <br /> I hate the characters of Michael and Joe! <br /> <br /> Steal stories from old TV shows. They even stole from "The Partirdge Family". Then in 1 episode, "The Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors playing different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn most notably doing this, especially when she performed in 1 episode. Michelle's character MIGHT NOT take a joke but then they made this child act like "revenge" for her sisters a joke for them about her. <br /> <br /> Story lines that came and went in 1 episode. Joey doing the TV show with Frankie and Annette, never heard of it after that. Danny, suddenly playing the guitar. 1 episode he is training soccer, 1 episode he is training softball / baseball. 1 game and you're out huh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey continue to get jobs REALLY QUICKLY inexperienced. Only on a TV show. <br /> <br /> I liked the DJ. And characters Stephanie. I wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure and had a clean, drug-free adult life.
