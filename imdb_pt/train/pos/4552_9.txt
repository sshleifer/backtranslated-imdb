Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances of an actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who later learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays her loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is fantastic because young Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great as their father. Worth to watch for the exceptional performances.
