One of the unknown gems of the '80s, the Scenes ... features sharp satire and incredible performances by Arnetia Walker (how did she get a ton of paper after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a delightful dispatch of class warfare and the people in those classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters, although not subtle, are nuanced. And, sorry, but Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese from extorting one of the other "gang" characters) were not put as "sociological value" as another review indicates they should be. The value here is in what the movie is making fun of and the incredibly perverse way it does. I found it creative, funny and idiosyncratic.
