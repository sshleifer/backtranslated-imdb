I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I really liked the movie. Two days before the movie premiered, I went to see his show. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I had everything planned .. I was wrong: instead of a good movie I watched a great! I felt the movie. was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all portrayed LOVE .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so I'm not going :) I'm not a movie critic .. I can not describe it in more words .. My description half is vague because the game left me speechless .. thank God for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
