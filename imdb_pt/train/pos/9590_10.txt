The documentary begins in 1986 in New York, where drag queens black and Hispanic hold "balls." It's where they dress the way they like it, show off their stuff in front of an audience and get voted on. We meet many of the members and see how they all stand together and support each other. As one man says to another - "You have three attacks on you - you are black, gay, and a drag queen." They are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - just in the balls. There they can be who and what they want and be accepted. So the movie cuts to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> It looks depressing, but it's not. Most people interviewed are really very funny and take a lot of humor out of their situations. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - just as they should. We find that everyone lives in "houses" run by several "mothers" and they all help each other. The sense of community in this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a great success. He won the award for best documentary at numerous festivals - but was never nominated for an Oscar. The reason was "The black and Hispanic drag queens are not Academy materials." Fascinating is not it? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Seen today is still a great movie - and a play of the period. It simply is not so - the NY they show does not exist anymore. The balls are still safe, but not in the spirit we see here. Also dragging has become more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I heard the houses were gone, too. This is kind of sad. I'd like to know where these characters are now - I know two have died of AIDS, but I have no idea about the others. And what happened to that 13- and 15-year-old kid shown? <br /> <br /> Still, it's a unique documentary - fascinating, entertaining and fascinating. A must see all the way! A definitive 10. Where is the DVD ???
