I saw this movie for the first time during the course of International Film Studies. I am a "non-traditional" student and, for reasons of years of life or wisdom, I appreciated the slow and thoughtful rhythm of the film's narrative. Bored with the heat and the dust of an arid climate, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multilayered symbolism and an articulate reversal of the theme of being the "Other" in a land that is not understood. the coming understanding is replete with unresolved memories and subjectivity of the stranger. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also the forerunner in a genre of countless other international films that explore colonists' themes in colonized spaces, ignoring the nuances of the cultures in which they entered. Much more richly filmed - and highly funded - works that have been done since then reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that, by comparison, might make Chocolat look pale and boring. It has no adrenaline action or extreme violence. Fights are mental, emotional, and subtle. But, having said that, it's a great movie that deserves to be seen.
