after seeing this movie for the 3rd time now I think it's almost worse Adam PUNCH movie DRUNK LOVE is poor compared to this I must say that in the end when Dickie is played the boat is so funny (hair is different from the his and I like it when he gets everyone's attention. This movie should only be brought in if you are a fan of Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> The characters are poor compared to their funny movies like Waterboy, which has the same people (Peter Dante) who is one of the killers who try to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> This film has no depth and a decent plot and deserves to be among the 100
