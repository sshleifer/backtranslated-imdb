About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. I thought about giving up completely on television until a friend who lived in England showed me some programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. It was then that I decided to switch to British television. Among all the shows listed above, The League of Gentlemen is easily the most obscure and twisted of all, providing guilty laughter and material not found in any other comedy I have ever seen. The characters included are the most unhappy couple, a butcher who puts ingredients in the meat that are not said (probably for the better), a troubled couple looking at a local shop that serves only local people, and the worst veterinarian of all time . This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
