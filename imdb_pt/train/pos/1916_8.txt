"8 SIMPLE RULES ... TO DATE MY ADOLESCENT DAUGHTER", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I have not seen all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an accident occurred. I always laughed at that. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the program more when John Ritter was the protagonist. If you ask me, your sudden passage was very tragic. Everyone always performed well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network will bring it back to the air for program fans to see.
