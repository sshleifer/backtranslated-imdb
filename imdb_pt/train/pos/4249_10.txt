If there are three guys in their tight whiteys pounding on a guy tied in string or a girl saying "Hey, dog?" for a lot of running over, there is something to please everyone at Knuckleface Jones. It's strange and surreal and not totally a completely understandable thread ... but it never misses you. The first time I saw it, I almost laughed at myself sick. And every night afterward I would go home and watch again. Forget Ugly Coyote ... this is the movie that cemented my passion for Piper Perabo. See ... before it's too late!
