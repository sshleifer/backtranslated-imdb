I think this is possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just check out the "Quotes" section; thinking twice, just rent the DVD, since it is the delivery that really makes the lines sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives a comical and exaggerated performance like you've never seen her anywhere else and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot as the besieged client. I've never been much of a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as the * real * person surrounded by a bunch of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun Also Sets" - that snore you feel underneath you is Hemingway rolling in his grave. Either that, or he's laughing a lot. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
