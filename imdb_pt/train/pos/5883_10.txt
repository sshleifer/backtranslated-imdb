I watched, hypnotized and hypnotized, by vocal and physical performance. The roles each character played were made with excellence. The letters, the words, all the gestures, the sunrise, told everything. The movie was talking to me. This enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and kind behavior. I was also held in disbelief by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. Power without grace, is demented and without feelings. Desiring power at the expense of humanity is so unbelievable. This movie left me so afraid of people who are no longer in this world. And it is with sadness that I think of them. I like this movie for the conversations and facial expressions for all of this. May this film be blessed.
