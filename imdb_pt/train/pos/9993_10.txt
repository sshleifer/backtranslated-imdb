The most hillarious and funny Brooks movie I have ever seen. I can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times. I laugh and cry in a few moments. It's a very good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billions of euros) comes to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to conquer the entire poor district of its competitor. Reality bites, but in the end - these are warm relationships between humans ... I recommend it!
