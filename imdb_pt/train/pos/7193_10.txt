God! Zorro has been the subject of as many films as Tarzan, and probably had the same number of actors in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This Serial is one of my personal favorites, and as mentioned earlier, is one of the Top 5 Sound Serials. Curiously, this is a production that came out in that year of 1939. * At the time of this production, in 1939, Zorro was well-known like literary and cinematographic personage (Pulp). The film opens with a small note on the history of Mexico's struggle for freedom of government by a European monarchy, namely Spain. History invites comparison with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its 'Council'. He is being approached by Benito Juarez ** in the relationship of his gold mine with the new Republic of Mexico. Shipments of gold should be shipped to Mexico City. Don Francisco Tio to Diego Vega claims that he organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the golden convoys. A thug of the Don del Oro mob makes an "insult" to himself and challenges Don Francisco for a duel with swords, with Don Frasncisco running. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the black mask swordsman appears to fight with swords and after sculpt the mark. Z 'in the face of the villain, he dispatches it into the future. Don Francisco declares with his agonizing breath to his ward Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew of the city of Los Angeles. He also tries to speak of the true identity of Don del Oro, but expires before completing the statement. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception for Diego at the Don Francisco Farm, where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister (also the ward of Don Francisco) with his shy act. "FOP !!", she says. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon flee to a meeting with the volunteers. When they ask, "Who is going to take us with Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon declares "Zorro, we are the Zorro Fighting Legion!" Well, there is a great battle with the Legion, now all dressed in gray, with masks and cloaks, shielding the Gold Train. So Zorro seems trapped in a man-made avalanche to the train, when, well, you know the end of chapter one. <br /> <br /> Wow! This was very written for a chapter, but like most other serials, the opening is longer and has plenty of room to establish the story line. Let's just let it be enough to say that there are another 11 action-packed chapters, well done, below. <br /> <br /> THE ZORRO COMBAT LEGEND has all the elements that contributed to the most risky action. We have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting problems between different groups. There are several suspects about who really was behind the mask of "Don del Oro". We had soldiers, renegade whites, hostile Indians, and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In short, it is safe to say that there is everything one can want, and then some, in this Serial. And, by the way, they wisely chose not to have the actors affect any Mexican accent. <br /> <br /> What is it about here that makes ZFL stand out from the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ Firstly, it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on screen. The opening theme still appears on a flamenco guitar version in the Cantina in chapter one. This is probably the only time such a highly specialized innovation appears on the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And there is yet another feature that really puts the Fighting Legion saga ahead of all the others. That is, the film has not only a heroic musical theme, but also has sports lyrics, yes, the Legionaries sing! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It really works well and increases the feelings we get from the exhibit. <br /> <br /> When the Serial was first shown on our local television (around 1955), the whole gang immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley. owned by Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the TV series. Mr. Hadley had a very distinct and profound voice. *** He also handled the role very well. His suit and especially the elongated mask looked very good and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a slight slip. A minor sort of anachronism occurs with Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) addressing the Council of San Mendelito, since Juarez was 18 at that time (1824), and although he was later perhaps the greatest figure in Mexican history, he certainly had not achieved such prominence yet. His inclusion in the story probably went to make money with the release of Warner Brothers' JUAREZ that year, starring Paul Muni in the title role. <br /> <br /> This is not only my choice as a series of 5 best sounds, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of the great crop of first-rate movies that year, with GONE WITH THE WIND, MR.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE ASSISTANT OF OZ, MICE AND MEN, A MILLION OF AC, ZENOBIA, WE WANT OUR MOMMY, all counted among the production of that year. <br /> <br /> ** Again, Juarez did not rise to any national importance until 1850, some 25 years later. In addition, political subdivisions are referred to as 'Provinces' in history. In fact, they are called "States". Just as we are called the United States of America, also South of the Border they call their Repubhlic of the United States of Mexico. Reed Hadley was prominent in some very 'A' photos in which his richly toned voice is explored with good results. See and hear his narration in THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
