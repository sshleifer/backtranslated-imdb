1936 was the most prolific year of Astaire and Rogers. Is your second RKO movie that year the third movie in this collection? "Follow the Fleet" by Mark Sandrich. This time Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a licensed sailor who happens to stumble into the seedy seaside cafe where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is talking romantic and sweet things in everyone's ear. Yes, you guessed it? they are hot to each other one more time. But this time Sherry's single sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard), threatens all the good romance by falling in love with Bake's rugged maritime friend, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use and kind of guy, forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion on all the sailors in general. Irving Berlin lends class immeasurable to the process with his classic and classic track, including the 'Let Yourself Go' standards, 'I'm putting all my eggs in a basket' and 'Let's face music and dance'. the latter, a divinely inspired tale about suicide, which turns into another step of passion immediately recognizable and utterly sublime to Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer to 'Follow The Fleet' is a bit weaker. The gray scale remains well balanced, but is now a bit thick, with variation not as tenuous as the previous titles. The grain is still present. So are the artifacts related to age. Once the image quality is slightly dense and sometimes softer, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage. The audio is Mono but very well balanced. Extras include a featurette, theatrical trailer and short subject, but strangely? no audio commentary. Considering the importance of this film in the general canon of Astaire / Rogers, this is an atypical view of Warner Home Video.
