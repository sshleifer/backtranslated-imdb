Not having seen this movie in about 20 years, I'm still impressed by its impact and its stellar performance. Of course, a Mr. Mickey Rooney is indeed AMAZING in his role as the "Killer" (in reference to another review here - none other than Orson Welles evoked the name of Mickey Rooney as the greatest movie actor, too). I also remember the jazz soundtrack and black and white photography. I love Mick's last sentence before he leaves for his dose of lead poisoning (I think the Stranglers have raised him to a line in one of his songs - Get a Grip on Yourself.) This is a great movie and movie unfairly buried Let's go out! Side Note - A recent Review Film Review gave a great commentary on Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson," a few years before "Last Mile" and also starring Mickey Rooney. Another rave of Mick's intense and endearing performance. It may be the beginning of a wave of appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances.
