***** Spoilers here ***** What really scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a psychopath wielding a chainsaw? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears do not even compare to a horror that people neither dare to speak or consider - and this is the death of their own child. "Pet Sematary" explores this base, the primordial fear of adults, and then takes it to places that most could not afford to explore. <br /> <br /> I read comments about this movie that include bad acting, characters making nonsense decisions, etc. I disagree. The acting is really the first rate for a movie like this. It may be impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the events in the film are not only logical, they can be absolutely unavoidable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of "Pet Sematary": it is not that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, is that anyone who has lost a child can become so desperate to the point of committing the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite the warning, or even of past history. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who are willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector trying to compensate for not being able to protect. And the results are horrifying. In fact, when the movie plunges into slasher territory near the end, it is almost a disappointment, though I believe it is perfectly logical how it got there. <br /> <br /> I'm a true horror fan, and I claim that this is one of the scariest horror films ever. If you do not think so, see him again after having children.
