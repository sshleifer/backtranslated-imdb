This is the work of Neil Simon who received lots of praise! "The Odd Couple" is a type of jewel that stays inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, stuck the freak and a big thorn next to his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total slob. These men have great jobs though. Felix is ​​a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, while Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living together in one roof without being driven mad, are impossible and unlikely. It's a lot of laughs and lots of fun. I liked the part where when those two British neighbors who talk to the two lords, and after Oscar expel Felix, he is lucky and lives with them when he refused to dine with them the night before. It was time for Felix to calm down. I think all the quirks neat to illuminate. They can be demanding, but they should be patient as well. A very fun movie and a new classic. "The Odd Couple" by Neil Simon is a must-see classic film. 5 STARS!
