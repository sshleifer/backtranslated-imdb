Every once in a while a movie advertises itself as scary or scary, though usually they are not. Most modern horror movies fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those movies that simply do not cause the tension and adrenaline in your veins, more than normal. They really scare you to a level you've never experienced. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is one of those films. There are many risks that make most movie producers shrink. But almost everyone works. "Halloween" is inspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a whole. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some children on Halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, starts killing the local teen population and eventually he comes after Laurie. It looks familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher full of idiot teens and blood bubbles. Not a chance. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of "Halloween:" "Because of its title, Halloween has often been clustered with all the other splatter films that populated theaters over the course of the years 1970s and early 1980s. However, while Halloween is considered the father of the modern slasher genre, he is not a member ... "He is right, and for a number of reasons. Firstly, it's absolutely terrifying, while most of the entries for the teen slasher genre are hoaxers (arguably many recent ones are ironic, but most also fail). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very little of what is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not so scary, and he relies very little on it (in fact, body count is very low). In fact, it can be argued that this is not really a horror movie, at least not by the current standards of having the highest death tolls that can be squeezed into a single movie, each one more sadistic and more sadistic than the previous one . He trusts ideas for scares and also ability. Third, while some characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they do not because they are stupid. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that characters die because they're idiots, we're scared because they're making a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why Halloween is so scary is because it's so easy to believe it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this movie. There is no supernatural, no ridiculously creative plot elements, or "inventive" murders, or something. Instead, all set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just puts the camera in place and says action. What we have is the feeling that we are actually seeing a murder happen right in front of us. Horror movies are probably the hardest movies to do because, in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It is a success or a failure, and that is why, if I say all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I am not), they would seem primitive (especially because they have been repeated with less effect over and over again over the years. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic and conflicted characters. <br /> <br /> Actors act like real people, not characters in a story. The exception to this is The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers.It may be scary to have a person who does not say anything and simply mate, but it is hard to get (and even harder to stop people from asking why ) But the guy does it, and the result is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's end-to-end movie. <br /> <br /> He directed, co-wrote, co-produced and wrote the scary track. This is a man of brilliance, and his later film "The Thing "supports this claim, although The Thing is not as scary as" Halloween. " Unfortunately, its success has drastically diminished, as when attracting large sums for less freedom is harnessed when large producers "recognize their potential." As good as this movie is, it's not flawless. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not too scary. And not many of the scares work in the first part of the movie. It's not that bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear "The Shape". Fortunately, Carpenter primarily uses this time to establish a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there is no intimacy in this relationship, it fits into purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the movie arrives on Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks in and NEVER stops until it comes to an end. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" may have flaws, it's just a little bit. It is an immensely terrifying and must-see movie for people who like horror movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the hell out of you!
