Cusack does his best David Niven on this, although I do not know if anyone other than me has realized it. When viewed with that in mind, it's a deliciously saturated 'want to be taken more seriously than Austin's powers, but it would still be very funny to rework an unappreciated comedy classic. Hillary Duff makes a super sexualized version of Britney who releases a version of Mata Bond. The writers built a bit of inverted Oedipus on the plot - an interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I never knew how Montel's voice was comforting until this movie ... I think he found a new vocalization doing nav system voice overs!
