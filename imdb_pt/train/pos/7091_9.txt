The big problem is where to start, since this movie needs your attention in the next two hours and it is best not to waste a few minutes to get a coke as there is a danger that you can not follow. But hey, there's also a pause button. Bruce Willis must travel to a time machine to discover some antivirus for a virus that made the animals dominate the world in 1996. Thanks to some errors, it ends in 1990, then in World War I and how it all looks like Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the smartest scripts of all time. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how SF's cool stories have to be told and his choice of cast could not have been better, there's the lunatic Brad Pitt (his asylum performance is memorable) and a great Bruce. Willis, who proves that he is more than some Schwarzenegger. It's a movie that you can watch again and again, because the script is so strange and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every vision gives you other surprises. One of my big favorites.
