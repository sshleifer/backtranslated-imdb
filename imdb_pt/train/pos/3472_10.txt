Very Light Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (despite being only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I did not really pay attention to differences in appearance or accent, so I really can not comment on that. The acting on it was so good that I had to pinch myself and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, it DOES NOT REALLY HAPPEN." As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talking, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about if they really had that date. John's impromptu comments and burns were right with his character (especially in the restaurant!), As was his depression while Paul was very quiet and relaxed. Both actors did great work and I was thrilled to have seen this movie. It's a bad experience for any Beatles fan. And get ready for some surprises!
