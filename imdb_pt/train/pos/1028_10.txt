I have to say from the beginning when I watched the Stargate movie I was not surprised or anything that was like an ordinary science fiction movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL although the film was not as, erm, awesome as others sci fi movies like Star Wars or aliens, that if you're a science fiction fanatic, you'll admit that one of these two titles is incredible, even though I'm not as fan of science fiction as some people, I do not know. remember a line from any of these movies, I'm not a big fan of wearing Star Wars shirts, in fact, if you saw me I'd be an ordinary person for you, ah getting a little out of the way here, well my point is that you do not have to be a science fiction fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons, with no drop in quality as it neared its end in 2006. <br />> <br /> Although I did not really like the movie, I was looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were just one of the illogical things about the series, the chemistry between the characters pushed me away from the effects were as good, if not better, than most of the science fiction shows that are taking place today. I have to admit that I would never have gone to Sci fi if it was not for stargate, and my dad, who actually put me on the sci fi when I was 6, and I'm glad he did it, the other way around I wish I did not see the brilliant shows like SG1, which now in my opinion establishes the reference for almost all series of science fiction and films, basically if a new science fiction series is not better or as good as SG1, not worth worth watching. basically this is the best science fiction show to date, and if you do not watch then you have no idea what you're missing out on!
