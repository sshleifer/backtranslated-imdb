I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was a great story and showed that people are so complex in all sorts of different ways. I have already recommended it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good story and this movie had one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things Natalie did to find out more about her life and love. It showed how we not only have lives with our families; but we also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them - for it may not be in their interest to know all the details of the things we do not do that we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to another movie, and I'll keep my eye out.
