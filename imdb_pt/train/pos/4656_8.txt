An intelligent, undeniably entertaining joke starring Peter Ustinov as a career fraudster, aimed at an American conglomerate in London. He is encouraged by foxy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened by the exposure of the jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is an assault movie with lots of brains. Ustinov is exceptional just as Smith and Newhart are pretty funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, as the popping pill "executive vice president". Malden has rarely been so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some funny appearances. The great soundtrack is Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Till is fast and the script of Ustinov and Ira Wallach is of first line and very intelligent. A good time swaying!
