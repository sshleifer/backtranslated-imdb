If you like plot, this is your movie. It is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems or ends as you think it will. The characters are all brave and engaging. Cage is at his best. Dennis Hopper again shows off his deliciously sinister side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle chia. Dwight Yoakum makes a superb film premiere on a special turnout. I categorize this movie as "I'm having a really bad day". It's not a slow minute in this movie. A real sleeper. This movie is underestimated and, unfortunately, overlooked.
