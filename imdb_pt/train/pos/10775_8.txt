Good film with a great soundtrack that stretches across the rocky landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (Ligabue's hometown, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film ), describes the lives of young people and their problems with the world. Remember Trainspotting, with a little Italian touch.
