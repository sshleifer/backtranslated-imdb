I must admit that, outside the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, this has to be what I love the most, as well as another that I have also reviewed. History is something that really keeps you watching. Many of the EROS films have a plot that looks like a broken hammer into pieces before production when you watch it. All centered around sex, and who can come up with how many different people come to the end of the movie. And, my God, never watch one of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It does not work which is almost laughable, but you do not want to waste energy to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing Control" is exactly how your name appears. The protagonist, the protagonist (the wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control a person has over their senses, their body and their feelings. And a man changes everything for her, makes her a different woman almost. But the mirror is broken at the same time. This makes a great movie that I wish I had done first !! <br /> <br />
