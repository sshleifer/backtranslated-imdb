This was one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car in 1968. A moribund sentenced in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. His case is reopened with the presumption that he has been corrupted as a police officer. <br /> <br /> Further investigations into him as a police officer and a human being reveal a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This kind of love was considered shameful and something, at least, to keep hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of love that I personally support, he was still a cop and a human being and should not have been killed by it. The soundtrack was excellent (keeps me looking at the DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with colors to emphasize an object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing. I'll be watching this on repeat!
