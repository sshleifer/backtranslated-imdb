Those of the "Instant Gratification" era of horror movies will no doubt claim the rhythm of the film, the lack of free effects and body count. The fact is that "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. <br /> <br /> If you avoid the indie shelves because you're tired of annoying teenagers or twenty-something being killed by some villain whose background story might have come from the back of Count Chocula's box, The Acre Empty "is the movie for you. Set in the decadent remains of the rural American dream, "The Empty Acre" is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. As the couple's weak relationship falls apart, a larger story unfolds in the background. At night, a dark, telltale mass sprouts from an arid sun on her farm and apparently devours anything in its path, leaving no sign that it has ever been there. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues about what's going on, and ends with a well-executed ending that resonates with only questions left to validate the writer's / director's faith in an intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a subtext on the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the film allegory. Riveting, well acted and technically astute, "The Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that horror fans should love.
