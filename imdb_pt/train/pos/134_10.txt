Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its sacred place as one of the greatest films of all time in ten or twenty years when film critics and historians recall the so-called movies of the '90s and see how insipid they were to the greatest part, and how Lars von Trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the world of international cinema with this masterpiece. As it stands, "Zentropa" (or "Europe" as it is referred outside the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic visions of the almost psychotic desolation and uncertainty that emanated from post-World War II Europe, namely the decimated German landscape. , whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of his people. Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on the screen. You'll feel like you're watching some late 1940s spy noir classic with perfectly lit black-and-white scenes, while at the same time feeling you're on the verge of something beyond the front line, especially in scenes like murder on board the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier was caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this. And while his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classic in themselves, it's with "Zentropa" that he really elevated the art of making movies to new and exciting heights. 10/10, age like a good wine, and asks for a DVD release.
