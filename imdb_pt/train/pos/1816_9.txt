Many comments on this page mention that this film is a little dark for children. That depends on the kid. This is not a movie for children from 2 to 6 years old; is more geared towards the crowd of 8 years and older. I saw this movie when I was 10, I just loved it. At the time, most animated films were a bit too childish for my taste. This movie deals with more serious problems and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this movie characters can die, and be sent to hell! This gives a bit more emotional weight to the scenes where the characters are risking their lives. The good guys are not always perfectly sweet and gentle (like other cartoons). They have "real" motives, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent Movie
