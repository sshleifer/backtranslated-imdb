I read more than 100 of Nancy Drew's books, and if you're not bright enough to pick up yet, Nancy Drew, the movie was from a young Nancy Drew, not the 18 year old who does not go to school that all of the books are about. That was when she was sixteen. So, of course, she would not have been as smart as the book, considering she's only in 10th grade. Other than that, I found the film very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate, of character and cute. I liked the embarrassment that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. It was a cute, generic movie that I really enjoyed because I, unlike most people my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs or profanity.
