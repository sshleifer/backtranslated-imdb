A fairy story of a Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be pretty bad on Mars.) Two state cops investigate the scene of a UFO crash. Whatever has been buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond, but there are footsteps in the snow that lead to a nearby restaurant. <br /> <br /> The restaurant has no clients since eleven o'clock in the morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers seated waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists six passengers were aboard the bus, although he did not realize who they were. The problem is that now there are seven people waiting for the journey to resume. One of them is an alien, but which one? They are all suspects. There's the old crazy (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub pink wit. There is a businessman who must go to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Executable execution of her husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for the couples, no one noticed anyone else. And even the couples suspect each other. Bride to newly formed husband: "I could have sworn you had a mole on the chin." The story continues in a cheerful but a little frightening way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights come on and off, the juke box comes on - and none of this should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble piece and the revelation of the climax is worth a laugh. There is no discernible "depth" to it. It is not a moral message about people masquerading as ordinary citizens. It is not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that amuses and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always like it when it's turned on. It is especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman senator who planned the assassination of Julius Caesar in the version of MGM's Shakespeare play. And here he is - with three arms. <br /> Oops.
