This is one of my favorite martial arts films from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's earliest films and one of the few martial arts films he directed. You can see his influences of working with Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, the fight's choreography is led by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the film's bad guys. It stars in Wei Pei's fame of "Five Poisons" and a series of faces familiar to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions. The plot is interesting, there are some decent twists and the development of the characters and their relationships with each other is done in an intelligent way. This film had only one VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a regional DVD 3 and there are DVD versions available in the USA. The film is lovely to see in the original language or in the English-dubbed version. I recommend this movie.
