Monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the life force of the virgins, and her youngest target is the beautiful but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to scratching cats ... I've never been fan of despicable bestsellers like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Mr. Dung himself, is actually not as bad as it could be. Yes, sometimes it's jaw-dropping, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old graveyard, mysterious soundtrack and scene of gothic houses by candlelight, mirror showing the monstrous form of villains, etc. the film is polluted by Dung's foul-mouthed dialogue and by his obsession with all toilet tactics to defame fat people, leading to a professor subplot of totally meaningless rapes, but there are roses between manure.
