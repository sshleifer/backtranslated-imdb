A big surprise, probably because I expected it to be a drug. The reviews were very inconsiderate, although everyone seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man discovers that his new girlfriend is a superhero and discovers, when he wants to break up with her, that she's kind of a psychopath. I kept hoping it would crumble, but it never happened. Of course, he does not make the most of his incredible premise and chooses to be short when it might be better to expand the universe of the movie. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar super-hero G-Girl. And I discovered, after several years of disliking him, that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub. He gave two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in almost unpublished Idiocracy). I absolutely cracked the expressions on his face when he and Thurman had sex for the first time. It's one of the funniest sex scenes of all time. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little psychotic, almost unbelievably. Maybe with some experience I could have accepted better. I can forgive your failures, because I had so much fun watching. Understated, for sure.
