Lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful TV series ever made ... and so it is ... if you are mistress of mysteries, intrigues and adventures, this is the series for you ... In the first season. .. from the first episode begins to go more and more forward until reaching the second season ... in the second you lose a little your cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes a lot and reveals the various mysteries that the island hides .. the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because it has begun to suffer from the first episode with the rhythm and tenacity of the first season ... the fourth also does not let go unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries ... but not as the second season but in a little different ... For the fifth season awaits ...
