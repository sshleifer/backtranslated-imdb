This episode introduced the Holodeck in the world of TNG. Jarada has to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would be very insulting to them. A tired Picard decides to take a trip to the Holodeck and begins a wonderful adventure. The settings are excellent and almost like film. Unfortunately, the Jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all of its safety devices stop working. Picard and now the guests are expected to foil the mobsters of America from the 40 nodes and return to the encounter with Jarada. Picard greets Jarada correctly and a new day dawns between Humanity and Jarada. This gem of an episode of the first season set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to have there
