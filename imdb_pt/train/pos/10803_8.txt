I do not understand Not being critical, I'm not evaluating the quality of acting, which I think is believable, a good thing. My confusion is in the content. There is no one more sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their unfaithfulness to the men who were fighting and bleeding to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their country. Should not there have been a prologue informing us if the men came home, and if so, what effect did the infidelity of their "wives" have on them? While these women were taking care of their parents from a sense of loneliness, did they think their husbands were enjoying being shot while facing death or break up daily? They did not think of their husbands! Only of themselves. Forgive me, except when they wish their husbands were dead.
