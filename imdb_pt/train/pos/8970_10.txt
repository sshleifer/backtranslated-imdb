I researched this movie a bit and discovered a site that states that it was actually an internal joke about the post-WWII gay and lesbian world. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, witches and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the play, was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in fifth or sixth grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me into a movie that did not include horses, machine guns or alien monsters and I planned to get bored. But I remember when Jimmy Stewart hugged Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and threw his hat away as the camera followed him floating on the floor. As George Duning's glorious love theme rose, I suddenly realized what it was like to fall in love. The first awakening of romantic / sexual love left me stunned when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only preteen boy who has been seduced by Kim Novak's startling and direct gaze. It is ironic that a gay parable has been able to propel heterosexual puberty in many of us. I'm in my late 50's now and re-watched the movie last night and the same feelings shook as I watched the touch of the hat down fifty years later. . .
