Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any other Hayao Miyazaki movie, brings the joy of telling stories to the public. It's the kind of movie that makes someone feel like a kid again; it's just magical. It's a crime that took so long to get launched in the states, but now that you're here, check it out! And keep the original language; dub has changed my impressions about the characters a bit, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever). <br /> <br /> I give a ten / ten.
