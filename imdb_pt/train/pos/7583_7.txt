The final chapter of the Hanzo the Razor trilogy offers a perfect fit for this fun series of samuraploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu being the producer in addition to the titular anti-hero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers a female ghost holding a hidden treasure at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he is not put off by the fact that she is a ghost, so he begins to rape ... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar swivel device. The plot leads through a series of blind monks who also double as loans, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and hack. Hanzo's top officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comic notes and, in general, are the usual business. <br /> <br /> Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere and a bit of a mess), less elegant, dramatic and bloody than the second (undoubtedly the best of the series Hanzo), but still fun and worth it on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fights and a mystery that Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.
