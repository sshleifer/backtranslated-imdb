I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's face it; the premise does not sound particularly appealing when one has to hand over money for an evening movie, but has a relaxed nature that wins one. There were no moments that I found noisy, and I doubt anything I'll remember the next day, but this does not fail as good fun. What I found funny was watching here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like. I told her there was a plot - three guys had to bring back some weeds back to London. Hardly satisfying for her. There is no assault going on here for the camera that I was expecting after reading a number of comments. I make exception, however, to comparisons with Withnail and myself; not in the same league, and I doubt it was intentional. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
