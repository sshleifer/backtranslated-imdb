Nice movie though I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it. It's a mystery in the middle of the movie to know why Elly is so reclusive. So, when we finally get an explanation about his childhood, there are still not many details. Maybe they had flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's still a good movie that I watched again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
