I usually love these types of Charlie / 1930 films about mystery / police, and this is no exception. However, something looks bad with this movie. A late attempt to swap Moto's brainwaves was centered on de plans for de conspiracy for a salad bar spoofed by comedy relief dat is as rewiebwe as sore feet. A typography jester appears out of nowhere representing a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled in providing comedy relief. The plot may seem strange or a bare excuse to us today, but at that time the possibility of archaeological epochs was not only real, but a common occurrence.
