Some people say that this is the best movie the PRC has ever released, I'm not really sure about it since I have a place of love in my heart for some of its mysteries. I'm going to say that this is probably one of the more original films that they, or any other studio, bigger or smaller, already released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of an ill-executed boatman returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him, as well as all who were in the spring. In this mix comes the granddaughter of one of the ghost victims, the current boatman. She takes over the ferry business as the ghost approaches the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Wrapped in dense fog and defined mainly in the single marsh set this is more musical poem than the regular feature film. Listen to the rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early scenes, their poetic cadence for them. Likewise, there is a cadence similar to the work of the camera as it travels from side to side through the swamp, as if it were crossing the path between life and death, innocence and guilt. The movie reminds me of an opera or oratorio class or musical object more than a normal horror film. It is an incredible piece of film production that is probably unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not to be a Lilly guild. This is a horror / mystery low budget that tells you a little story that will keep you entertained. His tale of love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetic film and draws attention first (the technical aspects are just facade). If there is any real flaw is the low price of production. The fog creates a climate, but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land. The constant back and forth is good for a while, but even after 58 minutes, you wish we could see something else. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I really like the movie. It's a good movie that I would like to have a little less poverty. It's definitely worth a look if you can come across it.
