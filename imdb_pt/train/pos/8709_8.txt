I recently (May 2008) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I've seen a lot of high quality movies since then (late 70's (I was 10 in 1978)), this low-cost, three-episode thing is still strong. <br /> <br /> What is fun? I now watched with my 10-year-old daughter, and she experiences the same way I remember from that time: The scary music (she had to hold my hand, despite being raised watching LotR and Resident Evil), the ever-changing theories of who is really to blame, and also complaining about the theatrical voices of an era before Norway discovered the difference between theatrical performance and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> This is the only good science fiction film (or series) ever made in Norway. And still worth watching.
