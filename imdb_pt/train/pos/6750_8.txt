This is a very well done film, meticulously directed and with an excellent character that is sometimes deeply moving - for example, the scene with the loyal but not sophisticated cop and his wife. The plot is convincingly worked and exciting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It became clear that the cops are as rude and ready as the characters in the underworld. <br /> <br /> A couple of small reservations: I found the end slightly one-sided as it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the structure of the police. the police and the judicial system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police personages who were held up to that point. I also found the female protagonist somewhat weak: little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, all she seems to do is cry and faint while the tough people fight against it.
