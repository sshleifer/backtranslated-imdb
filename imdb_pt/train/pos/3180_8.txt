A friend lent me this DVD, which he received from the director at a festival, I think. I was alerted that some of the technical aspects of the film were a bit unstable and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe this colored my judgment, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the actors. Youssef Kerkor was very good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a nice way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommates who drive Ernie crazy. Bill's character (Justin Lane), who spends much of the movie dressed as a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college classmate who called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind and very funny. Some of the other performances were good, some were like that, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the pair of vigilantes. Ridiculous and funny. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a high note, even if it has some problems, because you can tell when you've watched these people care, and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and crew.
