I gave it a rating of 8 stars. The story may have fallen about 3/4 of the way to the picture, but the performances remained strong throughout. "Men of Honor" was changed from "Navy Diver", understandably so. Anyone who has served in any branch of the military will probably feel that "Honor" is an appropriate word to use in the title.
