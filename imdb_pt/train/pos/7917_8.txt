After reading the other reviews and tepid comments, I felt I had to come to the battle for this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films tend to have little to do with each other, and hoping that this one is like one of the others. What you liked is probably off target. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a thoughtful and daring look at religious faith. The only other film like this - in terms of his religious message - would have to be "The Rapture," by Tolkin. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised anyone can say that the story is confusing or supernatural. It is a simple film about the Catholic faith, miracles and redemption - though you would never guess to the end. It's also the only movie I can think of, whose resolution turns literally into a pun. <br /> <br /> As I (fortunately) fallen Catholic, I know what the film is about, and I find a kind of caring in its ultimate innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology the film is based on, then it will go right through you. Like a movie - as opposed to a story - "Cold Heaven", it is not groundbreaking. While 'The Rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematographic images, 'Cold Heaven' minimizes its own cinematic qualities. There are no stunning photos, no bold effects, no attempts to tweak the content to the form. It's a work shot but subdued. Neither has dialogue or action to put you into a great drama class. It's a simple story that unfolds simply. It may seem strange; but in the end the mystery is revealed. It seems ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity disappears in a cloud of Catholic dogmas. <br /> <br /> In that sense, Cold Heaven has exactly the same kind of thing that drives a movie like The Sting. "or" The Sixth Sense, "or" The Last Descent, "or" The Pure Formality "of Polanski.All these are movies with a trick on the sleeves.These may frustrate you along the way but they have a point - a of course - but the amusement is, at least in part, to have been taken in. Still, even though it seems little more than a furry dog ​​story with a joke, it's worth it. It pays to observe how it directs - and distorts - you. Try it - especially if you are or have already been Catholic.
