Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays Marjorie, a woman who can escape the clutches of a potential rapist. Well done to Farrah for being nominated for Golden Globe as Best Actress. <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (terribly played by James Russo) arrives at her house, which she shares with her two roommates out!), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's scary demands. This causes some disturbing and shocking pictures! <br /> <br /> When their roommates come home, they are impressed (to say the least) by Marjorie's actions, and a great performance by Alfre Woodard who desperately tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and transform it on the police, makes the film even sharper. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid quite annoying but when Joe finally admits he came over there to kill them all that makes the movie a very emotional piece of drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, Extremities is a brilliantly thought-out and well-represented film and I must have watched it hundreds of times so far! Well done to all involved.
