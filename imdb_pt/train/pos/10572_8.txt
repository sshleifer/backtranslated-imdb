I have the feeling that the musicals of the Warner Bros. Depression season are going to become much more relevant in the years to come. Yes, we are in economic downturn (or you have lived under a rock) and the times seem bleak. But we always have the movies as a way to escape our problems. In the 1930s, cinema was immensely popular even at the height of the economic crisis. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one of those films that the audience welcomed. Although this musical directed by Lloyd Bacon fails to capture the social issues of the time as "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)" does, it is still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three Busby Berkely extravaganza numbers, but, man, they're worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her touch is more or less, but Busby's magic "By A Waterfall" takes her, and what appears to be a hundred other showgirls in a wonderland . Of course, Busby's numbers could never really be performed on stage (they defy the limits of gravity, on the one hand), and they contrast terribly with the realism of the harsh, malicious non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his few musicals (really, what could not that man do?). He even takes on the role of the protagonist, wears sailor clothes and adores the hottie Shanghai Lil (which is really the little girl's Chinese wig!). He co-starred Joan Blondell, his adorable and lovable secretary, whom Cagney somehow neglects in favor of other women (to the end, that is). Apparently, Blondell was the only other woman Cagney loved besides his wife. And you can see mutual worship in every scene.
