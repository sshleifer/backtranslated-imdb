STAR RATING: ***** Not permissible **** Very good *** Ok ** You could go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs Stuck-up career bitch Kate (Franka Potente) goes to the London subway to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a busy day of work, she sleeps and wakes up to find herself alone on a deserted platform. As she runs into a situation leading her from one scary encounter to the next, however, she learns from something much more evil and evil waiting for her out there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British film industry is really becoming one, especially in the department of horror thriller, with films like Creep and the successful 28 Days Later (which has strong echoes in parts) . In terms of success in what he set out to do Creep cleverly creates (especially in the beginning) a frightening feeling of isolation and tense fear. In its clever execution time, too (though I inadvertently suspect it) manages to honor some of the pioneering high-concept horror movies of the '70s that depend on shock and fear all the time without actually focusing too much on character development and < <br /> <br /> From their weaknesses, some scenes are a bit predictable, but they can not actually make it less scary or effective. I'm not sure if the end was made to make it come out as a kind of morality and is not exactly perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves its basic function very well. ***
