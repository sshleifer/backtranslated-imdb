The tighter the drama, the better the rivalry movie between sisters! This little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I'm happy to find out that was not the whole affair. Funny jokes about small town fights are there to take advantage of for sure, but the drama takes center stage as the story progresses. And not just family drama, it also raises poignant questions about respect for people's lifestyle differences. <br /> <br /> Great set of characters with many dramatic and exciting scenes that mark points of credibility; and they are not just scattered, but keep everything in place. It just makes me assume that if Ingmar Bergman had done it (the drama would suit him!), International attention would probably have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
