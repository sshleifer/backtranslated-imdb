Cinderella is a beautiful film with beautiful songs, of course. In fact, it's one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are portrayed in a surprising way. You can see the cruelty of the Cinderella sisters and their stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. Rats are funny and sweet as well. <br /> <br /> I think they've changed the tale a bit, but I think it's the best. It's such a good movie, and I do not think anyone can resist in the background. <br /> <br /> I give an 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it sure is a true classic.
