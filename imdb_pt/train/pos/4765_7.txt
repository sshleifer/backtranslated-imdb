A priest who has abandoned his ministry finds a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This film deals with the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post-war France, it is also about the mortal aspect of the Faith itself. This may not be the movie of a life, but it is a sin to allow it to fall into oblivion. Moreover, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
