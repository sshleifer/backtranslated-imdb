Here is a movie straight from my childhood, my family used to record; but kind of has been tapped and lost over the years. Now I was lucky to watch the entire movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I watched as a kid, and after watching it again (online), I still do it today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I'll always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (in who did the animation of who), that some of the animators date back to 1930 (WOW! that's like 47 years old).
