Shortly after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was invited to create something to try to bridge the gap between the UK and the US. At the time, there was a lot of comment type "overpaid, over sexed and over here". Somehow they came with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. It has everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very peculiar. <br /> <br /> I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points. <br /> <br /> Was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful ensembles, the inspired script? Who knows. But * watch and see what I mean.
