I first saw Frailty's trailer on Yahoo Movies after hearing Stephen King praise him in the highest. Not a fan of any of the stars, I still wanted to see him because I'm a big fan of suspense. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The performance was excellent, especially the two boys. Usually I hate kids-actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were great. Bill Paxton really did a good job at directing it as well. It was beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> One should also note the plot twists. The three twists in the end hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me shivers until today, though I have watched the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> A real jewel.
