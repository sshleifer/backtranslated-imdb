When I discovered that Brian Krause was in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to realize that I saw the original of it and I loved it. So I still had more reason to watch. Well, I watched. In fact, it was better than most TV movie sequences. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for himself) and I did not like most of the characters, including Brian's. But the film needed the tacky and annoying characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more. In the end, I was rooting for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, I suggest you watch it.
