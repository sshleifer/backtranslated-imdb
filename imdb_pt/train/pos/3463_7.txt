I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew a lot about the Beatles' music and the truth behind the breakup, as did things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band, Wings. I was curious to see how this movie would deal with the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references the two musicians used were very accurate. These included how Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever he went, the song "Silly Love Songs" from the Wings, being the number one hit that year and the Apple Studios rooftop playing songs from the album Let It Be. The actors did a great job playing John and Paul. The accents could have used a little more work, but they seemed to act as if I had read the two former Beatles who used to perform. I also enjoyed the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. <br /> <br /> The ending at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you'll like it, especially as this was how it actually happened in real life. They also show off the fantastic skit of "Saturday Night Live," in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to perform at the show. (compared to the other $ 220 million they were offering) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. This really gives you an idea of ​​why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back.
