When I first saw this film in London in 1958, I was surprised. I had never seen such a movie before. It had a strange and hypnotic effect, quite different from the films I had seen previously and left a lasting impact. <br /> <br /> I believe Odile Versus & Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Certainly the interaction is incredible in its power to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this was converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original language in French, I would love to hear about it and where it can be bought.
