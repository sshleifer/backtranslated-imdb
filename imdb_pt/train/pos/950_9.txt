The setting and the actors make this television film to me the best interpretation of the classic Dickens tale. George C. Scott is very believable, just like the rest of the cast. His Scrooge exudes wickedly until the end of the movie. Then your character changes to someone who is truly sorry. The 19th-century English city chosen for the setting creates an environment that fits Dickens and increases the plausibility of this film. It's a movie I watch every Christmas along with the real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
