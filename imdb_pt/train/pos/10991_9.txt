Cypher is a movie that deserves to be seen because it is not a common science fiction movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a sort of macro view of what is happening. The approximate view of the camera is how the director maintains the illusory plot. The science fiction aspect of the film is secondary to the movie's plot. The technology used in the film is not very impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props. <br /> <br /> The development of the character is intentionally superficial. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to dive into the world of espionage. It's up to the public to discover their enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested to the end.
