My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this movie and we were absolutely delighted with the captivating fun of the movie. There's an extra appeal for boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women like the movie and especially Hallie's refrain Kate Eisenberg, "Boys are so weird." It is refreshing to see a movie that shows mercilessly that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys really do these kinds of weird things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers! We enjoyed the movie so much that my son and an 11 year old friend, myself and my 23 year old daughters boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a boys day out. We had even more fun the second time and everyone was excited about it. It's clean and delightfully portrayed by a pre-teen cast that reminiscent of the TV classic "Freaks and Geeks." We all feel that it will become a success not unlike the "Freaks & Geeks," who did not survive their first season, but exhausted their DVD release. See it especially if you have boys and you will find that this encourages conversations about fun and safety! The girls will love it because of the opportunity it has to say: "Boys are so weird!" Do not miss ...
