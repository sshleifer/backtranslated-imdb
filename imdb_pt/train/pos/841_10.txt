I found this a deeply entertaining dark comedy. Brosnan is great; as anyone will now testify, it should not be labeled on the binding paper. Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could be on paper. I do not know if I laugh so much during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite phrase would be "I feel like a prostitute from Bangkok on a Sunday after the Navy left the city". Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comic finesse. I was also very impressed with Hope Davis' performance. It seems that everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such an extent that they improved the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you'll definitely enjoy this. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
