This Chinese film made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture that I do not belong and are far from being. In a quasi-Buddhist approach, the film helps the person to relate to each character and the happiness of making things simple routine. <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu emanates goodness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and evil. Er Min, the retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes and comes from the most different people in this universe. A different China, this is far from Chinese realism, however, has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> I understood. You will not be disappointed.
