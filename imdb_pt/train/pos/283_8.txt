"The Days" is a typical family drama with a little prank - you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible so you really enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> The story, of course, for all the people who watched the show, is the world of Cooper Day, the middle son of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his remarks. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister, and a genius-little brother. The first episode, which will sound kind of stupid since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both the sister and the mother get pregnant. This is the first situation the writer reaches. Then the father leaves his job at the law firm. The youngest child gets a panic attack. The middle child quarrels with his sister's boyfriend. That's all in a day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit bad, but I like it. First, I thought the camera job was a ripoff, but then I got used to it and started liking it. I enjoyed the quiet conversations in a dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the acting. I admire the story. So I find myself wanting a second season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of this when the episode of 6 episodes on ABC came to an end. It's a really good show and it's nothing like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope fans stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can relate to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll enjoy this show. Very.
