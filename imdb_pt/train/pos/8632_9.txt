This is a moral comedy, so occasionally a soft touch of bitterness occurs, but a lightness softens all the sarcasm and the irony flows until suddenly a moment will stop your heart and change everything. <br /> <br /> This beautifully written and directed film is a jewel that shines perfectly, with beautiful acting of all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and brilliant, which is not to be missed. A truly wonderful film !!
