This is the only David Zucker movie that does not fake anything the first of its kind. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury just behind But I do not think Theres something about mary was funny so that does not count except for the straightforward thing and he beans it. Do not listen to the critics, especially Roger Ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at their opinions. Still, watching him you will not be disappointed
