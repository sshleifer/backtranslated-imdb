Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in this Hollywood story. Their performances and songs are unique and special in the big movie theaters. The scene in which she is introduced to the unexpected audience of Kristopherson, against the wishes of the crowds and hers, just to show them off with her magnificent performance of "Woman In The Moon" is one of the best examples on film of how well a great artist can win an audience. It's real. The scene in which she records Evergreen is among the best in the business ... all live, unsynchronized, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a Diva, but she does. She is majestic singing "With One More Look At You." She earned the Oscar that she and Paul Williams won for Evergreen, and Kristopherson had her moments too, well above most of her movie appearances. First of all, one of 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March) although I always enjoy the musical remake of Judy Garland and James Mason of 1954. I have not yet seen the DVD and I do not know its quality.
