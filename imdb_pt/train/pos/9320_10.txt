A short film from MGM MINIATURE. The publisher of Cole County Clarion must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers: an impending frost that can mean a disaster for his crops, or the sensational overthrow. of a notorious gangster on his main street in a small town. <br /> <br /> This is a fun one-reeler, with a good performance of the comic strip Charles 'Chic' Sale. Today's viewers may be more interested in the appearance of the uncredited James Stewart as Sale's nephew / assistant. Speaking slowly and somewhat silly, Stewart shows many of the attributes that would make him a great star in a short time. Often neglected or overlooked today, the short one- and two-drum topics were helpful to the Studios as important training camps for new talents both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a short, successful subject was completely different from that of a feature film, such as writing a first-rate tale instead of a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedule and able to portray a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to studio films.
