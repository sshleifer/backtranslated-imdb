Musically speaking, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another more plausible musical after Top Hat, if that were possible. Although in this case Jerome Kern made Roberta what they were, Follow the Fleet kept Randolph Scott with another vocalist, this time Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is a Navy career CPO and Fred Astaire is an Ex-Vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget his ex-partner Ginger Rogers. But now the two are on shore leave. Fred and Ginger pick up exactly where they left off, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's sloppy sister, Harriet, who blooms in true beauty. But Randy is a typical love and leaves the sailor. <br /> <br /> Once again Irving Berlin wrote a very successful score with him overseeing the production. Ginger begins to make a really remarkable vocalization with Let Yourself Go, which she and Fred later dance to. But the true success of the show is Let's Face, Music and Dance, which is a number made in a Navy show. First sung by Astaire and then danced by the pair, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance in this is absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who it was. But they will know immediately when I mention it together with their famous husband Ozzie Nelson. That's right, Ozzie and Harriet. It's a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she'd just become David's and Ricky's mother on television. Then again, she did not even keep her own name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really carry a song. She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I'm here, but where are you both with real feeling and class. I recommend you to see Follow the Fleet, if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today.
