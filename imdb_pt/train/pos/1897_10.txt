Again, it seems totally illogical, at least to me, that "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece here is the totally "unlikely," if not quite "impossible," fusion of wildly different elements. The fact that he can make alcoholism friendly to laughter, rather than tragic, is by itself wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his best role, and any other cinematic element here presented, its great impact, including the score, seems patent and notorious to me. I challenge anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh out loud. But apparently, almost a third of his audience succeeded. Well, for example, I found and found Gordon's effort as laughable and amiable as Geraldine Fitzgerald's great-aunt bastards and Stephen Elliott's murderous killer, absolute gems of background characters. Even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronage, and the late Sir John Gielgud was right in accepting his fees, but wrong in assuming his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Underztand", much less rationalize, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not drink, it is other drugs of choice, including methamphetamine, and addictions are just symptoms, not targets), simply notes in their own quizzical way.
