Letters without destiny end in another world found at the back of the post office. Here Alice gets a job hoping to find her lost father. What she discovers is the tormented soul of her boss, Frank. A little Australian flog that came and went in the movies. Now you find him in the dark corner of the video store, overshadowed by fifty copies of the dreaded GODZILLA movie. It's a shame because this was a satisfying film telling a brave tale with simple, strong images and effective performances from both tracks. This film succeeds where Garry Marshall's other dead letter office, DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed, and approaches the brilliance of, not the turkey Kevin Costner, but He Jianjun's POSTMAN (1995 - China).
