One of John's Funniest, Eugene Levy is great too, I just wanted the studio to find out that this needs to be on DVD, I have it on video tape, but I feel like this movie deserves DVD (and extras would be great) Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) is so funny, just like the whole movie, also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and family are great, this movie never seems to be on TV but loses more It's hilarious when edited for TV broadcast , if you can find the video I suggest you buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy) I'm going to keep my VHS until one day we'll see it on DVD. There are so many great movies out there that have not yet been released on DVD, and that's one of them.
