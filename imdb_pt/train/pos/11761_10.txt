Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives from his past glories, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his opposite in a rare low performance like Jack Dundee. He dropped the Big Pass in more than one way. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into a movie, as Jack hisses at a mouse, Reno poses, and the caribou call comes out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that does not scare football in the mud as it should be played (NFL note).
