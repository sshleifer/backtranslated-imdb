For me, movies and acting are about telling a story. The story of David and Beth-sheba is a tragedy that is profound and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this film I thought the narrative of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was at its best. Knowing and understanding the story of David and his journey to become the king of Israel made this story all the more compelling. You could feel your lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who in his time was greater than life. Susan Hayward's fear, reluctance, but then obedience to her authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her. One could also feel the anguish of David at the time when Uriah spent the night at the gate, rather than at home. As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. Raymond Massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. The scenarios were quite real and the atmosphere was believable. In short, I think this was one of the best films of its kind. I gave a note of ten.
