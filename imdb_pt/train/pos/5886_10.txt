Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn the world around with their smiles. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this combination come together and start. Watch and look forward to hitting sixty! Mary challenges the youth-oriented society with intelligence and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism. A follow-up to the TV series would broaden the new characters and give us the chance to see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
