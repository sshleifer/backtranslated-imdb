I found this movie by chance, but I'm glad I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much nicer film. This film brought to mind the excellent films that Branagh did with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turns here as a handicapped young woman who seeks to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen of a female lead in a long time. Portraying a disabled person is difficult to do, but basically with just the eyes to show her pain about her situation in life, she has made it so believable. If this movie had come out after the current wave of films with beautiful women "struggling" for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I'm sure Carter would have strong consideration for an Oscar. If you come across this cable late night movie like I did, trust me, it's worth the lost sleep.
