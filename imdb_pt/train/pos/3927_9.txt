Okay, first a fix for the tag posted on the main page of the movie. Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie, nor did he stop at his sister's grave. The individual in question is Ann Rutledge, who was a very close friend of Lincoln in his days in New Salem. Some say Ann was, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support her. <br /> <br /> Now there are inventions and fictions in the movie. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic leave with anything under the sun, and "young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the court case that is in the movie is based on a real event: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and even though it is largely fictionalized in this film, with many name changes, it will still have spectators trapped on the screen . This is the Golden Age of Hollywood, with drama at its best, and Henry Fonda gives possibly the best Lincoln played by anyone.
