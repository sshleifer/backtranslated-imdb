Well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy, on average, what is curiously portrayed from the mother to the prostitute, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or flagrantly. Unlike many of you, I've only seen La Maman and La Putain twice. Like many good movies, I realized that my opinion improved after a second screening. All I know is what I've seen and I still have to dig deep into new explorations until I bought the DVD myself. I still have to figure out exactly why I like this film so much, but really, what does it matter to me why? Although I'm sure I could and I will form a wonderful explanation. Okay, so you might disagree, maybe it's a little annoying at times, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a lovely Grushenka.
