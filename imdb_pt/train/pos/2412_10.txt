I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best in the "Drama" series written and represented to enter any network in a long time. This show had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This could be developed in a great Primetime Soap. People are eager for this kind of acting, as we're being "Reality TV" overrated. I long for the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept very well and I predicted that it would only improve. There is a lot to expand with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating by themselves. It would be a loss not to explore this and develop these characters after they have lured us into our world. I simply loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual, without overdoing or offending. Loved it.
