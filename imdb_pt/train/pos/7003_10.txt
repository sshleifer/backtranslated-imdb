The emotional impact of this film defies words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic, all in two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures in his acting ability, the full range of it. Who knows? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be an accident for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both films depict another dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of the scripts, I'm not sure, but now I see it differently. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that, to fully enjoy its essence, you need to suspend your belief. Do not watch the conspiracy, watch the fragile condition of the human heart, literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.
