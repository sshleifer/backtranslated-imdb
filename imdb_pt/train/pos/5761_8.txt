I swear, that zombie was killed twice and kept coming back. I gave this film a 8. Let's face it personally, this is exactly what other reviewers are saying, ie a "hand-drawn" movie. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the total indy movie. The fact that Todd Sheets has more than 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents. Yes, history has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over, but who really cares? Accept what it is, a fun and bloody horror movie, one to share with your friends, or to piss off the people who really care about LOL. Mature people, I suppose you all like pieces of junk like "Titanic" or "Twister". Peace, and support independent film production !!!
