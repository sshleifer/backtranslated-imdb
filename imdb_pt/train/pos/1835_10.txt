What a great movie this is that I have no words to describe. I do not know how it is that the rating of the movie is 7.3 should be 9.3 but anyway no one else can do this movie and Akshay's acting is simply excellent the second half of the movie makes you cry and the movie has really good unexpected ending that makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once, I think twice well, even you. Anyway I love this movie and it's not just sad and funny, but it also gives u a very good meaning and you should do this, I think this is one of the best movies in Bollywood history. but I know that people have deferents, so choose. the only thing I do not like about this movie is the song well, the background music is good, but the songs are not good enough, I think the music would be better if AR Rahman was the musical director, but in any case not we can do nothing about it, then ya.
