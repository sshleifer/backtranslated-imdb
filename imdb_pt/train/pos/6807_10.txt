I have copies of these two films, the classic where Robert Blake is a great actor, where most of the 1967 film Blake is most shown standing next to a window in prison, telling his childhood life because he killed to Clutter Family. show a lot in the classic of what really happened and does not tell us what actually did the murder, but it's a real draw really if you watch the 1996 movie in Cold Blood, the classic makes a lot more sense.
