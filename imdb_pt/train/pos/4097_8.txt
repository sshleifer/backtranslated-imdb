Youth, sexuality and the interior of France - one of the most original films you will see. If you can see this, it is not at all easy considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes it's erotic, sometimes disgusting and occasionally funny. A bit annoying too in the middle, but all in all you can not call yourself a bizarre movie aficionado until you've seen this one at least once.
