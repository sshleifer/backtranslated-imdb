This crime thriller is like a noir movie, although it changes the postwar context to the Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street," the cops are good, criminals are genuine, and the only enemies are "The Commies," who are distinguished from good guys by being endowed with emotional personality, driven by real care. its own value, as shown in the constant close-ups accompanying the film. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around characters. The personalities of this film are quite unique and detailed: skip the pocket that is able to face any danger and sometimes while passing through your personal possessions; Moe, the informant who's just trying to save money for a spectacular funeral, but who can capture the hearts and respect of almost every other character (and audience); Candy, the innocent innocent girl who thinks she's doing government work and does not fully understand the conspiracy with which she's involved; and Joey, the villainous ex-boyfriend of the Commie who is trying to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person to do so. Play a lot of very colorful supporting characters (like the guy with the chopsticks and the cops) and "Pickup on South Street" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the pictures of mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilms. <Br/> <br /> --PolarisDiB
