Three flashbacks feature the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to these same characters. Three times Ahmad pronounces the absolute word "Time," in his declaration of love to the princess, answering three questions in his first of three meetings. So strong is the impression he makes, that the Princess will resist Jaffar's three attempts to conquer her - by three successive stratagems: fraud, hypnosis, and erasure of memory. However, Jaffar possesses what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical horse, the Genie and the Genie, and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu in his first of three encounters; three times the genius laughs loudly in the gorges of the mountains and three are his considerations on the human frailty before leaving. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that transports him in time to save Ahmad and the princess and the bow and arrow to execute Jaffar. There is magic in number three and there is magic in this movie.
