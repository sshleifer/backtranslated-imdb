As many critics here have noted, the film version differs somewhat from the stage version of the story. I've never seen the theatrical version of the story and therefore I have a more favorable review of the film than many other critics. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still a fun story of several dancers trying to make the best time in the show by the choreographer Michael Douglas. The film does right by not selecting any famous actor or artist to end up in the final group. In this way, our attention is focused on the movements of the dancers and on the individual stories and struggles that take place during a test marathon. Douglas also probably is not the best choice for the role. Apparently some songs were cut in favor of a new one, and the clich√© story of a romantic connection between a dancer and the choreographer was added behind the scenes. I have to say in all fairness that this was the weaker part of the movie. Cassie's repeated intrusions during the tests seem to mirror the almost desperate appeals that often need to be made when engaging in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film was made to death in the past, and it is curious to see this tired old shoe kicking his heel again. The revelations of the dancers themselves got quite promising with the number "I can do that", but then it crept up a little at various points as the dancers told their stories. Frankly, their stories differ little from real-life people who never get a chance like that. *** of 4 stars.
