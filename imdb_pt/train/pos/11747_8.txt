A good effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising since there seems to be some resurgence of the Australian quality drama. I dare compare this show with the brightness of love my way? do not. but it is reminiscent of the initial secret life of us. the cast is great, gibney works its magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the British cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters. but abe forsythe can be the saving light (not that it needs to be saved) if this show has another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the impressive time series of impressive marking a few years ago but he was great as always in greener. It's also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. Let's hope the show keeps getting better with each episode.
