This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows, which after a stressful day at school, I sit in front of the TV and watch. Because? Because I really like it, and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke is amazing like Dr. Mark Sloan, a doctor who turned detective and who, with his son, solves murders. He is accompanied by a largely unknown but very competent support cast, that is, his real-life son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that in every series her hairstyle changes. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I particularly loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and I was intrigued by how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with big invited stars, it's a bit obvious at times, like Colombo, but in every episode, there's always something to laugh at. In conclusion, a large series, with two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
