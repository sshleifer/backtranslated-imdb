The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Persian Bakhtiari tribe. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to reach the pasture. You will feel like a pampered wretch after seeing these people herd their animals through icy water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains trying to get their animals to walk down steep and narrow mountain paths.
