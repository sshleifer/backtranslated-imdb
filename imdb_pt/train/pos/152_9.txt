I saw "El Mar" yesterday and thought it was a great movie. It begins with an episode of childhood in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that, we jumped about 10 years to a hospital where the 3 friends are reunited. <br /> <br /> Religion, disease, love, violence and sexuality are raging throughout the film, creating an intense and tense movie. <BR> I see people complaining about the movie being very bloody and I think they missed the point of the story. It is a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. Cry. Get hurt. To bleed. And I think what the movie shows, is not made for pure shock value or presented in an unpleasant way. I know some people like their "clean" films, even those with violence. But sometimes a movie needs to make you feel uncomfortable to work with. This is one of those movies. And a great movie is. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I found was that there were 3 or 4 times when some plot details were not 100% clear, and only after thinking of them at the end of the movie. movie, everything made sense. But it was not anything very important to the overall story, so I still give this movie a 9.
