Surprisingly good. The acting was fun, the script was fun, the music was fun, the plot was incredibly fun. This was a fun movie to watch and give rest to your brain. Plot parts and quotes that I found very creative. 7 out of 10. Actually, for what it was, it would deserve 10 out of 10. You should not compare this to an art film or a blood film.
