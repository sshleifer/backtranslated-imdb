This great movie could not register a rating higher than 5. Why not! It is a great portrait of the life of Christ without the cruel sensationalism of The Passion of Christ. Johnny Cash did great things for God that are surprisingly avoided and neglected in areas where they should be more important, like our churches. The film itself took less than a month to get filmed, as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through him. Great credit to everyone involved in this extremely candid movie that will always be treasured. At least Billy Graham's crusade valued him enough to use it as a prime source of education for the new Christians. Thank you Fox for producing it. As Walk the Line proved that it was weird that this man had survived and produced an underrated masterpiece. Films are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves! In summary, I believe this film is one of the great documentaries of the world, for being honest, honestly portrayed and a great testimony of the Christian faith!
