Perhaps you do not mind the social commentary, or the filmmakers' point of view (I myself am perplexed by the angle of "insignificance" that Kasdan seemed to promote?) When clearly, the actions taken in the film promote certain significance. ). However, there is no denying the way in which the story is presented; the magnificent symbolism everywhere; the arcs of chained characters; visual effects; dialogue ?? is an absolute masterpiece. I've watched the movie dozens of times, and still marvel at its perfection. There is not a moment, action, cut or line that does not have everything to do with the theme. Realistic human performances of all actors. Scene the scene is fantastically woven. <br /> <br /> I have a well leveled sap meter. The doorbell never fired during this movie. Are you a thinker (rather than a casual viewer)? this movie delivers. Exponentially Absolutely hypnotizing. (Do you have to agree to the message to enjoy the exhibit? Who cares if it made you hot and confused or not, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, did the movie affect me ?? significantly. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The front page reviewer speaks clearly of poor African American perceptions. What could he have failed to recognize was there a hand? shake. It is not a hand. The "spiritually dead white man" simply saw a man to respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that he was black had little or nothing to do with it (color is simply used to draw the parallel, and the abyss.) It is not by chance that the opening sequence also changes from black and white to color. If you see the blacks in this movie as "token"? you may want to reassess your anguish. You may be seeing only black and white, huh. Just a thought.
