The novel of the film, which is also its main theme, is good and well presented. However, the ambience of the love story is very lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Worse yet, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the movie. Do not hesitate to watch this movie if it attracted your interest, but do not expect too much from it too.
