I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the movie and he said that everything was fine. I thought the title was a bit exaggerated, since the version in our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I hoped this movie was a little Halloween with a killer wood guy. But it opened with a good scene and the murderer immediately murdered two victims and showed him twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him killed both people (including his mother) and even testified that his father's suicide is going to an isolated hut . the forest with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears until a wooden statue comes alive with the spirit of his father. Very good for a sequel and I've never seen the first.
