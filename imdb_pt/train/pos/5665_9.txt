They've had me since the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A place like Mayberry, with a little difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is the spoiler. Not like you would not find out in 10 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people are trying to keep you well, but it's a difficult battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and enjoys spending time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Subtle. Sneaky. It does not always go wrong. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor because he often creates a calamity and saves them from it. So every time you think someone will finally knock you down, one of your friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage you. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the woods in a cabin. and some guys with guns decided to steal them. Luke used this as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) hesitated to kill them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted was half conscious. If he had not conscience, he would have shot at them by now. If he had a real conscience, he would never have become a criminal. Then he started calling him Half-Ted. It was very funny. He was provoking the criminals. And of course he got 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times. And of course he was in total control at all times. They really had you favoring Satan. <br /> <br /> Very excellent show. It was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Supernatural Gothic <br /> <br /> That's good company.
