At the beginning of the film, we see May and Toots preparing for their trip to London for a visit to their adult children. You can see that Toots is not in the best of health, but he goes on. When he dies suddenly, May's world begins to get out of control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a screen by Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure comes to an agreement. with her new status in life and her awakening in a world she does not even know existed until now. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban wife was probably boring. Obviously, his sex life was almost nothing. We learned that she had a little extra marital affair, then nothing. When May loses her husband, she can not return home, so instead she is after her grandson at her daughter's house. It is in this scenario that May begins to covet the young and hilarious Darren, his daughter's occasional lover. <br /> <br /> Darren awakens in May a passion she never knew. May responds by turning in front of our eyes. May, who at the beginning of the film is sloppy, suddenly begins to dress up, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling headlong with this young man who keeps her satiated with a passion she has never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having known a few cases similar to this story, it was no surprise to me to see May's reaction. His own chance for a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends up frustrating for May, who realizes the how much your sex is great with Darren. The younger man, we figured out, is just in this case to satisfy himself and the possibility of extorting money from May. Finally, the daughter, Helen finds out what Mom has done in the back when she discovers the erotic paintings that her mother made. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May. Also incredible is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story because it is she who has to confront her mother about what is happening behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role as Bruce, the eldest man in Helen's class, and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The movie is rewarding for those who will come with an open mind. <br /> <br />
