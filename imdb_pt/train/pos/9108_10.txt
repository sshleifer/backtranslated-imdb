A True Story of a True Revolution, April 25; a revolution against a repressive 41-year regime that was imposing a colonial war on its armed forces for maintaining an empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, the first and last of the great empires colonial of Europe) of 600 years, from its beginning in the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; a revolution of the army for the people and for a democratic Portugal; The most surprising fact in this revolution is that there were no people dead in it (except those who died at the hands of PIDE, the state political police, during a brutal shootout against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of its headquarters in the city). The day of the revolution, on April 25, 1974, has a show in the film. And there are all the revolutions that have their heroes, one of them was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a soldier returned from war, whose convictions along with the rest of the army, were that they were fighting (since 1961) a war without hope, and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey his country.
