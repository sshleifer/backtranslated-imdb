The original film DeMille was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A really good movie. The love of Hollywood for remakes brings us a rather interesting film starring Yul Brynner. He, of course, was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the movie used to get a bit long in some places. It does not move to the rhythm of the 1938 version. Still, it's a fun movie that must be seen at least once.
