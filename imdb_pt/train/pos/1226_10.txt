They filmed this movie on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was too hard to keep swallowing over and over, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us have ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. He has never been in theaters (obviously) and, as far as I know, was never released on video, and I'm sure it was not released on DVD. However, it seems that was seen by some people, although probably very few. Then there must be something. I would love to buy this for my brother, but there is no way to find it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how this movie can be bought? And what format would it be?
