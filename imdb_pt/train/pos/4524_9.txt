This is a very rare example of a film about transvestism (of heterosexuals). The film deals with the topic of the taboo, so that even a general public that does not know of transvestism will strongly sympathize with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald / Geraldine and should not be overlooked by this brilliant performance. The direction of Christopher Monger is very sensitive, dealing with a question so difficult, very well, packed in a good story. It's not a great movie, not an "art" movie, but a lovely little movie!
