If the screenwriter and director wanted to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with their music, they were successful with me. Common human situations became original, personal, and immediate, so that I personally felt touched by every situation. I believe that I would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person who is writing the film. Without ruining it, I can say that I was very moved by the film's approach to life. Did not he really shout for joy? empathy? only deep emotion? in a long time. I'd love to find a way to show it to others. Saw at the Seattle International Film Festival.
