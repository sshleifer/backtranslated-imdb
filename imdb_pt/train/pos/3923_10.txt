This is an incredible film, both because of the incredible energy evoked by the frantic dance of flamenco and by the unique way that filmmakers intertwine the story of stage production with the lives of the characters who are preparing for it. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not 'Carmen de Bizet' by any usual standard. This is not a normal movie of any standard. Every nuanced look, every tap of the foot, every piece of music is so entrancingly entwined that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love opera or flamenco (I do not) to be captured, rapturous, enchanted with this movie. Subtle and direct; high and stationary; One of the films, if not the best, is the kind, because there are few like it.
