I was surprised at how a movie could be both flamboyant and excellent. The Frisbee flying saucer was beyond comprehension, especially when it landed, but the special effects when Krell struck were incredible for a movie that was made more than half a century ago! Living in the Middle East, I saw shadows of Islam infiltrate when JJ Adams suggested that Alta dressed more modestly and as an engineer was impressed by the imagery used for the "futuristic" gadgets and gadgets dreamed up by the props department. All in all, a fun hour and a half, the first time I saw Walter Pidgeon and the chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young man"
