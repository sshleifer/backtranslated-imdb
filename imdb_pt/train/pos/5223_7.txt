It does not seem that this movie has managed to please many people. First, many do not seem to have seen it in the first place (I just bumped into it by accident), and then judging by the comments and rating, from those who did many did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere because of his looks and charm, and even though I did not consider him a great actor, I know he can do a lot of crazy (I liked his Mr. Jones). But this performance is all different. He is not handsome in this, and he is not charming. Your character is completely different from anything I've seen of him up to that moment - old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, in what to me is so far his best performance, pulls beautifully. I think it's a sign of how well an actor does their job if you can not imagine someone doing it - think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo on Training Day. That's how Gere was right here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was fine for me too. I do not think I would have chosen the Danes in this role, mainly because I think she's too beautiful for that. But she really does a great job, holding on to a Gere at her best, which is no small feat. The Strickland easily offers the best supporting act, in a part that requires considerable reach of it. I really think she owns the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that's a great achievement. <br /> <br /> And the rest of the film, plus an excellent performance? The story may not be extremely surprising, some aspects of 8mm, but adding the story of "breaking from novice veteran" to "dunnit", and also (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency in trying to save the girl and the imminent retirement of Gere's character. All this is a backdrop for the development of the two main characters, as they help each other to establish themselves in their respective new seasons in life. That's a lot to do in 100 minutes, but it's well done, and we end up taking care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were adequate. I could have gone without the modern moves of video camera and cut but then I'm a grumpy old man, and it really was not that bad, in fact I think it helped with the atmosphere of the movie, which as you may have guessed, in general is not a happy. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
