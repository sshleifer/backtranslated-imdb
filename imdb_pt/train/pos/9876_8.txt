Introducing Lily Mars is a really nice little movie that shows the comedic skills of actress Judy Garland, along with her standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars scoring together after producer John Thornway for his big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
