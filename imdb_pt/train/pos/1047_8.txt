It may be (or not) considered interesting that the only reason I actually checked this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who defeated Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for the movie). Oscar for Best Actor. (I would still have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I checked this movie because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the film preached a little, but I not only did not care, I liked the speeches and never got bored with them. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent in this film. I especially liked Paul Lukas. Lucile Watson (nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (unfairly unnamed), George Coulouris and, strangely, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle son. I really liked his character: a strange-looking kid who talks like a guy the philosopher, he just turns me on. Even the character's name (Bodo) is funny. The endin g, in which Lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong, although he was doing it for the right reasons, worked for me as well. I agreed with why he felt he had what he did, and I understood why he could not explain it. The message that this movie does is good and noble, the setting (which means the house) is beautiful and the acting is excellent. Watch this movie if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
