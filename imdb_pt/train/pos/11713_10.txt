I think it took a lot of courage for her to introduce herself that way. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers it is what most helps people. But in her case, what she did was remarkable. I've been in the mental health field for five years and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I believe it helped. I always thought she was great and always would be. I'm glad she wrote this book and that the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act. She went through a lot and faced it. I would really love to see her work more with children, especially children's actors. Her ordeal should not have happened and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor to the young. The film was so exciting for me that I was very excited. Suffering an TBI that brought the onset of my disorder and having PTSD, it is good to know that someone has the courage to show his life as she did. I believe that it has helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you Mrs. Duke or Anna, which you prefer.
