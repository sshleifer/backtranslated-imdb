To be honest, I watched this movie just because of my puberty needs. I mean, I could not get women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I figured seeing Elvira's cleavage was the sex closet. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a lot of fun with this service. Classic about horror comedy, Halloween parties, cheeky humor and some sexy evil exhibited by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just do not make movies like this anymore ... It had the feel of an amateurish endeavor mixed with a cable talk show host style late at night. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it has generated a lot of fans because of the humor and the ability to play Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is classic that reminds me of the good days of the USA Up All Night.
