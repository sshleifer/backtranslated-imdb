I remember this series so well. It was great - characters so strong and attractive, elegant and sexy ... and so different from all there was to offer at the time - and now ... I'm sure it inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders." <br /> <br /> Both Season 1 and Season 2 are available in Region 2 of the DVD in the UK. It's a treat to watch the show again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes and Season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get something special on Amazon.co.uk
