Very smart mood Excellent performance I can not believe how people could think it deserves a 1/10! I hope this movie is shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it. If you have the opportunity, watch it ... do not miss out. There is a part where the lead actors are directing and singing "Congratulations" and "The Plunderer Clown" ( an Argentine song for children (I think ... it can also be South American, I'm not sure)). These two songs have the same melody ... but people usually do not realize it ... just scream! I tried writing this in Spanish and English, because it's an Argentine film ... but the page would not allow me :( Hope you like it!
