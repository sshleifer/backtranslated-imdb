definitely needed a bit of work in the second season. Like the virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White along with his old and super cult. During Season Two, however, the only thing that kept me watching was to see if Max and Logan would get rid of the nasty virus that infected Max. Very good drama in Season Two. But of course, like all TV shows, if there is something wrong with that, the station will strip it out of the air. I was seriously waiting for a third and last season. The second season leaves you hanging, unless you read the books of Max Allan Collins, so you'll know what happens. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel must be put back on the air for another season, even though it may cost a little. too much to get all the original actors again. since the sky of the carrier Jessica Alba fired after the show. If this is the case, then there must be a movie to complete it. as well as the Firefly show, which, of course, FOX canceled as well.
