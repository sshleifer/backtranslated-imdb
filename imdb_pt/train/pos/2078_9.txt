This adaptation of the Pearl S. Buck movie is certainly a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has all the things a great Hollywood movie has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, joy, despair, and so on. There's only one thing that pisses me off. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters is played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and does an admirable job as Wang Lung, owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the part, but they should have put Anna May Wong on paper. I know why they did not, and Rainier is very good in the movie, but they hardly tried to make it look "authentic." Stillm is a great movie, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago). It's a must see, just look beyond casting. I think you can.
