This movie probably had a budget of $ 750 and still managed to overcome the Titanic. I rented it the day I hit my mother's car, and it was the only thing that excited me beyond belief! has to be tied with 'The Assult of the Killer Bimbos'. Things to look for are: 1. The drive in the Chinese girl blowjob scene 2. The blonde bleach on the shirt of sassoon that never changes 3. The Flinstone-like scream off driving 4. The shock set used by the redhead just before she gets dead (do not worry, I'm not spoiling any surprises as it's so predictable) 5. The guy you think you need to howl. 6. The mental patient who performs a compelling job of being insane, poking the eyes of a man. 7. The hour of persecution at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. The womman writing graffiti on the bathroom wall. 9. Last but not least, the wonderful special effects - especially the stab in the chest that made a ... heaven help me ... bursting the noise. <br /> <br /> Have fun! <br />
