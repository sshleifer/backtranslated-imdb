I just saw the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - A perfect treat - done wrong, moving, fun, dramatic and meaningful. I could not agree more. I just hope the rest of the Festival films reach this standard of entertainment and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films planned to be shown in Sydney in the coming months.
