Henry Hathaway was bold, as well as enthusiastic, for his love for the early American people. However, criticizing historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway has made a superb direction conveying what was a Mormon people at the beginning of the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the time that begins with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the date of the movie. In filming and often subtle dialogues, he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 50's. This was just over 10 years after the release of the films and before the Temple's end of Los Angeles, which I watched as being built and instilling a more curious curiosity about who the Mormons were. I recently bought this movie and I appreciate the following messages that Hathaway played in your movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Charity for those who need it or not, 3. Family matters, 4. Listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. Work hard, individually and in community, 6. Prepare and store for the next days of need, 7. Hope is a link to a higher being and to our day- to-day 8. And that there is a unique quality for anyone. group, and appreciate those who are identified as beneficial.
