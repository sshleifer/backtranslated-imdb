I loved this movie from the first time I saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at the accuracy with which Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, even as he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes it's scary how much he looks, acts, and speaks like the real Elvis. Fortunately this is being released on DVD, so everyone we've been waiting for can finally have an excellent quality version of the complete movie. I heard the detractors, who say there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but I think keeping in mind that John Carpenter had only about two and a half hours to work, and that this was being shown on television. (just two years after Elvis's death!) he did a good job with it. Actually I have not seen another Elvis movie that comes close to this one. Highly recommended.
