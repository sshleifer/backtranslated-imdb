"The first war to be 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a difficult movie to describe; comedy, satire, action, screwball. He remembered Dr. Strangelove once or twice, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job, I think). I did not have any particular expectations of this film, although I am a big fan of John Cusack, so I let the film pass for me. And as a result, I was quite entertained. Political satire is painfully accurate and quite condemnatory to the complex of US military companies. The subplots were a little predictable, but the final interweaving of the story lines made it all worth it. I can understand why this movie was not very popular in the US, but for the rest of the world it's a timely tale.
