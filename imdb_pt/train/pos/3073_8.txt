This is the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to do more. No extravagant props, no car chases, no clever lines. Only people dealing with being people. <br /> William Macy plays an unlikely killer who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the obedient son, Sutherland is the dominating father. Son wants to get out of business, father will not let. Macy loves her own son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he finds in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer while balancing his own needs with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And as you'd expect in a movie with William Macy, there's also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work around, actors and director. It's good to know that they can still make a good Hollywood movie on a small budget.
