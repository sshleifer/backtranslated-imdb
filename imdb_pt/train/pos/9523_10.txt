I loved this movie! I'm a true fan of Tom Hanks, and I've always been impressed with all of his work. From his most dramatic roles like Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. For her hilarious roles as A League of Their Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big and of course Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only great actor who lights the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, a rising star who shows great promise in Hollywood stars as the son of Hanks and offers nothing less than a great performance. He is certainly someone to take care of his career, I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman, as always, delivers brilliant on-screen performance. He is truly a legend. We can not forget the people who did not play such important roles in the film, but they nevertheless helped to make it great. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who has a performance in Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Female that I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the movie and does a great job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the movies. He does a great job with such a small role and, like his roles in Lemony Snickets, Sweet November and I Dreamed Of Africa, he does a great show.
