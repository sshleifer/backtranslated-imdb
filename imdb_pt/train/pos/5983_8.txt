I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal dominated the world. Trick Or Treat has all the elements for a movie that rocks. With a cast featuring Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons from Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? Back evil messages reproduced on vinyl! Yeah, that's right, they use records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rock star on his turntable when things start to get scary. Monsters begin to come out of your speakers and your stereo gets possessed. As a teenager, I tried to play my discs back and forth, hoping this would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies of all time.
