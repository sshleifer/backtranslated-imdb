I have not laughed so much in a long time - although the movie also has sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. The characters are very realistic most of the time, sentimental at times, but quite believable. I'm not a Jerry Springer fan - I'm sorry for the participants. This movie is a satire, and it is going very well. <br /> <br /> Too bad all the bad words were deleted while this movie was aired on public TV, which makes a lot of fun of it. I'll rent this movie to make the most of it. <br /> <br />
