I watched this movie as a child and it is the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on face and eyes in absolute horror in a particular scene. I remembered again with a dissolution with my friends and immediately bought in video with much hesitation that I could add (to my surprise I only found it on the web in the United States when it was made in England!) When I once again watched my reaction and to my surprise it was almost the same, of pure horror and fear and my heart never beat too much. This is in my opinion the SCARIEST movie already made, Hollywood movies seem tame in comparison and a little Pony and Trap (crap), pardon the pun. What is incredible, though, is the power of this movie and in uni while watching it with about twenty of my associates I've never heard so many screams, guys too! Even the vision of the video brings God's fear to me of that particular scene, and left me feeling that I will never walk alone again in the dark !!!!
