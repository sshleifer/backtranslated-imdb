I'm watching the series back as fast as possible. I'm trying to watch all the Star Trek stuff. This is month 3 and now I'm in the third season of TNG and I've been through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the largest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first recap episode of the TNG series. Having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how some of them were re-filmed because the movie looked better. The first season always seemed very dark and ugly-and the actors looked silly, as if they did not fit into their own skins. <br /> <br /> The show is essentially made from the greatest hits of the happiest and the saddest moments of Riker's life on the Enterprise to this point. The Data and Riker scene on the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the second officer of the Klingon ship defies Riker's authority as the first officer and Riker has won that Klingon's living CRAP. Then the Admiral kicks in his $$ but good. All this episode is a reminder of that crazy, great things have already happened in just 2 seasons, with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! At this point in the series they are really beginning to develop the emotions that link Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. So far, they have mentioned the fact, but they still need to exploit it. Let the record show that the ST Wiki - Alpha Memory states that Imzadi means "first" and denotes that she has had intimate relations with Riker and also remains deeply close to an emotional one. This episode further proves that there will be a romantic interest tense for each other for a long time. <br /> <br /> Here's the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By At this point in the series, the production value is up to speed and Star Trek TNG is settling in giant science fiction that was destined to become. Seeing this again as an adult, I now see what the GREAT ACTORS of the Star Trek universe offer. They really need to do a new ST show after all the current shows. A DS9 movie would also be cool.
