Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A comedy of chorus full of its own landmarks, with a frenetic pace and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! The music is everywhere, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and incredible gadgets and inventions, all colored visually for only entertaining. Pure cinema in essence. A wonderful experience to watch. And one is especially grateful since good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, this is one of them, and if you liked Kusturica's earlier films, you'll love it, although, as with all comedies, it's about a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood for it.
