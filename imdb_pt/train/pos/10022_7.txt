Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive on a mission in Guatemala in the 1970s. He also stated that he had murdered 16 other people (he killed pregnant women, and then set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that portrays Aro's personality through several interviews with people who knew him and through some scenes interpreted by actors based on real events. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, that it is not morbid. A horrible testimony about how childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 7/10
