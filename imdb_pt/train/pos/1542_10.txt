well done giving the perspective of the other side Fraulein Doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent performance especially when the German high command refuses on behalf of the cavalry to present ordered kaiser medal achieved. the scenes of carnage are probably very intense for tired American minds who would probably prefer some silly speeches and meaningless abstractions such as 14 points or the League of Nations. Americans can really enjoy plot and action. for all the action and intrigue, Fraulein Doktor compares favorably to Jacob's Ladder.
