I am quite surprised that no reviewer has so far commented on the elemental chess mistake in Luzhin's game as a white against an unnamed opponent just before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as an expert chess consultant, Lujin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. Among the quick cuts back and back to the board is not difficult to realize that after the combination of Lujin culminating in a queen sacrifice, his tower in d1 is still trapped by the black tower in c1 against his king in the corner in h1. Thus, he is unable to play the alleged mating movement Rd1-d8, which would be illegal - but he is shown doing so with ravishing applause from the audience.
