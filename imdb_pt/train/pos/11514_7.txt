It's not the most successful television project that John Cleese ever made, "Strange Case" has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any review could be made. There are some silly ideas everywhere and even some clever ones, but the story as a whole unfortunately does not contribute much. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a hoot, though, like Dr. Watson, bionic pieces and everything. "Good God."
