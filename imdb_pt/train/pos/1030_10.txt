I name it and BABYLON 5 as the best television science fiction series ever made. Both stand out in my mind because, unlike the initial series of STAR TREK, there is a consistent evolution of graphics and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and the STAR TREK: TNG, they were great shows, but there was no general theme or story line connecting all the episodes. In many ways, you can watch the shows totally out of sequence without difficulty in understanding what is occurring. This was less the case of DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that occupied the entire final season) and the other TREK shows, since there was one more story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long romance slowly take shape. Of course, there were a few "disposable" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually very funny. <br /> <br /> And by the way, funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and it was not so horribly serious. This way I really enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's really too bad that he's slowly been missing from the series in recent seasons. <br /> To really appreciate the SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show an exceptional staying power. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving a fair chance, then science fiction is probably NOT the genre for you.
