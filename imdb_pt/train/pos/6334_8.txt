This movie has some things that are incredible. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. This, by itself, is surprising that multiple tornadoes hit the same city at night in the fall of Nebraska. I wonder if the actual city name was near "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains-something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest tornadoes that register in the place where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene in which the TV gets confused is actually based. Before the Doppler radar and the weather radio, they taught us that if you connected your TV to a certain channel (not cable) and tuned the brightness correctly, you could tell if there was a tornado coming. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about midwest tornadoes, it has made this movie fun for me. I like more than Twister. I mean, give me a break ... there's no way you can get past it and F5 chaining to a pipe in a house as well.
