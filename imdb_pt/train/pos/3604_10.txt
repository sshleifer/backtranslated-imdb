I think it's a great movie. because you can see how Diana's life is at home. she has a lot of aggression and wants to prove that the girls can fight too. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I'm boxing too. This really impressed me. the only negative part that I think. It's the end. because everything is fine between Diana and Adrian. But you can not see what it's like at home. And I really did not like you either not to see how her father is, and her brother. but I think it was a great movie and I think I'll watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to anyone, even when you do not like boxing, you get to see a lot more than just boxing. I had so much fun watching it.
