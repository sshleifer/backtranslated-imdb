I was one of about 200 people who was lucky enough to see a preview of the movie. Stardust follows a young Tristan on a mission to find a fallen star and bring him back to the woman he loves to prove his love for her. The only problem is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a door between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joy to watch, has something in for everyone, all the action scenes are played beautifully and the comedy is spread throughout the film, making it funny without being mushy. If I had to compare tastes with another movie, it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All performances are excellent, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her interpretation of Yvaine. The naive and confident star under Michelle Pfeiffer's rating delivers a superior stellar performance like Larnia ... but the performance to speak to is Robert De Niro ... In every scene he is in hands down, he steals the show ... < If you're in the mood for a funny love story, this is the movie. The boys are not disillusioned with the description that there is enough action comedy and not to mention many eyes with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep him entertained everywhere. The cinematography is dead and continues with the feel of the film ... nothing about the film seems forced.
