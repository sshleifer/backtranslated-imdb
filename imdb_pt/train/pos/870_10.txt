"Read My Lips (sur mes l√®vres)" (which probably has a different idiom resonance in its French title) is a contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime, as characters uncommonly compared slide up and down Os two protagonists are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (whom I have never seen before, despite his long resume in French films) and an even more disheveled than the usual Vincent Cassel (who brought a sexy and / or threatening look and voice to some USA). <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is in its territory in a competitive real estate office and he is the neophyte. The second half is in his territory as an ex-convict and his painful adaptation to that environment. Writer / director Jacques Audiard very cleverly uses the woman's insulation impairment as an input to us in her perceptions, turning the sound up and down so we hear how she does (so it is still more irritating than usual when members of the audience speak), using visual aids as sensory reactors as well. <br /> <br /> None of the characters acts as expected. (she is not like that flexible victim of "In the Company of Men," not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the general arc of unpredictable history (well, until the last shot, but the hell the audience was waiting for this greeting ) as we move from a modern bustling office to a bustling nightclub to romantic and criminal encounters. There is a parallel story that is thematically redundant and unnecessary but that only gives us a few minutes to catch your breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of the year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on 07/28/2002)
