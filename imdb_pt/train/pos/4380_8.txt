This is an action / drama / and a bit of a very good historical film. <br /> <br /> The basic story is about Rob Roy's Â£ 1000 loan, his theft, and the problems he causes to his family and indirectly. Your clan members. Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an incredible villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and if you look at his face he seems to be able to look away and look completely wicked. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think writers have used the word "honor" 1 many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole film is very well represented and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is thrilling and the swordplay very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> All this is just a bit of a classic.
