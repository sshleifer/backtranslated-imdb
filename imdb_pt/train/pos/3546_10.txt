One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to choose the actors for their talent, not what people could expect. The lighting and the set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I can not imagine). The dialog box is also unique because no contractions are used. The film is very rhythmic, beautifully rendered and interesting from beginning to end. A true joy is MUSIC. A set of first-line songs, from beginning to end, perfectly executed and orchestrated. In addition, the music is very original and memorable, and I think it is superior to many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which may have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of film. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
