Several story lines are interwoven here around different female characters. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. All are transformed at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; His daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is retarded and has a restricted life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a troubled shoe designer and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) lost her husband and now rears the children of her deceased ex-wife. Isabel (Angela Molina) is a bored rich lady. <br /> <br /> Other characters are used to connect the top five female characters. In the narrative, not everything is given at the beginning: some connections are established surprisingly at the end of the film and this increases the experience. The subject of footwear is taken to extremes: for example, when Leire works as a Sapatista and works in a shoe store where he steals his shoes, he breaks one of his heels. <br /> <br /> In editing small links are made between scenes. A phone rings, a cigarette lights, a song, etc. are used to make connection and quick cuts. Frequent plot switching prevents it from being annoying or reaching TV levels. It is strongly music oriented to set the tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as background for the stories, and photos of these cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters. One of the most moving shots is when Anita, who does the same walk every day, widens her walk and restricts the life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main street: how space constraints are visually translated is well done. As with most Spanish films, much narrative is done visually, using soap stories as a simple background. There is a poetic ending that is a bit romantic and sentimental, but it is still beautiful. <br /> <br /> As Ramón Salazar is too passionate for his own material, it is too long. Some scenes are kitschy and on the soap level, including acting (Adela's love life, Isabel's doctor). The theme of the shoe is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is technically more competent, but rather mechanical. This has more the ability to visually translate emotion and atmosphere. After seeing this, you are inclined to move immediately to the new city of the movie: Madrid.
