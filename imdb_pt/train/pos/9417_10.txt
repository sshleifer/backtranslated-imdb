An unpretentious, subtle, dry film, "The Man in the White Suit" is yet another breath of fresh air in film form from Ealing studios. While I suspect that some modern viewers may initially find it obscure, I doubt many will fail to be delighted by how experienced the plot, themes, and characters are languishing during the course of the film. The genuinely great Alec Guinness gives another good characterization in a film, perhaps not as obviously virtuous as Ealing's "Kind Hearts and Coronets" of 1949. This time he simply plays a character instead of eight , but as the inventor and spiritual scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the right tone and expression. Along with Guinness' subtle and expressive performance, the rest of the cast is effective. Of the main players, stand out Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger. Thesiger is incredibly absurd as the crippled but influential business cripple, while Parker is trusted as the ineffective yet crucial parent and owner. Dad, that is, by Joan Greenwood, the clever comedic actress, who is at her peak unsurpassed in this film. Resplendent and seductive in aspect and diction, she is quite sublime in this film, a beautiful contrast to the similarly unusual but more misaligned Guinness. The scene in which she apparently tries to tempt him is so skillfully played by the couple who is both deeply moving and fun ... <br /> <br /> The themes are treated very effectively, without easy morality. The complexities of the relationships between science, business, and the workforce are keenly and appreciably examined. Skillfully directed by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically competent in all areas; evocative photography, sound effects and appropriate music, and a melancholy script all silently impress. A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
