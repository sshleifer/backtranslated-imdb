This movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend. There are laughter in abundance and some uninteresting stories of nudism happening here. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types. The scenery on the Australian coast is simply splendid to see. What a place to visit, to say the least, and one day can become my hiding place. I really like this movie and every time I watch it I like it more. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is a bit mild, this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and your own personal stories.
