Heads, hands and feet - a band from the past, like Strange Fruit. A triple hit there. Those who professed to dislike this movie are heartless or under 40, and have had no experience of the real thing. Sad for them. This is a painfully well-observed little figure which is a great way to spend an hour or two, and probably will not disappear too much on the second display. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the fat drummer (in many ways the loveliest figure of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and vocalist all turn into super performances, and Juliet Aubrey has lovely Eye-popping to go with some sharp acting like Karen, who tries to keep the band together as they spectacularly self-destruct. <br /> <br /> The echoes of Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople before one in all his insolent ridicule, and the script is never tricky for more than a minute. Do not compare this to Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair in all of them. The closest comparison is The Commitments, and this is not bad. And any movie that might evoke memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I do not remember seeing, but the name is still alive - well, it shows that someone on the team knew what it was about. <br /> <br /> A little delight, and thanks for the memory. <br /> <br /> Ah ... and I have another - Stiff Little Fingers; to-a-y what about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS anyone? (You have to see the movie or have been on the road)
