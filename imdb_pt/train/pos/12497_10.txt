If you have not yet watched this movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?!". This is another fantastic and wonderful movie of the fraternal twins we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathtaking (scenery wise)! Clear; as always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main landscape here anyway! Any real fans want it any other way? Of course not! Anyway; is a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it then you just have to go now! I mean now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed!
