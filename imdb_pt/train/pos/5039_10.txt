Impressive. Absolutely stunning. This is a movie about two children that the father suddenly has a vision. He claims that an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill "demons." He gets instructions later, and they begin to gather the demons, who are, with the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax in their heads and cut them, burying them in the rose garden. His father claims that he can see his sins when he touches them. The film continues, with a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is that it perfectly captures the fragility of human perception. Is your dad completely crazy? Or is he telling the truth? The public is left to decide. Go do the trial for yourself and watch the movie. Now.
