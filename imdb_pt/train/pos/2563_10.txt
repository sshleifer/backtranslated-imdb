I saw several comments here about Brando using a Southern accent, some of which felt like a mistake. When this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. The laws of Jim Crow were still in force. Civil rights was in its infancy. Could this have been a subtle social commentary, a southerner in love with a woman of another race? In the same way was MASH a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki appearing "cold." Anyone who has been in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not usually show emotion to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met single women. Americans in Japan were totally foreign to this culture, and direct attempts to meet women were shocking to women. One trait of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many American military took as a sign that their advances were welcome. Recall also that at the time depicted in the film, Japan had just been defeated, and the occupation forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance of what his situation would have been. Watching his interaction with the American actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country. I was able to meet two lovely girls who, after I convinced them that I was not the typical American man, taught me their language and culture during my time in their country.
