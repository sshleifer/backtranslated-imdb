If you like "Othello", you will love this movie, since half of the film revolves around the theatrical production of the play. <br /> <br /> The film has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colman's life while Edmond O'Brien plays the enterprising press agent. <br /> <br /> Some of the supporting players I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell as the gray-haired reporter who finds an angle and Joe Sawyer, the 40's response to Drew. Carey, who plays the policeman on the case. <br /> <br /> Great ruthless moments in this with noir realism everywhere.
