I loved this great movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role in a phenomenal and kind-hearted way. She plays a woman who is taken to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realizes that she is alone. <br /> <br /> So one day, when she's home alone, the stranger invades her house and attacks her again. Not being about to call the police or take him outside, she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprison him in his fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there is need for an alert to the laws of the land. They are very easy on these criminals. It's time for tougher punishments.
