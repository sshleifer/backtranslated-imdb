As if most people no longer had a nervous eye in the field of dentistry, this little film will certainly make paranoid patients squirm. A successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife falling in the pool man (on his everyday birthday!) And fits into a furious collapse. After firing on the head of an attack dog, he enters the work and ends up taking his conjugal aggression to the patients while planning what to do with his wife "slut". There are many word-of-mouth photos, tongue-cutting and beauty queen beauties, as well as a wonderfully disturbed performance of Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he ties his wife before ruthlessly plucking his teeth is definitely hard to watch. A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to get out of the bottom of the pit and this movie surely explains this in detail. "The Dentist" is incredibly fun, fast and ridiculously bloody at times. Check out!
