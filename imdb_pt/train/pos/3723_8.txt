There is an inexhaustible appetite for "basic training" films, so it's surprising that it has had so little attention when first released. It seems likely that you will have a well-deserved second life on DVD / VHS. Tigerland is not uniformly large by any means, there are some terribly clich√©d characters (especially the NCO portrait, makes you stand for the return of Lee's 'Full Metal Jacket' Ermey), but the main performance of Colin Farrell is the material of instant stardom. Charisma to burn and a role that any actor would kill to achieve.
