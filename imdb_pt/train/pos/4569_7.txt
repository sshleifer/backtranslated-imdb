DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does a remarkable job of playing Christy Brown, the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but managed to lead a productive life, coping successfully with her disability, and becoming a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The movie, however, is very difficult to review - or even watch. Fortunately, I had the caption feature to pick up all the spoken words that would have been impossible if I had watched the movie in a theater. Although I respect him as a brave work dealing with difficult subjects, I can not say that it is the kind of film I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my attention was kept. by the storytelling device, a flashback framed by the present, in which we see Christy being honored for her accomplishments before we see the flashback of her youth and her struggles to communicate with those around her, who have surely cared for her. DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), to his mother's fear that, when love is not reciprocated, his heart breaks. There is a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love for her before others and then gets furious after drinking too much. <br /> BRENDA FRICKER does a brilliant job while the mother takes care of him. , his father and a brood of brothers as they struggle to keep a roof over their heads until Day-Lewis begins to succeed with his work. She complements Day-Lewis's performance as the warm hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him. <br /> <br /> Rich and detailed history of a family that stayed together under the most unusual circumstances, with attention to the details of the period in each frame of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis have won the Oscar, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends a lot of time at the local pub, but loves the boy. <br /> <br /> In short: Elmer Bernstein's music is one more factor. It's worth it, but it's definitely not a movie for everyone.
