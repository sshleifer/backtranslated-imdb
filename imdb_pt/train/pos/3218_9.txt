Nine out of ten may seem like a high note for a sci-fi movie that has been smeared at the US box office and highly criticized as the poorest film in Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, when you read negative reviews about this movie, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the homonymous soldier. I'll start here as well, with my astonishing statement that this is possibly the best acting piece I've ever seen in Russell. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffers from intense PTSD - this movie was written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> The picture is on the spot. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety - tied to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every move and interaction with another human being in search of signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper-focus carries with him an inability to comprehend the continuum greater than the tasks he is given to sit in - there is a scene in which he cuts himself chopping carrots and continues to work undisturbed, not cleaning the cut or blood. Many interpret this as a sign of their physical stamina and focus on the work in question, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested routine task - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables he is preparing and the food that will be consumed. Eaten later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is Spartan, to say the least - the two big talk scenes he gets are central to the plot of the film and both underscore the somber nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline tell us. Ever. The fear of keeping him pumped into a state of alert, where the smallest detail will not pass through him, keeping him ready to react on a knife wire. Discipline to keep you under control through your fear, to overcome it and to perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and can not afford the feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of their reaction to the Nielsen Sandra's embrace - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who is only in a hug in combat - the tremor represents him suppressing his instincts of struggle / flight reacting to the fear of being caught, its movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline, in fact. So there is the subtext of their abandonment (twice, in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to throw infantrymen into society's heap of garbage when they have fulfilled their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in HIS this can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace's responsibility for his wife and son - desperately needing a mission, even with a high probability of his death. <br /> <br /> So there's the military subtext as well - the conflict between Busey's Church and HQ star Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Any of them could knock Todd down - but it's not about the tools you have, it's how you use them. An encouraged Todd, given the freedom to exercise his initiative and act without the numbing effect of perceived superiority, uses ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a track in the newest unit - sent without support, coverage, or recognition. It's a reminder that military power can not make up for a failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle themes. When a film is filmed and scripted so minimal, it leaves a lot of space for its own interpretations to take root. Watch the Soldier with an open mind and see what he teaches.
