and laugh out loud funny in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of the movie is well narrated, a story of opposites trying to find a way to outlive each other nearby. <br /> <br /> This is unquestionably Lemmon and Matheau's best film as co-stars, and the interaction between sloppy Oscar and OCD Felix is ​​classic. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Oscar marks a double date, leaves the room briefly, and back to find Felix and the two girls crying is inestimably funny. <br /> <br /> For any fan of smart comedies, The Odd Couple is a "get out of the way" movie.
