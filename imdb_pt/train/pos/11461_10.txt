In addition to the fact that, in all its grandeur, this film surpassed all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrays the excessive use of low quality filters! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a sibling conflict with all there is to it. As usual, a woman agreeing with her true intentions. The ending was as surprising as the murder of Keith Scott by his older brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes in "land of wiking" are exactly as I remember my first time travels. - To be honest, my strong passion for junk movies makes this indispensable in my never ending collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all the people in love with One Tree Hill's most incredible brother cast. . <br /> <br /> -Odin-
