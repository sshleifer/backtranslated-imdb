This movie is the most cult film about metal that exists. Premise: A boy picks up the final recording of his favorite artist, Sammy Curr, who recently died in a hotel fire. He plays backwards and summons him back from the dead to take revenge on behalf of heavy metal in those stragglers who torment him. Any true metal fan will like this movie, and if you're a metal head tormented by athletes, play a Sammy Curr album back ......... no, wait, it's fictional, so get this movie and watch it with the fist in the air, the beating head and the volume at 11!
