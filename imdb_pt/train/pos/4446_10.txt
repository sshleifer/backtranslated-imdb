Yeah, I call that the perfect movie. Not a second boring, a fantastic cast of little-known actresses and actors, a wide variety of well-defined characters with understandable motifs that I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, clear black-and-white photography, soundtrack a clever and harmonious design and an engaging and functional story. It's one of those first-rate photos where all Hollywood pride should rest, the brand that everyone should strive to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing this actress could not do, and she was always easy on the melodramatic side. There were no hysterical blasts with this girl - I always thought she was a better actress than the movie goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time transmitting true feelings. It is fair to add that she also had many good parts during her long career, and this is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits this movie very well. It is about desires, human desires that everyone can understand. In fact, no one seems to be plotting in this movie, all the characters act on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone. The sad fact that this often leads to complications causes dramatic content in which I do not go here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the need to compromise. The movie that most associates with this is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of Doubt, which creates a similarly idealized and at the same time caricatured atmosphere of Small Town America. The story bears some resemblance to Fritz Lang's considerably sterner film, Clash by Night, made a year earlier, where Stanywck starred in a similar part. I can also recommend it.
