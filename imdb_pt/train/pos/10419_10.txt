I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza was the best voice that god had to offer if he could have found the courage to go out to Hollywood and address the opera that he could have been the American Caruso that everyone says could have been, but anyway he is a fantastic introduction to the boneless art form about this and if that's how it's going to be so be. see the movie, you will see why Mr. Lanza is still in discussion, even in my house. Someone says Pavarotti I say MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself when it will be on DVD they must have it restored and VHS is not good enough but this should also be the only Lanza movie put on DVD the others are pretty bad and annoying.
