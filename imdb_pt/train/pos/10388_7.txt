I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this movie. I had a lot more fun than with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's funny to hear people criticize this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's so much cruder than the show." Does anyone remember the rawness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes jokes about incest and Bo says Luke was probably the father of half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned is because it changed to the previous time. <br /> <br /> And about the plot. It was the perfect plot of the Dukes. In fact, as a remake, it probably gets more faithful to the source material than any TV show that migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not EXACTLY similar to their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. I was not too interested in Burt's Boss Hogg. And I would have a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe it's a little ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who did not have a smile on his face while General Lee ran through the streets of Atlanta and Hazzard's back roads? <br /> People, let yourself enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not regret it. It's just a great jerk movie!
