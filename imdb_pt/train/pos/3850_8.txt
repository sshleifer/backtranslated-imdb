This is the last Dutch-language film that Paul Verhoeven did before making Hollywood mainstream movies "Wild Instinct," "Robocop," and "Total Recall," among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider capturing its web before we meet Gerard Reve, a self-centered, boring writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to be the guest speaker at a meeting of the Literary Club in the city by the sea, about an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to have glimpses of how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. Asked if the writers are a little close to insanity, he admits when he reads the newspaper "and says' boom 'I read' disgrace ', when it says' flood' I read 'blood' when it says' red 'I see' dead. "When he tells a story several times, he begins to believe," I lie to you. "He accepts an offer to be the guest of the treasurer of the club, a wealthy hall owner, as he begins to know her and discovers that her husband died, he begins to imagine that she is a "black widow." Is this your most of your reality twisting or is she a murderer? This is a psychological drama and in relating which of those old movies were in my memory, I find that it's my favorite genre.Looking at your body of work, it seems to be Paul Verhoeven's as well, and he's a master at making us question our own understanding of reality.It's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood food. I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that's "stuck".
