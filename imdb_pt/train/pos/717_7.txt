huge fan of Ramones. I like the Ramones, and I suppose if you hate them, then, as well as being an avid Bush supporter, you might not like this classic. <br /> <br /> It is immensely better than the sneaky John Hughes, teen movies and so, plunged the 80s, infinitely better than the American pie that torments us now. <br /> <br /> There are some other great high school films: Sisters Switchblade, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and tacky yet gripping (does not look possible) River's Edge. But RNRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and funniest, and you can stand up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
