"L'Anglaise et le duc", by Erich Rohmer, is a perfect complement to Peter Watkins' La Commune (Paris, 1871). Both films - screened at this year's Toronto International Film Festival - ironically illustrate how the story is shaped by the story's storytellers. Ironic, given the tragic events that were taking place in the US during the festival. Set in Paris during the French Revolution, the film, based on Grace Elliott's "Memoirs" (Lucy Russell), is a firsthand account of how she survived those intoxicating but dangerous days. She also details her relationship with the Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, in contrast to herself, is a supporter of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> True to form, you do not know On what side of history Rohmer will come. One of the first French filmmakers of the "New Wave," Rohmer has been criticized for being too conservative. After all, in the middle of the rebellion-youth-Viet-Nam days of the late 1960s and '70s, he was filming little romantic confections like "Claire's Knee." But do not sell the old man personally, he was always a student of human nature, not an ideologist, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" continues to demonstrate this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never "bad guys" or "good guys"; they are first and foremost human beings capable of displaying a full range of human potentialities and limitations. That's why his films are always provocative and this movie is no exception. Now for the technological bolts and nuts. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, despite reaching the age of 80, is still at the forefront of film innovation. L'Anglaise "is like something you've never seen before.You guessed, the old man - like several of the festival's directors this year - has become digital. <br /> <br /> All the outside scenes of the film look like they are going on in his original Parisian settings of 1780. In fact, you can be so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the look of the movie you're in. I have to go back for a second performance to capture the subtleties of the psychological - political insights. <br /> <br /> Toronto presents some of the world's youngest filmmakers this year as well as some of the world's oldest. <br /> <br /> And the old masters are standing on the edges of the cinema next to the young. /> <br /> Long live the youth.Live old age.And live Long Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
