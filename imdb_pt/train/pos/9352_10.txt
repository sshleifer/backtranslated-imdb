Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It seems like a loss story, when it's actually a story about being alone. Some people may never feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadles' character, Johnson, reflected the total opposite of Sandler's character, Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same light. Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle had the comic role and was a big supporter of Sandler. <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. A very good movie. If you have already lost and felt alone, this movie will ensure that you are not alone. Jerry
