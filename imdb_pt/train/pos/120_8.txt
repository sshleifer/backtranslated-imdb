It is not the task of every film to stimulate it superficially. I will make an ambitious failure on the success of the mass market at any time. Although this really can not be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This indecipherable quality encourages me to watch it again and again. This is a challenging and provocative film that does not involve things. The problem with the movie is in its structure. His inextensible plot seems to be ending, just as a second ending is approached. While everything is technically stunning, the film is just too long for that drive. Leo's late awakening climax comes about 20 minutes late. Great cinematography usually comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the groundbreaking camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. The artifice of composition is provocative and engaging; A character is projected backwards, but his own hand in the foreground is not. The world represented is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes open for a memorable and technically amazing murder that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> The compositions are impressive. Whoever has chosen to release the video tape (out of catalog) in the pan and scan format should never have seen it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is unfathomable how anyone could give this originality a negative critique. You should see it at least once. You have the feeling that von Trier bit more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer for that. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent, in which dishonest Europeans also manipulate an American hoax and several Welles films that take delightful delirium in technique as much as he does. All of von Trier's films explore the naif situation amidst relentless societies. After Zentropa, von Trier moved away from this kind of audacious technical experiment toward dark, overrated, and unclothed breasts like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
