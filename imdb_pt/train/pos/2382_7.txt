For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite episode of 'Star Trek', although in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever'. What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it's tougher than Star Trek with this fascinating story of Trek's current plot. I still think it's quite ingenious how Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, Spock's idea of ​​being court-martialed is clever. You can make holes in the plot if you want. For example, given the Talosian mind control skills and Captain Pike's condition, why is it physically necessary to bring Pike back to the planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... It's best not to think too much about the details and just enjoy the two ST pairs.
