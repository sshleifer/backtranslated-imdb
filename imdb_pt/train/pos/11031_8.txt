Sly is the best action movie. It's a superbly nice movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and direction of Renny Harlins is elegantly assured. Stallone is rarely so interesting in his action movies and he certainly looks like the role in terms of action scenes. This was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and entertaining of the 90's, a definite genre classic. As a fan of Stallone, this is one of which I look back on with good memories. Lots of superb action and Sly in the form of main action man. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all the features that make a good acton movie. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
