I bought the DVD on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail on the head with this. I remember watching the show when I was on TV, but I always wondered what happened to him. Ten years later, it's like watching it all over again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together despite being rivals. Almost representing good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas should be, but suffice it to say that he has some special powers that I do not believe were granted by anything sacred. It can make the phones touch, appear in writing or even cause a change in a person's emotions. Nonetheless, there are a few episodes where he becomes the good guy, though. In short, this is an excellent series that, like many others I can think of (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) were canceled long before their time. Steven King's The Dead Zone seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be doing it. There is nothing more suitable to watch on TV. That's because anything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and should be immediately taken off the TV. So in the meantime, I'll continue to buy DVD players and watch shows that should still be on TV but that were taken off the TV by religious fanatics so we could watch "quality" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons a lots of crap that is).
