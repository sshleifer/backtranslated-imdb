My wife and I have watched this whole series at least three times. I can not imagine how this could be better. This is not the "complete" story of World War II - no library could have this history, but it is the best summary of this story. Lots of details, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the overall picture in view. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is excellent and, of course, superbly given. The interviews are from all sides except the Russian because the producers were not allowed to speak to many Russians. It is well worth having this complete program on DVD. We value our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer does an excellent job of providing photos and actions where there is almost no existing archive: there is almost no movie of trains and submarine battles, for example, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.
