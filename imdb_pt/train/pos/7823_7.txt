An excessive but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the movie is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other, but the second half is not so strong due to the elimination of the character Biko. Still, it's a convincing film with great performances by Kline and Washington in the film that put the last one on the map. Washington was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the first time. Overall, a well done movie that could have been reduced a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
