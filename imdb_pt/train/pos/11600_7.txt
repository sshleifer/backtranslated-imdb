William Hurt may no longer be an idol of American matinee, but he still has great taste in B movie projects. Here he plays a specialist in hazardous waste cleaning with a tragic past trawling a perennial loser on the run - represented by ex -Happy boy Weller - who was tainted with a deadly poison. The actual cute boy Hardy Kruger Jr - possibly cuter than his father - is presented as Weller's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production factory that makes history move. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat crazy government agent looking at the incident that provides unavoidable and high-cheekboned love interest to Hurt's hero. Michael Brandon appears to play a sticky type of not catching prisoners whose surprise you can not wait. The company Coca-Cola wins the Product Placement award in 2000, when the soft drink is presented throughout the production, filmed affectionately on a winter postcard, Hungary.
