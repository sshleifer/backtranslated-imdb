A unique movie ... one of the best of all time. Performance, script, Quincy Jones score, cinematography, editing, etc. - simply amazing. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas family of farmers (the clutters) by a young couple during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team chasing them. Scott Wilson as Dick Hickock is amazing. Arrogant, restless and devoid of compassion, he reveals himself so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well - solitary and at the same time empathic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into an individual and make us buy it? It does and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how the intersection of these two sociopathic individuals was necessary to create critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work wonderfully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that means period of acting. <br /> <br /> The cops are wonderful, too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary films, where producers find it necessary to endow the police with superhuman assets or weaknesses, these are only genuine flat feet, working the case with determination and competence. They look so real. I've never seen cops on screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics coming back. Really one of a kind in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie is unique because you already know what happened, but I'm alerting you to the disc). <br /> <br /> Of course the best scenes from the best crime programs and films are interrogations - the intellectual fencing games between cops and bad guys, Mano a Mano. This movie has the best interrogation scenes you'll see in the movie. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff and unravel slowly, unaware that the cops have the goods in them. But the police need to expertly prepare their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully provoke confessions. This is one of the best performances you have ever seen. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and horrible angles of this true story, the ICB was filmed at Clutter's house, and I heard the Clutters were played by film students to give a genuine feel. It works. These seem to be decent and simple people. This makes crime so palpable and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. It's not a well-being movie, but it's one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's the must-see for all movie buffs.
