I'm not sure I've understood where all these enthusiastically anti-grudge people are talking about here, maybe it's just that some people like to complain about things. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly imperfect (unequal performance, some may have had difficulties with time changes, actors all very willing to go to places I really prefer not to go, etc.), but IMHO had some things that more than offset the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First of all, I loved the 'breaking the rules' bit. NORMALLY, when you leave the haunted house, the villains leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the mysterious symbolic paranormal type. NORMALLY (spoiler alert) when you are hiding under the covers, they can only get through that little opening you see. NORMALLY in the end the ghosts have somehow become less scary because you have discovered that they are just misunderstood, or that they have been released, or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, production was exceptional. While the film had no special effects, the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done. Probably not the best kind of movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the best kind of terror (nothing against them, they have their place) but great for those who started considering the conventions as guaranteed and have no problems with the distortions of time.
