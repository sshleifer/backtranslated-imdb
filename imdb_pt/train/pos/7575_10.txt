Resident Evil: Code Veronica is a great video game well done, has great graphics, very comfortable controls, a great plot and a high factor of fun. The plot for this is that Claire Redfield is taken to an island for trespassing on Umbrella, and the graphics are very good, the effects of fire and rain are great. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not fit Dreamcast's control, making it difficult to use. for it's still fun to go around some weird disturbing place by tossing the bowels of zombies. Code: veronica also has a bit of "Romance" between the two main characters. You also get to play as Chris Redfield of Resident Evil 1 The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, even though I hate the new feature, when the giant spiders crawl, their feet make a disturbing sound, and the weapons sound more realistic. history, comfortable controls and reali stic sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica a sweetheart. I give 10 out of 10.
