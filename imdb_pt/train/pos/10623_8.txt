Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who was terribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous and abusive alcoholic stepfather Barry (a genuinely scary portrait of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fiance (sweetly played by Linda Tracee Newberry) and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue. Haunted by his dark past, instigated by the bald, radiating Jack the Demon (a truly scary Michael Robert Brandon), and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother, Eric leaves the bottom of the well and embarks on a brutal murder binge. Capably directed by Kallio (who also wrote the astute script), with very uniform performance of an unnamed cast (Jeff Steiger is especially good as Eric's useful guardian angel, Michael), rather rough, but polished general cinematography by George Lieber, believable and credible characters, shaking out explosions of raw, shocking and inflexibly fierce violence, a moody and scary Dan Kolton score, an uncompromising and daunting end, dirty places in Detroit, Michigan, a severely serious tone and a tone keyed up. Exciting narration that remains in a constant range throughout, this extremely powerful and brave psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing. A real sleeper.
