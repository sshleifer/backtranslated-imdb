When the United States entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to produce propaganda films. The SMALL American is probably the best of them all, because it stars Mary Pickford. Pickford portrays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but his decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist. <br /> <br /> When the ship on which Pickford is sailing is sunk by the Germans (think of Lusitania) because it is carrying ammunition, Pickford has a great scene as a lifeguard and shouts at the German commander. Later, of course, she encounters Holt and Hatton when she is being held prisoner of war in a castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille offers a truly great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt is wandering through a bombed village. They pass through a destroyed church from which only one wall remains standing. Against the wall is a very large crucifix. As they stand and watch, the wall crumbles, but the figure of Jesus remains suspended in the air. It's a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very direct and not artistic. <br /> <br /> Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. She has always been a very natural actress who avoided the histrionics by waving many other actors of the day used. She is also very beautiful. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is fine. Among the list of actor names in "extras" are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> It's not a big movie, but interesting to see US propaganda at work.
