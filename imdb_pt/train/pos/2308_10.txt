I checked this as a boost while browsing the movie shop and could not have been more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not the typical "girl movie" with a sentimental love story and tears all the time, but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist in the end. It is an ending in which, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not harmed by it. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress, even in this movie, her debut, and it's definitely worth watching! I did not recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important roles well. "The Man on the Moon" is such a believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time. Most women can definitely relate to everything - from the words of Witherspoon, their subtle looks and their not-so-subtle (infuriated like the typical teenager) emotions. While she is playing a confused character about love, she does not look silly and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies nowadays.
