Barriers seems to be one of those series that were lost in the mists of time. After its transmission in the early 80's and a repeat, it's since sank without a trace. This is a shame. <br /> <br /> Originally I saw this when it was aired on the south side of the TV on Sunday afternoons and was a classic tea time display. Although I do not remember much of the program, a few things went through my mind. The most notable were the unforgettable titles. The melancholy flute music accompanying the attempt to escape through an Eastern European border and the subsequent car accident (and this scene left me with a permanent love for Mercedes 'fintail' models when they used a Merc 200). Although it was not obvious at first, the solution to the mystery of the series was in these titles. The plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers that many twists were adopted but Barriers was a surprisingly "adult" children's drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame he did not do much else. <br /> <br /> This was a quality drama, well overdue for a DVD release and I hope I get the chance to get back to familiarizing myself with it in the future. <br /> <br /> A memory of my childhood
