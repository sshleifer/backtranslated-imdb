Excellent 1943 film, with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar-caliber performance as head of his family, bringing them back to America as the Nazi threat deepened. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any 1943 film. Invoking treachery around them, Lukas deals with the situation successfully. He knows he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return. <br /> <br /> Davis once again pulls out all the stops with a spill of tears like Katharine Hepburn when they need to break up. Resolutely, she knows that her eldest son must follow him on his way to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a perverse enemy.
