This definitely is not the intellectual movie with deep mission, so I really do not think there is much to not understand, in case you are not Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. The humor is simple, very funny and sometimes, perhaps, not very morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so are the authors. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and these two films should not be compared that way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to teach you a lesson, she'll try to make you laugh and there's a chance she's successful. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, nor an ingenious one, but I liked it. . Some scenes are really worth seeing.
