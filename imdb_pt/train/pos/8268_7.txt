This is apparently the second remake of this movie, having been shot before in 1911 and 1918. And in many ways, this reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films relate to a stubborn arrogant who comes to one of the best schools in the world and both ultimately show the blow slowly learning about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And in a supporting role is Jack Pickford - always remembered as the brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford comes out the best, as the sympathetic loser who befriends Tom - he really does have some decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard cliches are there and the film, because it has been done so many times before and after, offers few surprises. However, it is a nice film and it is a nice sight. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better and quieter college film, try Harold Lloyd's movie, THE FRESHMAN - his football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is much nicer and nicer than annoying Tom Brown. FRESHMAN is probably the best college photo you can find of that time. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a minor picture is that William Haines essentially played the same unlikely and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others) - and if You've seen one of these movies, you've seen them all. Well done, but certainly not original! And, because it's just a replay of your other movies, anyone giving the film a grade of 10 is strongly advised to watch these other movies. <br/> <br/> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the most rated movie of the IMDb since 1920 !! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films - as this movie may be number one, nobody knows.
