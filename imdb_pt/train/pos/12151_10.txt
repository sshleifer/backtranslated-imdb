This is simply the epitome of what a TV movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, when my wife and I were in college, we came across this. The action is tacky. The script is poorly written. The good old boys. The ridiculous, but somehow obvious, cliche and banal premise. The riding in pickup trucks with his corpse of woman supported. It has everything. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: gold digger stallion, stupid rich kid who wants to do it on his own, best-friends-who know best, but direct absent son. And the wife's corpse. Supported. In a pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Several things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies" since we have seen this beauty. Everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.
