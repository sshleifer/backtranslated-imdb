The question of whether or not one likes this cinematic version of "The Ghost Train" invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone: ​​its reaction to Arthur Askey's performance. <br /> <br /> He tends to steal almost every scene he is in, and not always on a good path. Sometimes you would like him to settle down or back down a bit, to allow plot characters to appear and develop (which they do to some extent). But somehow everything still points to Askey's character Tommy Gander. <br /> <br /> Personally I like the movie, and I even like Askey to some degree. I always seem to put it on the VCR in those strange hours of the morning when I can not sleep and really can not find the energy to watch anything else. There is something about watching old movies b / w in the dark and quiet of before dawn that I find attractive ....
