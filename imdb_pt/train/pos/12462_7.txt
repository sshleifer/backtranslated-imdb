Noni Hazlehurst's performance on a power tour (which earned him an AFI award) is at the same level as his effort at FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's daughter, and Michael Caton (better known as THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Interestingly, Hazlehurst is currently the host of the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS lifestyle program, and Caton is the host of property-type programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc ...) This film reaffirms the popular belief that Noni was arguably the leading female actor in Australia during the early 1980s. Classification: 79/100.
