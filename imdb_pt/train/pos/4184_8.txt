Some war movies succeed where others do not, and this can be judged from various angles. The humanistic angle in which you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the camaraderie among the soldiers, the arduous trials that people face within themselves when in combat, etc.) are always films that I find attractive. Films like Das Boot and Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies that you feel a connection to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is also successful. He speaks of "the highest honor" and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they were honored and recognized in a way totally incompatible with Western thinking, but it is, until the end, a true history of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on true story.
