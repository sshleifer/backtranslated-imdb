This is my all time favorite movie, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever. Not to mention that this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; as I'm putting all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose, because of that, he'll always have a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr * p, but I'm a woman, so get over it) in this whole movie gets an 8/10 of me. The choreography was excellent and also the fact that Lucille Ball is even more incredible.
