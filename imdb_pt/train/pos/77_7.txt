The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his performance as a magician. However, the middle of the very successful show, the police come and close it. It seems that his former boss had tricked him with the tricks that Price had created-even the ones he did in his own time at home. As a result, the price justifiably kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Price killed and probably thought this was a good thing, because Price was a little crazy, he just could not stop at one (like eating Lay's chips). <br /> <br /> The movie was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great twists as well as thrilling action. One thing you can not say about this movie is that it's annoying. Although it is also far from subtle, it is fun and will be worth it. If I had never seen Vincent Price's CASA da Cera version, I would probably have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN much more and scored 8 or 9. That's because although THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie, remembers much the film that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was re-hashed in the next movie. Both were made in 3-D, both have a plot where Price has all the justifications to kill, but he can not stop once he has committed the first and both are very fun to watch. The biggest differences, and they are few, are that the HOUSE OF WAX was colorful and it was more a horror movie, and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie. AND WAX HOUSE (Price version only). Both are great horror movies from the 1950s.
