This is the most confrontational documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple, breathtaking sight of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centered on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore. Taking no political side, this film is a neutral moving image of the realities that our Western societies choose not to educate us - the by-products of economic growth, the externalities paid by the citizens of less developed communities, the source of our comforts and the waste of our consumer lifestyles. Incredible, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey but worth a run - please stop being ignorant and at least see these photos of the truth without feeling any pressure to position yourself on these issues. 10/10 definitely!
