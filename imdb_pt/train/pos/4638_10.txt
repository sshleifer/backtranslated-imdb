I saw this movie when I was in Israel in the summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so the captions were very useful, I did not feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie surprised me !!!!!! It represents two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter the two domains of the conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions involved. The film culminates in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to an extremist side! an absolute must see !!
