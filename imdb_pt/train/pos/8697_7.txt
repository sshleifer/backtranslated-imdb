Often laughing loudly at funny jokes about sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills make more code laughter than it's been seen since the days of Grandma and Jed Clampett. Plot focuses on two drivers who bet on which of them can go to their employer (both single and soon to be single, very sexy - Bisset and Woronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will pay his debt to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play from below to his friend! <br /> <br /> Many daring dialogues, very sick physical humor, etc. But much of the comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual member of the family who ends up taking his sexy niece and teenager on a one-year "mission trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Hilarious fun.
