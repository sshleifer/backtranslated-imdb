To enjoy this movie more, you must be a) strongly in love (without a marriage) b) recognize the English humor that is about admiring gallant and spirited situations in life and not just running jokes c) be quite intelligent, because the authors gave a opportunity to laugh and cry every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements "b" and "c", you can recognize and enjoy the author's contribution. d) to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like Kirsted Dunst who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) you should admire creative, slightly melancholy people with great and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements you will probably rate this film close to 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laugh half (!) As much as watching this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry while laughing in a few moments (I always feel sensitive, whenever good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
