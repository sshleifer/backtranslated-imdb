This is a good movie, although people unfamiliar with Modesty's Blaise comics and books might find it a bit slow and action-free. For the fan of Modesty, the film will be very enjoyable, particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the "story" Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is listed as a "Creative Advisor" and the filmmakers must have paid attention to him as the story follows closely the details that have been presented in comic books over the years {though events have been remodeled for modern days). The only thing the true fan might find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie is again being true to the chronology of Modesty Blaise, since the film happens in the beginnings of the race of Modesty. Alexandra Staden makes a very credible young Modesty that looks a lot like Modesty. A welcome change from Monica Vitti's Modesty portrait farce.
