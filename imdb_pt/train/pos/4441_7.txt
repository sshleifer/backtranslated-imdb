Okay, before we review, I have to ask: why is this not listed individually? It may have been just a TV item in Italy, but for Lamberto Bava's international fans this is his own film. In America this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "Demons" plus a cast member and staff. But yes, I personally was annoyed because this was so hard to find on this site that it is so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review "The Ogre". I've seen the trailer for this many times on YouTube and honestly found it quite scary. The movie itself (it's the size of the feature, so becoming a movie) has many strong parts and manages to scare. I was displeased with the last act, but overall I do not regret buying the DVD before seeing it (available on the Shriek Show). I think the origins of the TV in the movie explain the last act. I will not give any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit familiar: an American horror writer who is vacationing in a scary old castle with husband and son only to find that it resembles exactly the setting of his childhood nightmares. There are weak echoes of "The Enlightened One," but this is a different brand of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is the true living place of her nightmares, but her husband does not believe her. The atmosphere and the terror follow. <br /> <br /> The multiple nightmare sequences were pretty weird. The Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a bit of the resurrection of Uncle Frank's first "Hellraiser". There are also some good shocks and a well made underwater scene. I give them support that the film never bent to imitate American films with similar concepts, like "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "The Ogre" is an original. And the monster itself was scary when presented correctly. <br /> <br /> In the DVD of the Shriek Show, there is an interview by Lambert Bava in which he takes care to mention that this is not part of his classic "Demons" series. It also gives a lot of credit to the royal castle in which the film was filmed. In fact, this setting contributes a lot to the movie. The music of Simon Boswell also helps. <br /> <br /> There are many good things here. "The Ogre" is not perfect but well worth seeing. Tome is a minor achievement of Lamberto Bava.
