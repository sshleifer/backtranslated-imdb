This series could well be Britcom's best ever, and that's saying a lot, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name just two). <br /> <br /> What made butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it not only exemplifies classic comedy, elegant and intelligent, but also expanded horizons, reflecting - seamlessly, gently and in all the details - the great social change that was taking place in Britain in time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this show as a teenager and being amazed at everything about it. The lifestyle represented was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I've seen real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was a far cry from the 1970s costume still seen in North America at the time. Then there were the decorations, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the lay children, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. They were examples of the "New Europeans" who would have an impact on life and style around the world in the next decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone living the suburban dream could be so discontented and restless was revolutionary, particularly for Americans, for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (the situation was portrayed in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie Montenegro). And if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. A potential subject that was not really about sex, or even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people beating their foreheads in disbelief ... at the time, anyway. <br /> <br /> Butterflies have revealed themselves - in many ways - prophetic. He documented ahead of his time postmodern boredom, the omnipresent lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and the generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed to perfection by tense father-son relationships). It is a pity that this series has not been rediscovered on a large scale, and everyone involved received credit for creating a meaningful image of a certain time and place, and predicting all the scarcity and anguish that was to come.
