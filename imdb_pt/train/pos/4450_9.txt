An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wanders through the forest to witness a murder, but has he seen the murder or is he losing his mind? Is he just getting old? The movie is great because the viewer has to decide on what's going on. There is very little dialogue in this movie, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was happening and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The other part that I liked were the photos of the forest in late fall and winter. Those were beautiful, but the only thing I did not like was the old man's underwear. He could have tied the robe a little tighter, but other than that, it was a very deep film.
