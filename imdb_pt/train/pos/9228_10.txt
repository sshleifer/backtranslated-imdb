Hoping to see another Nunsploitation movie with a Mother Superior abusing and torturing her accusations, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated. <br /> <br /> In fact, it has a feminist plot, although I do not think such a term existed at the time the film is set. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very oppressed and locked up in subaltern places in society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she simply can not sit there anymore and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young teenager near a battlefield. She sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before she can, her hate-filled father decapitates the soldier and nods his head (big family dynamics, huh?). After that, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Although scenes involve violence, rape, and nuns, I would consider it more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of the ingredients for a useless exploration piece are there, but acting, camera work, plot and music are too good to keep you at that level. Most of the "nuns" movies I've seen usually have the basic premise: a good girl ends up in a convent, where Mother Superior is a supreme bitch who likes to whip people and / or make their lives hell. Flavia passes much of the first part of the film passively questioning all the atrocities that happen around him. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes familiar with the strong (but a little crazy - she likes to pee outside like me, but it's so much easier for the boys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not shrink in fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their deliverers (of the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, who impales the beloved sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is the death of Agatha who sends Flavia in her violent crusade against those who oppress her ... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover abandons her at a very inopportune moment. I do not want to give much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. This is a great movie so do not be intimidated by its reputation (not deserved) as an epic garbage. Also, how could a film with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I'm not familiar with the other works of María Casares, but Sister Agatha is a hellish character. <br /> <br /> I've read many good reviews of Synapse's (USA) release, but I love my German X- rated copy of Kult DVD. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but it actually has a bit more information on all edges than the Synapse release. <br /> <br /> And there are also many lines of great, wise or funny dialogue (many of Sister Agatha's) <br /> <br /> "Why is God male? The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit "They're all males!" -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid, look at them, Sister - Afraid that their power will be taken from them!" -Sr. Agatha (about the Christians fleeing after the Muslims arrive) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Muslims can not do anything for you that Christians did not do! Ha Ha Ha!" -Sr. Agatha (for a group of Christian women on the run) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless these Muslims - For putting fear in these pompous Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Does it only take the sight of a Muslim to make you your underwear?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a fugitive nun. The idea for the film came from events that occurred during the invasions of Musalman in Italy , culminating in what until now is remembered as the MARTÍRIO OF THE 800 IN THE OTRANTO "
