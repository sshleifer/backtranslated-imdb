Okay, the recent history of Star Trek was not good. The Next Generation faded in its last seasons, the DS9 bravely stayed where no one had stayed before, and Voyager started very badly and never fulfilled its promise. So when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But overall, it was a solid Trek material and a good joke. <br /> <br /> I'll take the nits out of the way first. The opening theme is monotonous and I'm not looking forward to watching it regularly, but that's what I'm remote about. What was really bad was the completely free lotion scrub scene that pretty much drove my wife out of the room. They need to cut that nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and moved well. The characters, though still new, seem well rounded and not always what you would expect. Vulcans are clearly being presented in a very different way than before, with a somewhat sinister theme. I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first character in Star Trek not to be able to be proud in the face of death, but has to deal with his phobias and fears. They seemed to remain true to the Trek tradition, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like filming shields, instant invention of technology that fixes anything, and the inevitable infinity of travel stories in the time. Does anyone want to start a pool in how long before Borg appears? <br /> <br /> In short, the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with new eyes. We get a chance to learn how things went as they were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from insults to war? How do we know the Romulans? How did the Federation graduate and who put the Earth in charge? Why is the main policy so important? If they approach these things instead of spitting travel episodes over time, this will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite quote: Zephram Cochran saying "where no man went before" (not "nobody")
