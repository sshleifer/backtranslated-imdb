'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is no romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She does not love him, but he is a sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not talked to each other for five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly to each other. <br /> <br /> As this story and love stories of parents, Loretta's aunt and uncle develop, is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every visa is a delight to watch, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really earned the Oscar that year. Cage is very good, and goofy too, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are great. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
