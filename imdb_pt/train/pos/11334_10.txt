I would say that this film gives insight into the trauma a young mind can face when a family is torn apart by divorce or other disaster. I recommend this movie especially for parents or people planning to have a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters attractive and highly friendly of a myriad of dimensions. Scary monster, though probably not scary for most adults, has a very real clue as to what the overactive imagination of a child facing unfamiliar terrors can create. <br /> <br /> I found the movie delicious!
