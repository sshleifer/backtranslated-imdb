Outrage is a very good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the role! It's hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I watched this, I thought why they have to do all these things. Not right, but they learned their lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anyway, if you see this movie on TV, watch why it's good!
