Ghost Story (the TV movie - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The film was well written and well played and, I thought, when the TV season of 1972-73 began, if the TV series is as good as the movie, NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie were available on video !!) The series was a colossal disappointment - even with William Castle as an executive. producer. If, however, you get the chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, take a look. You will not be disappointed.
