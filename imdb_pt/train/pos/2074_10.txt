Another great channel 4 canned just before time. Compelling performance by Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and fun. I remember watching it at the time and even then, wondering around, no one had really heard of it. But trying to find someone now who can remember that is even more difficult. Maybe Channel 4 will not do its job well enough to garner the enthusiasm it needs. Either that or the general public is very interested in TV vomit which is Big Brother. I suspect the latter. Garth Merengie's Dark Place download led Channel 4 to release a DVD of that series. Let's hope the same can happen with North Square.
