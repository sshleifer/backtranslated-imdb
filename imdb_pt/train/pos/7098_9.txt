"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An excellent script, a sustained rhythm, intelligent dialogues that are sometimes ironic. In addition, he had a good nose on the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Willis distinguishes himself from the type of character he used to play in his previous films. Here, a tired and hopeless character you could name a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case in "Die Hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of the time. The film contains a very exciting ending as well. It has real dramatic power. But this fantastic film is also a reflection on man, the dangers he fears (especially those that can cause the end of the world and here are viruses that can create diseases). No matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated in their real value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
