*** SPOILERS *** This film always seems very exaggerated, until I remember that my university campus had a former student who became a Nazi racist murderer and who committed suicide too: his His name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Look it up on Wikipedia - I've added some pictures to their article about it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but these things really do happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
