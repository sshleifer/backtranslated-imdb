Jörg Buttgereit goes a little too far with his films and themes sometimes, even to my liking, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically made, with a deeper meaning for their themes as well. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this movie. It's not really a movie with a story, in the sense of having a beginning, middle and end. He also does not have a main character, but focuses on 7 different murders and murders in 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are being told with much class, although some of them are, of course. more 'interesting' and realistic than the others. They are not necessarily connected, but together they still tell a story. The film does not look disjointed. All different stories have a different feel and Buttgereit tells the story without using any words (also typical of his style), but instead allows the characters' obvious and sensitive images and emotions to tell the whole story. This helps make this movie an effective movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, the production values ​​are not too high and this may be something that may astonish some people. However, it helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> A Buttgereit movie that I 'enjoyed' watching. <br /> 7/10
