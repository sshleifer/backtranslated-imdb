I really liked this movie. Many Koreans will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. The cinematography was average. The film would have been better if the angel or camera movement was more erratic. Editing, however, was very cool and unusual. <br /> <br /> The performance was also very good. Kim Ha Neul used to play an innocent and weak girl in Korean soap-opaeras. But this time, she plays a cute little fellow very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his very convincing role. <br /> <br /> What I like the most about this film is that the emotion of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that the characters weep in the river before the audience and I always thought it was very old. There was no such crap in this movie. Very funny and well done.
