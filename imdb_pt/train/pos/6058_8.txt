This is a well-made documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car racing. The photograph is simply excellent. The scene was Mario Andretti drives the old racing roadster down New England street, lined with old maples, leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car, it's amazing. The movie loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you enjoy watching cars driven to your limit, you should see this movie.
