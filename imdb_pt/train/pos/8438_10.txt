HLOTS was a remarkable series, it's what NYPD Blue will never be, in HLOTS the plots are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, folding all the loose ends, it was nice to have everyone back together, even some who passed away appeared (will not tell how) The plot was fast, emotional and full of spirit the series had week and week out. Homicide, Life on the Streets, network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Thumbs UP and all that. Thanks NBC for giving us the Finally, we did not get it!
