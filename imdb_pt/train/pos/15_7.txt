I think if a movie has magic, I do not need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, but they do not detract from the overall positive impact of watching people helping each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to solve. Both characters are clever. However, Stanley can not understand enough to work because he can not read; he can not read because he had a lot of adventure in his childhood. Iris, though well-educated, did not have enough adventure and so can not understand how to overcome the turnaround that her life took. In both flaws and strengths, the characters complement each other. It may be a little difficult to accept that an Iris would end up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other job that paid better. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of history, their unfolding seems a bit planned. I assume no one has had time to rethink the script. Still, it's a good movie, imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on the screen if anyone had!
