This first film has its flaws - a predictable plot and some dubiously relevant scenes - but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery over editing and using powerful images. He is also one of the most expressionist of his films stylistically; Observe, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the sequence of the group and the frequent echoes of the title and plot in the pictures. <br /> <br /> Its core, however, remains the final match, which is still among the most exciting examples of boxing. Even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and his wife's move from the champion's corner to yours, motivating the final payment of the plot, is very well intertwined with the progress of the hero. match. The timer inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even if it's a silent movie, the visuals usually have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). The rhythm becomes astonishingly fast, and the viewer is sucked in by the excitement and brutality of the game and underlying sexual jealousy. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I'm familiar with is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As in every silent Hitchcock they released, they attached several musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is often sloppy, and the sound quality varies a lot, but some genuine care seems to have gone for most of the actual choices, and the music that accompanies the final play works very well; it is unlikely that this sequence will be better accompanied by what it is here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive film than the current obscurity would suggest. It deserves a place of honor in both the Hitchcock canon and the slim list of worthy boxing movies.
