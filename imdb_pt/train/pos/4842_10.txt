If the very thought of Arthur Askey twists his guts, do not worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, as the equally wonderful Back Room Boy, is a movie that is simply too good to be sunk by a single performance, even than the main actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe it's because I come into your world instead of waiting for it to come to mine, which is a mistake many people make. The Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you could not watch it without being amazed at the deep, dark world to which it transports you, it is immersive in a way that few cheap, cheerful boatmen managed to be during the desperate start. 40's and it's a movie I imagine few people have ever seen just once. The cast is, without exception, extraordinarily good, perhaps Linden Travers leaves it a little thick, but against the backdrop of a solitary railway station in wartime, it could hardly play badly and not stand out. The sad passage of the lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible movie and now it's really in the past, but wait patiently for us to push the game.
