This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart. So many years I waited to see this eternal story! I was not ready, maybe. It is possible that my sensibilities have not appreciated his power. So now I thank my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI has been long. Its now a legendary luminescence. But now I have finally discovered the invaluable gifts of the splendid talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can talk like hers? Some have said that it was forged from their years of silence, and this pit could have been just her speech, is quite eloquent when given a chance. She widely deserved her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film is in an epic in the most classic proportions. All parts equal, necessary and perfect. Pessimists may withdraw if they wish, but they would be avoiding a narrative that remains with one for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> GOOD GOOD EARTH enriches the person in ways that are not expected. But not everything will come from this with the joy that I did. But I just hope this movie is remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not stimulate me with technical details about the race of top players. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with absolute perfection. But I dare a million new films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such poignancy, power, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dares to re-film this masterpiece, I will warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance that still emanates from the heart of this story. Time will not diminish this effort nor progress to improve its greatness.
