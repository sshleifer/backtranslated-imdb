Sharp, well-made documentary focused on Mardi Gras beads. I have always liked this approach to making movies - communicating ideas about a larger, more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon, dividing the issue into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I am sure most people have heard stories about clandestine workshops and we understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and the effect of globalism on the poorer nations (no matter how much people feel about it). Rather than exposing these subjects and getting up on a podium (not that there is anything wrong with this, in addition to documentaries typically preach to converts), this documentary simply shows carnival accounts, how they are made, why people and under what conditions, and then how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. It investigates openly and clearly the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers, and ultimately the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little disgusted with that. ; also by the Mardi Gras revelers, but also by how workers in China have accepted their status as normal and equal to the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are administered). The images of the street sweepers, clearing the beads from the streets at the end, made a special impression. But that was only my reaction; I can see how someone can read this documentary in a slightly different way. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I do not think you have to have a specific political opinion to be affected by it. Ultimately, it is a story about human beings and our relationship to the goods we produce and consume. If you have already bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Excellent and highly recommended. You need to see more documentaries like this. Many compliments to all those involved in the making of this film.
