I had few problems with this movie and heard a lot of criticism saying that it is excessive and overrated. It is true that it lasts for more than three hours, but I was struck by the fact that it passed so quickly. I do not think it's overrated, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction of James Cameron rarely escapes the focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is as beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals all the scenes in which he is. The story is very rich in detail, and is warm in the development of the character, obvious with the love story that is very touching when it needs to be, although in the first part of the story. movie is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely fascinating, and I confess I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I'll also say that the last five minutes were very touching. The James Horner score was lovely, although I've never been a big fan of the song My Heart Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered underdeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give the Titanic a 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
