This is one of my favorite kung fu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers of the late 70's. The plot is interesting and winding, the characters are cool each with their own style - frog, snake, lizard etc. . The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venom movies, but what's interesting is there with different styles of kung-fu showing the various characters. I recommend this movie to those who think that all Shaw Brothers films, especially those of Chang Cheh, are the same, most of their films usually focus on the 10 Tigers and Shaolin vs. Manchu conflicts. This film is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
