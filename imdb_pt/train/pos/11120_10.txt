Wow. I loved the whole series and was shocked by the comments from people who thought this went awry. It may have a bit of a difference in seasons 4 and 5, staying better than anything else on television. But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations in the themes developed in the first three more muscular seasons. 6B began with such a somber mood and Janice always insightful about the family's anguish - that phrase full of misfortune about knowing Tony's propensity to sit and face. Anyone who has lost the implications of this for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort about psychiatric study and his references to sociopath self-delusional sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the early episodes of the series, say, Tony's panic attack on the ducks leaving his pool and resonating with the Phil's wave. bye "line to his grandchildren before the mercy blow of the final episode (not to get into Chase's black humor). <br /> <br /> I could go on and on but I'll just add that I thought the show final - starting with the initial varieties of Vanilla Fudge to fuel the ironic shadow ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") in the final moments when Tony fades into complacency with his family in tow or blasts like AJ's SUV or Phil's head were the best TV of all. <br /> <br /> Very good in an agonizing environment that pathologically provides the "fuck fantasies" that AJ ridicules (and then which he promptly disappears). from the pork pie to Mr. Chase.
