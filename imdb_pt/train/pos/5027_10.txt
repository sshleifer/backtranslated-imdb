I gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors And my God the exciting! The problem is that I do not want to tell anyone about the acting or the story, because that will ruin the movie. But I recommend you go straight to your nearest moviestore now and rent it! (Do not forget popcorn!)
