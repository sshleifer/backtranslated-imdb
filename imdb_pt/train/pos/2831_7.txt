I stumbled into this movie when I was selling eBay's Caesars Palace, since I'm in love with its rich history in Las Vegas as the last of the original luxury resorts still in good condition (unless you count Bally's, the original MGM Grand). In this aspect, this film offers full strength. You get a grand tour of the Caesars estate, which, despite all the renovations and additions you have made over the 40 years it has been open, seems dauntingly similar. As a movie in general, the plot is a bit difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrendous editing. And when I say horrible, I do not use that word lightly. There are a lot of small stretches of Las Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene in which character Robert Drivas is talking to his father about how much he grew up, and without any explanation, he (Drivas) goes (in those fragments of infamy) from being himself, to a baby, to a little boy, and then back to himself as he talked back and forth with his father. (That does not reveal details of the plot, if there is anything, one can be prepared for it and maybe they will not be as amazed as I was at the editing.) The film has aged well, otherwise, and has a good message about the differences inherent between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some fashion or fashion.
