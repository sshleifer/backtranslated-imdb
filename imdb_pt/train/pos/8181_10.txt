Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a swimming pool. Suddenly he discovers that his wife is going out with the pool attendant - he realizes that behind everything clean there is decay. He begins to torture his patients. ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the demented dentist - he is completely believable. There is surprisingly little blood, but the scenes of dental torture are quite unpleasant and grotesque. Highly recommended. "The Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
