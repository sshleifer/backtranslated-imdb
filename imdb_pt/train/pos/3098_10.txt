I loved this show so much and I am so incredibly sad that it was canceled, I thought I would go back too but only two stupid weeks. That is terrible. I hate how we never figure out how everyone else ends. sucks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and everything, but it does not give time for good ones like Six Degrees. If they are complaining about the ratings, it was probably because they had a bad seat because this was a really good show, something I could relate to and anticipate. JJ Abrams delivered, he's amazing, I wish ABC could trust him enough to complete the story. I loved the whole cast as well. I could not wait to see how one day they would all come together. Everyone's story is now left incomplete, now I'll never know if Steven and Whitney would get together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura, Damien, and everyone else. This is really so bad.
