This is the best and most original show seen in years. The more I watch, the more I fall in love with it. The cast is great, the writing is great. I personally like all the characters. However, there is a favorite character for everyone, as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds as in real life. I believe ABC has done a disservice to writers, actors, and the potential audience of this program, to cancel so quickly and not announce enough, nor give a real chance to win followers. There are so few programs that I watch more, since most of the TV is horrible. This show, in my opinion, was there with my favorite Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience of Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they knew that. Why it is always the loser who gains so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential are always discarded immediately. I'm so sick of reality shows that I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then hire excellent actors, this show was very promising. The recent episode was the best of all, as everyone started really getting involved and making the show so real. Please watch this show on the ABC video and let ABC know that you want to have this program back. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO THE ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
