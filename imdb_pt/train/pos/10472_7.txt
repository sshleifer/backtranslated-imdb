Anyone who loves Rheostat music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, mostly about the pace and cast of certain actors (not Maury) who are not really convincing in their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or want to watch this movie as presented CBC television in Canada: The version that airs is the CBC is like the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- do not watch it. Cut entire scenes and subplots (if you can) from the movie. CBC, which features most of the untouched movies, took half the courage of WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's horrible what they did with the movie. Rent the video or watch a movie, but do not watch it on CBC.
