This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme that the film intends to convey. One phrase that keeps popping up in my mind is that "history repeats itself." Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have all the excuses not to share the most dear time with their children until it's too late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they are prone to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if your heart is filled with love for your loved one; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and it is never too late to talk to their parents about what they feel deep in their hearts in order to get a better understanding of each other so that when life To end someday, people should not feel sorry or regret once they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They fully understood the director's intent. The charm of the film is, to me, the effect of bringing a clever and splendid fusion of applause and tears to the public.
