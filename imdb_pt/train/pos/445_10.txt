I saw the Enchanted April for the first time five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving their lives monotonous behind. They are very sad women at the beginning of the movie, and you can not help but cheer while planning this escape with two other women who invite to share the expenses. This is perhaps the best movie I have ever seen. It is pure and simple, without car chases, without animosities and without deaths. It was made with care and in great taste. You can not help but smile at all this - except when you're crying happy tears!
