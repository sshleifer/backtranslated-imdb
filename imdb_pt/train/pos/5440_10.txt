A trio of friends, sergeants in the British army, stir and fight over Imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they find their greatest and deadliest challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult and their demented and implacable guru. Now they must trust the humblest servant of the regiment, the GUNGA DIN water carrier, to save dozens of Queen's soldiers from a certain massacre. <br /> <br /> Based more on the Three Musketeers than on Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a dignified entry into the 1939 Golden Age of Hollywood. Filled with suspense and humor, while maintaining interludes romantic to the bare minimum, it grabs the viewer's interest and leads him to the (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., for they are really all three parts of a single organism - inseparable, and for effects. and indistinguishable purposes. However, this does not detract anything from the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note, in parentheses, that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished military career in World War I; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War II - especially in clandestine affairs and earning no less than which four honorary gentlemen after the conflict, while Grant allegedly worked undercover for British Intelligence, keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi supporters.) The real laurels of acting here should go to Sam Jaffe, the role of the title. He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity and enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem sound true. He is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is properly robust as the regimental major, while Eduardo Ciannelli is the Incarnate Evil as the guru Thuggee. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote and Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Filmmakers will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The movie chooses its villains well. The demonic cult Thuggee, worshiper of the horrid and bloody Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, was the misfortune of Indian life for six centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British military, in cooperation with several princely states, finally succeeded in suppressing the religion. From then on, it would remain a matter of novels and nightmares.
