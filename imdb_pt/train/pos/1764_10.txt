Steve Carell took his first role at 40 Year Old Virgin, having only had supporting roles in films like Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchor and his work on the Daily Show, we had only had a taste of the comedy that Carell really made of him. You may say that Will Ferrell has influenced his "comedic air," but Carell takes it to another level, all he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40 Year Old Virgin is two hours of non-stop laughter (or 4 hours if you see it twice) as I did), a perfect support cast and great leads enchant the audience throughout the film. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you'll want to see the movie again just to try to remember all of them. The song fits well into the tone of the movie, and you can tell the director what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sex jokes, nudity, and lots of language, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or any movie like that, you'll love the 40-year-old virgin.
