The genre "gangster" is now a worn out theme that is often subjected to parody. In retrospect, the series is a culmination of previous clichés that were used in its genre; fortunately, writers have advanced on this flaw, creating a realism that has been applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates its content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuances, humor and violence without embellishments. The main protagonist, Tony Soprano, is seen as a dangerous general deprived of fear and moral values ​​by his crew, however Tony is two people, which is bestial while the other is in conflict with guilt and resentment. Without any inhibitions or contradictions, I still firmly believe that The Sopranos has the best cast of recent memory. All things considered I could make an elaborate statement about the series, but I will not. If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism, look for those vital, ambiguous, relentless, epic, uncompromising definitions and the broken physiognomy of sopranos will be smiling back at you.
