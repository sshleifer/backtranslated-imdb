What is so taboo about love?! People seem to have major problems with transgenics. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie did not catch my eye. It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie that made me stop surfing on the channel. I could not believe how amazing this movie was. It touches on so many levels of human emotion that once, it has not stopped moving in some way. It is by far one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I did not see these characters as gender, just human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise to all the fearless filmmakers!
