Well done and elegant while still making sense this thriller would work best for fans not giallo to be interested in the genre than the later Argento entries that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For fans of these crazed Italian thrillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and the twists of his character and take what he is going through. The camera work is new with traces of graphic violence and strange but appropriate choices and a good soundtrack not overdone as well. The less you know about the story, the better to make it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from keeping this from being a great giallo directed by Sergio Martino is that the story does not have this extra sexual or psychological. , or both elements to put it on top. It is more of a routine mystery, the characters are well defined, but live or die according to the plot, not according to their own virtues and defects. <br /> <br /> The recent DVD release (2005) is beautiful and definitely the way to see the movie, unless they have art house exhibits that look unlikely.
