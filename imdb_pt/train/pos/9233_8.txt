Flavia (Florinda Bolkan, of the fame of "Do not torture a duckling") is locked in a convent of carnal desires by her father. Tired of all the sadism she sees around her (rape of a young woman in a pigsty, sexual desires, Flavia decides to flee the convent with her outside Jewish friend, Abraham.) They do not go very far before being captured and then brought back to being tortured and forced to repent After the punishment she joins a band of Muslims named Tarantulas who had invaded the convent before and led a crusade that turns into nothing less than a bloody battle behind the walls "Flavia the Heretic" is a well-directed and notorious piece of Italian nunsploitation. The film is somewhat creepy and sometimes despicable. a genuinely moving and clever film with a lot of nudity and blood.You can not go wrong with it.8 of 10.
