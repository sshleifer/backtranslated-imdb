A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes directed this beautiful film showing another camaraderie between father and son. The brilliant protagonist of Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a great job. Excellent performance from him again. He is a legend of acting. acting also by Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. The harvest is very good. The plot is very good.You will enjoy the movie.A great portrait of the gangster of the 1930s. Join the 1930s, this will certainly stand out as the zenith of all the gangster movies of the era. Soundtrack is very good one fit for the movie. A grand movement in totality showing what a parent does to protect his son. He fell underestimated for my liking. He retained a fully deserved 10.
