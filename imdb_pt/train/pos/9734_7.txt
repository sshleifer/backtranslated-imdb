Well, here comes another, well, romantic comedy ... but unlike all the other films of that genre, this is by far the best I've seen in a long time ... <br /> <br /> I admit, first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox, and a little because of Simon Pegg ... First of all, if you watched a fair amount of movies, you'll know that Sidney and Alison would be together in the movie and the movie, one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Okay, now this movie is made just for Simon Pegg. I do not see any other actors in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a much weaker movie if it were not for Pegg's great performance. <br /> <br /> A series of big jokes and jokes in this movie that made me laugh a lot, courtesy of Simon Pegg's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this film (I usually do not think of her as more than a common act but she was very good at it here), so there's Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox who plays the daring star of Sophie Maes ... great role for her ... <br /> <br /> Despite everything, while I generally do not agree with her ratings on IMDb, this time I completely agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go see this movie, it's really cheerful and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
