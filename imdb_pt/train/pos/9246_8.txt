One of the great mysteries of life, suffered on a daily basis, is why nice girls are so interested in idiots and heels than in cool guys. <br /> <br /> Worse, when the cool guys even want to get married. these girls, girls still prefer the idiots and heels, even after the idiots and heels have shown their contempt, have shown that they are only interested in using the girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is the cool guy, who remains cool after lying and cheating and even after losing the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is the idiot, and he's perfect on paper, plus a sad note to his fans. Jean Harlow appears as a slender Mae West, even resembling La West on some of her cynical lines. <br /> <br /> A little puzzling is that many of the other characters, They meant to be bad guys - I mean, they're locked, so they must be - they're obviously nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many nice people here, people who, in a lesse A movie or a story, would be a growl and a stab in the back, but here they go out of their way to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So, maybe the story is a little clich√©, at least by modern standards, but at the end of the day. The viewer will be glad to have watched. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors do not get credit. Once again, we can say a fervent "thank you" to the.
