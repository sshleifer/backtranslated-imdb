Another great foreign film that blocks the endless harvest of raw emanating from Hollywood! This is a life and life story. No, it's definitely not the perfect little life so often described in the totally artificial Hollywood movies, but rather the real life complete with real characters, each with strengths and weaknesses as real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these lives, interspersed on the walls of this bathroom and particularly its elderly owner, are magnificent, touching to the heart and highly thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> Sit down, relax and let yourself be carried away by simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to be learned in this film if you only open yourself to it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
