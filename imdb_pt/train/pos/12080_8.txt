Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take up a position as secretary with the rich Hughes family to overcome her boyfriend by leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and sent to family property in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they keep telling her that she is Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keeps her locked up ... but why? You'll probably guess why, but you will not mind because this is fun. <br /> <br /> Along with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask" this is one of the best B photos ever made. (B Pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no big stars). It's just the time it needs to be (only 65 minutes), it's well run, fast and exciting. He only stumbles in the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy. Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary) as the villains. Worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.
