This movie is a true and historical film. It is very useful for those who research the LDS church because it is 100% true. It's a great movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It's very factual, exciting and motivational. There are those who think that it is not factual, but rather. <br /> <br /> This is the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the prophet Joseph Smith, who restored it. He has such events in his life as the illness he had when he was a boy, his dating Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, giving birth, and so on. But more importantly, it reveals the restoration of the church.
