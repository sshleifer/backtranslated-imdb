I accidentally stumbled on this movie on TV one day. It aired mid-day on a channel not exactly famous for showing good movies. This, however, was nothing short of good. October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the launch of Sputnik to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends start building rockets. His father is not happy with his children, a new hobby and prefers to see him become a coal miner like himself or go to university with a football scholarship as his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. A little predictable, maybe, but okay, because it does not focus much on those parts of the story. It is important part, but where this is obvious the internal action, the action between the characters is focused. The story is good. There are a few clich√©s, but that's fine. It's based on real events, so you can not just give up those cliches. The characters are very good. Where the story is in decline, the characters are shown and manage to keep the action and quality of the film high. You know these characters and you feel sympathy for them. They are well written and believable. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie. The scenarios and style of the 50's are complete and the images are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the movie very good. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal offers great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are also good. All together this makes a very strong cast. <br /> <br /> After all, I'm happy to have watched this movie. It was first after seeing that I learned it was based on actual events. If I knew that when I saw him, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting film. It's a movie that I think everyone might enjoy. It's kind of a movie to feel good about. Not bad at all!
