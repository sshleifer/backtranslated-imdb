THE MORTAR MAN ... a tragic victim of the space race, he perished MELT ... never understanding that the race was gone ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand off the kitchen stove. But instead of screaming something that a NORMAL person screams, he shouts something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie you came across ... is not a normal movie. You just took the first step in THE AMAZING MISTAKE OF MAN, the famous movie of the late '70s with the wonderful makeup effects of Rick Baker. Baker was about to become a superstar, and did so at the same time as his famous "canteen aliens" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name, and the AMAZING FUSION MAN did not become. <br /> <br /> It may have something to do with the fact that this movie is simply creepy. From the opening credits ("Starring Alex Rebar as THE AMAZING MALE MAN" ... that's what he really says!), To the chubby nurse running through the glass door, to the fisherman's head passing by a waterfall and breaking graphically in some rocks, this film offers many, many moments of pure incomprehensibility. "Why do they ... but how does he ... why are they ...?" After a while, you give up wondering why and see it as what it is - a piece of junk really fun. An astronaut returns to Earth in a molten radioactive condition; he escapes and, his mind disintegrating as his body, begins a mad melting slaughter. Authorities quickly decide that the man who melts must be stopped, but (probably not wanting to "cause panic") he wants to be captured as quietly as possible. So they send a guy with a geiger counter behind him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Storywise, surprisingly little happens during the movie. The melted guy wanders killing people. A doctor searches for him with a geiger counter. Several characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. Eventually, the doctor reaches the man who melts, but is shot by a security guard for no reason, after which he explains that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson". The melting man wanders and finally dissolves into a large puddle of goo. The End. <br /> <br /> It's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun, despite a rather pessimistic ending. Supposedly, a widescreen DVD release is planned. A very special movie.
