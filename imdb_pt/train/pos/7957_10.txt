Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I've been looking everywhere to find these two movies and I can not find them anywhere in my area. (I am Australian). Could you please help me and tell me where I can buy it. At General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie wen I was 5 years old and still is even now when I am a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie, except for my younger sister because I've watched her many times that she's sick of it. I love this movie and I can not wait until I can buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
