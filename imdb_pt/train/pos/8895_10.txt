I accidentally felt in this movie on TV, and I could not let it ... It's really a great movie that makes people learn about American history with the Vietnam War, the time of flower power, the fight of racism ... It illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, of race that happened in the 60's ... I was born in 1980, so I did not know all this before ... In France, US history is not a priority and this movie really taught me many facts! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie more than once every day !! It's really great ... what a shame it only appeared on TV not in theaters ... <br /> <br />
