Before watching this movie I had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the movie, but listening was not doing it for me, so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds form an interesting group of individuals who are determined to descend the Cahulawassee River and the unfortunate series of events that permeate all of them. Character development takes some time to engage the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you meet these guys as if they were your friends. The acting, the dialogue is very very real, as close to reality as possible for Hollywood acting. Reynolds character "Lewis" was interesting as a guy who comes out very difficult but underneath the manly veneer finds himself a very smooth and broken man (I was impressed by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character who is in the spotlight most , the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him in every corner really shape and transform him into a different man in the end (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like the dumb idiots they like to play with and they do not seem to be serious enough unless they do, too, and they really were surprised with Director Boorman's view of Dickey's novel, impressed. You can not spend your whole life without watching this movie. I give eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
