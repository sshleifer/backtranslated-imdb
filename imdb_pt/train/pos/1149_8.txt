Quick and funny satire on that original reality TV, the novel. The playwright Robert Harling's script is packed with a ridiculous liners and situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into poor improvisation and a brain transplant. Keven Kline's murder of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious. "Her brain will scan laterally into the next houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It's a pleasure to see a click on the cast as in this movie. This is a classic that somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> Q. Alan Silvestri's score is an added bonus. It fits into the novel with its flamboyant and melodramatic air.
