I can understand why some people like this movie and why some people do not like it. For me though, I really like it, even if I have noticed some good bits, not so impressive pieces. The animation was really great, just like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi (I was physically sick when I read what happened to her) Also, Carface is a very convincing villain, especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback. (I particularly loved "Morons, I'm surrounded by idiots") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all the villains of Don Bluth. Charlie and Itchy just did not have the same brilliance, but I loved King Gator and his music. Part of the movie is very haunting, like Annabelle's "You can never go back", which still frightens me. Unfortunately, there were some bits that I did not like very much. The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that little kids found disturbing, but the ending is very poignant. However, the major flaw was the rather subdued songs and the way they were sung. None of them in particular stands out, with the exception of "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives," and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise has done a much better song. In short, an assistive film, it could have been more, but it is definitely memorable, and I definitely watch it again. 7/10 Bethany Cox
