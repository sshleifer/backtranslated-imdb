TACHIGUI: THE AMAZING LIVES OF RAPID FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese Title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Introducing: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera - - ------------------------------------ <br /> <br /> Way back in 1995 Mamoru Oshii launched his dazzling animated feature Ghost In The Shell, which helped consolidate the international acceptance of anime - and also focused on the overall concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix. The sequel to the film, Innocence (2004), was the first Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and left the heads spinning for both their innovative style and effects its unfathomable plot. <br /> <br /> Always the trend-setter, Oshii has now introduced us to Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of Fast Food Grifters? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell nor with Japanese anime. <br /> <br /> Say hello to Oshii's creation of "superlivemation": not exactly animation, nor exactly live-action. Instead, the cast remained somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a seemingly simple form, reminiscent of Balinese puppets. The movement itself is a pompous and stop motion style that echoes sequences from the experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988) by Shinya Tsukamoto. <br /> <br /> "I could not think of any method other than this," Oshii said. in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice of the cast is equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a hamburger fanatic, while renowned Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends his time on the screen being murdered bizarrely. Others include Katsuya Terada, who became interested in Oshii in Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects specialist who worked on Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like a dry NHK documentary. ??? which belies the comic tone here, as well as Yamadera's long career expressing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a bizarre re-imagining of post-WWII Japan in the context of several fast-food outlets - from ramen soba to gyudon footbands; American dogs in the convenience trays of convenience stores to the chain restaurants of burgers inspired by McDonalds. "Food is a primordial root of desire," Oshii said as an explanation. <br /> <br /> Launched in the mix is ​​a new breed of consumer: the title's fast-food grifters, people who do not like to pay for their tucker and are constantly adjusting their elaborate scams to mark free munchies. <br /> <br /> Oshii said his hidden motive was a tribute to the "art" of eating food on the streets? something still considered somewhat taboo in this country, and that somehow explains the use of "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> The live-action film director (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Oshii often confused the definition between the two media. The celluloid result is deposited somewhere in the gray area between the two formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experiment here is as stimulating as it is irritating. Just do not ask what all this really means; Oshii's films, which are equal parts and innovative, are often not particularly clear in terms of history. Where does Oshii get is through a liberal dose of black humor? here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death by hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger chef? and in the very nature of the surrealism film. <br /> <br /> This is a man who loves the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps owes both Andrei Tarkovsky and David Lynch. So it is not surprising that, at any given moment, a B-52 bomber will fly a Yoshinoya type franchise. The 54-year-old director-director seemed to find it natural. "The Japan I described in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
