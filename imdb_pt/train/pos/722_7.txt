One of the greatest cult classics for movie producer B and C, Roger Corman, was the Ramones vehicle (originally called Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. It's just a simple, technically dated story (but it would serve extra doses of nostalgic humor, considering that these were the kinds of things that made Napoleon Dynamite's characters funny - see the Eaglebauer van) about teenagers who love rock n 'roll. <br /> <br /> Vince Lombardi High School students meet the resistance of the evil director, Miss Evelyn Togar (played by Mary Woronov, favorite of classical cults), who fears that Rock N 'Roll will turn children into uncontrollable quarrels and loving. a free zone of Rock N 'Roll. In fact, she plans to end Rock N 'Roll for all students regardless of whether they are in school, and she has the cooperation of most adults who can make the plan successful. <br /> <br /> But if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help. Ramones fanatics, she wrote some songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to give the Ramones, and in trying to do it, is rejected by Miss. Togar who does everything she can to stop her from going see the Ramones playing in the city. It culminates in a final revolt among adults who hate obsolete fun and teens (in an ending that is reminiscent of Over the Edge, a bit). After the punk years, when the garage rockers' fame, The Ramones (and others) marked another change in the evolution of the music, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of everything in such a humorous and exaggerated way. <br /> <br /> It's mostly a lightweight comedy but a great wellness comedy, however, when you're in the mood for something more laid-back to entertain you. With Jerry Zucker (famous for Airplanes) and Joe Dante (of Gremlins fame) both taking part in some of the recordings, you may get the idea of ​​what kind of mood you are in (and not to mention, expect to see Dick Miller, if only for a few minutes at the end of the movie). The story must have inspired later (and was consequently updated) by the mid-90s comedy, Detroit Rock City, which some minor shifts in the vehicle for the aging glamor rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend passing the vehicle Corey Feldman, the Rock N 'Roll High School Forever, released almost a decade later. The original is still the best.
