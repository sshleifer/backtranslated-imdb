Every child experiences the growth of trauma and each child's active imagination gets the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco from the upcoming Clint Eastwood film CHANGELING - which resembles Henry Thomas in 1982), the combination can be deadly . <br /> <br /> A six-year-old solitary whose imagination comes at high speed when he is discouraged to learn his parents quarreling with Peter (Sean Bridgers, deceased from "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS: Miami ") suddenly decide to divorce by leaving it on their own devices and release a new tenant? a zombie in your closet. <br /> <br /> Jake actually leaves this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon (Matthew Josten) who gives him a hard copy on the internet of the re: zombies FAQ. Is Jake so convinced that anyone is trying to get him? and your family ?? he begins to shock a plan of action to protect them before it is too late. <br /> <br /> The indie rookie Shelli Ryan ?? Who wrote and directed ?? but he (smartly) overcomes the latter, with a decent story driven by good acting (De Marco is the rare breed of child actor, where he is a CHILD and not "acting" - all her nuances are very evident from the awkward, shy and introverted child that many can relate to as well (I certainly can) Bridgers makes her husband an empathetic crook in the realization that he really loves his son while Bloom has the hardest job of building sympathy like Drew Ruth's mother (Monette Magrath, who resembles Laura Dern) is constantly nurturing her implicit information by driving a wedge between Jake and her father.Magrath also has one difficult task to make her character manipulator is relatively pleasant, but she proves in a revealing scene that I will not enter r in detail, but it shows why she is the way she is (and more importantly, how she also affected her own child). <br /> <br /> The subjective camera of the fillmmaker is also well employed (many angles shown form Jake's point of view at waist level or a little inclined; that is, the upside-down picture of Peter carrying his son on same position while having fun in the yard), and the edition is relatively perfect. Ryan based the script on growing personal experiences and also witnessing firsthand a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful in inflicting their fears, anger and stress on their children. Here, the film is very successful in conveying its theme. <br /> <br /> However, the fundamentals of horror are a little disjointed to say the least, but the homage to George A. Romero's zombie movies is shown with love for Ryan (Jake's mother is sleeping in the front of TV as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD leaves the pool, causing his own belief that the undead are at home. The metaphor of a monster acting as a substitute for domestic abuse can be a bit heavy, but again, the fear of child of one thing under the bed is universal.
