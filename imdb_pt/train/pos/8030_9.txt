This was another great movie by Tom Berenger .. But some people are right, it was like another character from SGT BARNES, but it was still fantastic .. Tom Berenger played a great marksman in the jungles of Panama! Billy Zane, at first, was a bit annoying as Cpl Upham's Rescue Ryan Soldier, but in the end he got a little more aggressive! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it .. I remember it would not have as much action as a reg action movie .. I have this on DVD too and it's great!
