An excellent series, masterfully acted and directed but not loved (I was told) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn by him after a single performance. Now it is only visible in private collections and, through the British Film Institute, on special request. Very unfortunate, as Ian Holm's nuanced portrait of the tired and determined Bernard Samson is superb; one of his best performances. The supporting cast, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are excellent. With Mel Martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife, and Michael Degen as the mercurial Werner, the story positively boils with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game.
