I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strangest thing is that I've never watched it since. The other day I was babysitting and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven, so we rented the two movies and watched them together today and he really loved those movies. So many memories have seen this movie one more time and I have to admit that I even cried a little. I'm 22 years old and the end still comes to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most moving animated films and I'm shocked by this rating of 5.8, I thought this movie would bring good memories to others as well. I'll admit the animation was a bit typical, but the story is so charming and fun. Charlie is a game dog that is killed by another game dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a watch that can not stop working or that is the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spy on him, they discover how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan girl who talks to the animals and finds out who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he eventually learns that perhaps he should put Ann-Marie first before himself when Carface comes back at him with vengeance. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect family movie, not Disney, but this is a great family movie to watch. Not to mention it's so cute and touching. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They are so loving and I think I'm going to cry again. But anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
