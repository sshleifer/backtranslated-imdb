This is the kind of image that John Lassiter would be doing today if it were not for the CGI advances. And that's just to say that he would also be forgotten if technology had not made things sexy and cool since 1983. _Second ... _ has the same intelligence, imagination and sense of real excitement you would find in a Pixar movie , executed only under the constraints of the medium c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent vocalization to produce a film that attracts many levels. It should be spoken at the same time with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
