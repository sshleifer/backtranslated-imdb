That's what the musical genre was made of. Humor, talent, romance and action, all together. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing more needs to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. The women in the movie were fine, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> It is a true classic that can be enjoyed at any age. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to be seen and enjoyed!
