The movie as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with successful shifts of Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly examined and the approval of the script, as well as all aspects of the film, even clothing, was closely watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover did not have something to be proud of. His administration of the bureau from 1924 to his death was created in the best research services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already begun collecting dossiers about powerful people to secure and protect his small kingdom. And he was determined to make sure no movie showed even a single wart on the department. The films show only continued successes and criticisms about the failures that have occurred, and the part of the department in the witch hunt of the early 50's. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firm on the cheek.
