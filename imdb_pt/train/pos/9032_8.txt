Maybe it's not the most original way of telling a story, we've seen it all before in many movies .. but .. I liked October Sky anyway. There's something, great direction and good acting from everywhere, especially Laura Dern (the teacher) and Chris Cooper (the father). I want to be a rocket engineer! :)
