HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror films of the last decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I've seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves yet again that he can handle any role that comes his way. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, right now, Kevin Bacon shocked us * with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror movies ever. The action is intense and the chills are real. You may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching in the dark on a stormy night. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Joe Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. Everyone does an outstanding job. <br /> <br /> --- Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After testing on animals, they pass tests on humans. But someone has to be the subject. Volanteering, Caine is invisible. But when his team is unable to bring back visibility, Caine is crazed by his condition when he seeks his revenge ... * final spoilers * The film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic until the next century. Becoming the basis for a joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most fans of action and horror. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks to a mad invisible man. And then change the water to fire and explosions. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting ... The man is 5/5.
