I saw this in a Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the subcharacters were very rude. That got out of the movie, just like the musical score, which bothered me throughout the movie. If the score was improved, I could ignore the few overdone scenes. So the movie would be much, much better.
