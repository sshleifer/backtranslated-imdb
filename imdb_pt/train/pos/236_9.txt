It's a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "The Amati Girls" is one of those films. In the old cinemas, I would have stayed for more presentations. Was this story autobiographical for the writer / director? It has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> The cast of all stars presents their characters with credibility and tenderness. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl to be a big sister? I have loved your work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most films, one suspends the belief because we know it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult to suspend this belief in "The Amati Girls". Sit down a part of this family! How I wanted to come to Dolores's defense when her family was suffocating her emotional life. And she wanted to cheer up Lee Grant while she criticized the color of Cloris Leachman's hair. Humor everywhere is not belly laughter humor, but instead has a quality of feeling good that satisfies much more than falls and such. <br /> <br /> The love that is portrayed in this movie family is to be imitated and esteemed. <br /> <br /> It is not by chance that the family name, Amati, translated from Italian means "loved ones."
