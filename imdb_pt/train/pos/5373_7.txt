It may not be the biggest absolute entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the award for the most inventively titled episode! "The house that bled to death"? I could scream this title all day long without getting tired of it! And in addition to the wonderful title, this short also benefits from a solidly written script and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments. It may require extra insight before you completely understand the quirky quirk twist, but it's definitely an original idea for a horror short. The story begins with pictures of an elderly couple sipping tea at their middle-class home. The husband sadistically kills his wife and, several years later, the "cursed" house is still on sale. A young couple and their cherub daughter move and begin to restore it, but mysterious events occur and especially affect the young Sophie. Your beloved cat is dead and even your birthday party is ruined when one of the pipes in the house suddenly sneezes blood for all the guests (a particularly scary sequence, this!). Is the old house really haunted? Or maybe the seemingly helpful neighbors cause all the horror? The answers to these questions are provided at the original and reasonably unpredictable climax, and there is room for a real shock at the end. The tension is masterfully built and the owner's home is filled with mysterious landscapes, like the pair of rusty machetes used by her husband to kill his wife. Little warning though, the sequence with the cat is difficult to watch when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner of the short TV series of the Hammer!
