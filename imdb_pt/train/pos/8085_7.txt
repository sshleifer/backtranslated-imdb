One thing I can say about this movie is very long, LONG TIME! I recently bought this movie a few months ago, seeing that there was a new version coming out. I was happy to find out it was made in 1978 because the 70's (although I've never lived in them) is really one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I watched this movie, the story was actually pretty good at first, but after about 50 minutes it started to get very annoying and repetitive. I'll admit the animation impressed me! It was nothing I'd ever seen before and it was pretty cool to see. but the film could honestly have been a bit better, could have a lot more talk and story than just 15 to 20 minutes of scenes that just had weird fights. so in the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie got it and it looked good again, but it ended unexpectedly. in my opinion I thought it was extremely long. I know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that's still long for a cartoon, but since it was annoying for most of the movie, it did seem like it was 4 hours long !!!! but overall it's a good movie I think and I'll watch it again on one of those "nothing to do days". I'll see the new one and I hope it's better!
