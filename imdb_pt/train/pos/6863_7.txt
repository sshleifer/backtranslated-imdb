A great thriller with excellent slow-motion work, adding to the drama, makes it a pleasure to watch and enjoy. Director and writer Brian de Palma makes a super imitation of Hitchcock (many call it a "ripoff") with this film and the 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the work of the camera (and several scenes with people hidden in every negative side of the movie, at least for anyone who has some sort of moral standard, is the general scorn of all the characters, including the cop played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). The opening scene is still shocking with a long bath scene by Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it, such as Dickinson (if she really does is about the closes) and Nancy Allen is not ashamed to show their bodies. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz comes on the scene after the murder. fascinating and although It is obvious who the murderer is, it is still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way, especially for males looking at naked women.
