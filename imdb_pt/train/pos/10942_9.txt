I would give this show a ten in ten if it were not for the fart jokes. You are so sensitive that it is futile! So quick to point out the show's "racism" and the jokes, but they're also so quick to say a ridiculously sexist crap like "well, duh, some of these other programs make those jokes a lot better because at least they have hot women." So disgusting. Are the jokes about abortion great because, in fact, who takes the abortion seriously? At least I'm not a * boring * son. I heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are teaming up to make a movie about the sisters taking a trip together. Talk about a movie of the year!
