I am a fan of both actors / singers, especially Gackt and when I discovered this movie and watch the trailer, I think this is a silly thing. After a long wait, I finally watched and here is my comment .. I I consider that everyone knows the plot and will not talk about it, instead, my first applause goes to the acting, generally that the Japanese movies are not bright and act. However, MoonChild is the entire cast. is simply wonderful and came into it, especially Gackt reflects the emotions of his characters and changes very well, I like many of his dramatic and humorous scenes, as for HYDE part, his acting is good, but he deliberately stays in the background as actor, respectively, as his character does, throughout the film. I did not like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors, but due to the small budget, it still has brilliant moments but the real gem of the movie is the story. It has some cheesy moments, but it's okay for me, and the friendship theme of the film is really well developed and touching at times, otherwise the story points to a cruel world that no one guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes reflects this theme for the visual. Interesting note aside, this movie bears some resemblance to the excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire, which is also played by the most beautiful (not cute, beautiful) American movie actors, actually Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew, still unique in its own.Only problem that MoonChild is that is a sometimes, I am a fan of Japanese cinema and I used to but it is not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters.But all in all, this film is very good and very emotional at times as for the actors / singers duo I hope to see your other films in the future, and I recommend this to everyone who likes science fiction-vampire-fiction and novel films 8/10
