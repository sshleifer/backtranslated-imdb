The Castle of Man is a wonderful example of a pre-code film. It involves realistic events with truly pleasant and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored with what's around him. One night, he meets Trina, a beauty of any standard that is cold and alone. She refused to resort to prostitution, so she did not eat for several days, but the two get along very well and form a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave her, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between the two, even if they live in a shack near the river. <br /> Tracy is one of the great actors. of the silver screen. His characters are incredible and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face, making it easy to identify, even if we believe he is behaving badly. Young is great at pre-encoded movies. Her character is very sweet but far from perfect, making her even more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The pre-coding elements include skinny dipping, pre-wedding pregnancy and crime.
