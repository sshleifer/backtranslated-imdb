Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, produces and collaborates in this last production. Not only can he make an interesting movie about the cheap. But he reaches a new level when Herr Lommel works on footage of almost his entire film catalog. I've seen movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a special guest addition to the tomb courtesy of this movie). Even though it uses many old images, it works fine (and very creatively I add). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. he also corresponds to a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him try to find this aspirant to the zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer put two and two together and recover some of his former glory? Is David Hess still the man? You will have to find out for yourself and watch the killer of the zodiac. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about the original zodiac killer. I've also heard people complain about this movie being filmed on video. And. The director's old school art style outweighs the fact that it's filmed on video. My only complaint was the overuse of images from previous films by Herr Lommel (but I understand why "wink" "wink".) Do not believe the hype. This is a gritty and street horror movie. Like the warning in the initial states, this movie does not glorify murder. You have to like this statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend to fans of Ulli Lommel.
