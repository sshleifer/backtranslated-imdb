Men can enslave Lollo, if they like (or their lollos - she gave her name to a slang for breasts in French), but the ladies have a bit even more flavorful in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only handsome but can act . Do not be discouraged if your version does not have subtitles, because in this simple and bold story of love and war, in which everything is fair, they are not necessary. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the movie, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and says he's going to marry the king's daughter. After that, the story is quite clear from gallic gestures and running, jumping and fencing. On the downside, the truism of the story and the intricacy of tone become rather tiresome, and it is annoying that the French seem to consider themselves far superior to Hollywood to bother even with the plausibility of their Exciting acrobatics. And of course the non-Francophile loses a little of ooh-la-la, like: Virtuous Girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seductive: My dear, what made you think I was interested in this trifle?
