It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be. is greatly underestimated. people have forgotten what movies are, nowadays they only think of boom boom movies, which can be quite entertaining watching with popcorn and friends, like transformers, movies that are oriented, with hyper-high budget as 300mln or higher, in special effects only and which are stupid movies without plot. It's the kind of movie I like the most. Of course it's fun to watch great CGIs, but we do not get anything essential with that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I honestly think the performance was excellent. Especially busy Philipps, alongside Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (which I respect) made this movie an Oscar worth. Busy Philipps' emotional performance was astonishing, it's a shame not to see Oscar in her hands, which she deserves.
