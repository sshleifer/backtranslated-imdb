Pierce Brosnan the youngest, but no longer James Bond, is a killer. He's very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story begins, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. So one night, they're having drinks in a bar and they start talking. Then, suddenly, you find these two people being drawn together during a series of events. The story is great, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious. I never thought Pierce Brosnan was so funny, but he really is and I must say that this movie is mandatory.
