First of all, I must say that I made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence. I say, unfortunately, because after seeing the first 2 election, the election seems a bit disappointing. Both films are gangster epics that are similar in shape. And while the election is a nice piece of film ... it's not as good as its sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first installment of the election, the two competitors for the president are shown; Big D and Lok. After some scenes of discussion between the "uncles" about who should have the title of president, they (almost unanimously) decide that Lok (Simon Yam) will lead the triads. Suffice it to say that this does not far exceed Big D competitor (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and, in an attempt to influence the acquisition, Big D kidnaps two of the uncles to convince the election committee at his side. This has disastrous results and takes the triads to total war. Lok is determined to become president, but will not become official until he can reclaim the "Dragon Head Baton," a material representation of the president's power. The current president, Whistle (Chung Wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race continues to see who can get it back first. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the recovery of Baton. . As the two aspiring leaders look for him, they must dodge cops and opposing sides, leading to one of the prominent scenes in the election, which involves a subaltern named Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete and many bad guys. The presence of Nick Cheung catches the eye, to say the least ... I wonder if this influenced director Johhnie To somehow by making the second Election, as he delivers more of Jet's character in the sequel. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives a scene stealing performance, I must not give up due to the rest of the actors in the film. Election has a great cast with well thought out performances that are subtle and shocking. Simon Yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from Hong Kong heavy actors such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the underrated Suet Lam. There are really no weak links in acting and one can easily believe that they're watching real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things about the Election is Johnnie To's eye. to the camera. There are some really awesome scenes in the movie and it goes without saying that you definitely know how to frame your shots, as the viewer is treated with a host of innovative and very bright camera angles and positions. All this makes the election, above all, a great movie. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film come mainly from the amount of characters involved in the election. It's a bit difficult to follow because the movie is so full of characters that are not part of the plot. While the sequel chooses to focus more on the two candidates, the first Election offers the entire electoral process with several Uncles, subordinates, and cops filling the plot. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it had been a little longer with more time devoted to the inner workings of the Triad, or if director Johnnie To had channeled the necessary elements and exposed more about them. <br /> <br /> In short - All in all, this is a wonderfully brutal movie with a great cast, excellent direction and slow pacing that packs a punch. It's a little more complicated than it needed to be.
