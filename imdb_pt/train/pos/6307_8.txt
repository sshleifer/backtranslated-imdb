I had never heard of this movie despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company he produced and he appears in a very funny piece of support) and his director of Ocean's 11, Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we chose this in a discount box for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars for that!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But then I am of the opinion that if William H. Macy is in it, you can not be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of Ealing's comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, with more swearing. This is a weird and sometimes ripping fun movie. The actual robbery made me laugh so hard that I was crying. Maybe the funniest use of underwear in movie history. Maybe it was the low expectations I had, but I watched with a group of people and we had a blast. Best $ 5 I have spent ages.
