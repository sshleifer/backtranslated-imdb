For those who wish to have an impression of the Soviet vision of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the sepia-yellowish colors of old photographs that improve black and white during the middle of the century and in color as history approaches modern times (ie in the 1960s). /> <br /> The story centers on a boy in a remote village in Siberia, which is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the Tsarist era. He later joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet communism to his village. Her son, for the local beauty, fights against the Germans during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated with some Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow, but absolutely logical and very well done. It can be seen in three parts.
