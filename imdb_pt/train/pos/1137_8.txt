It's very very funny. You know, just like a comedy should be. Also looks pretty good, as a Hollywood show should. So, what more do you want? Howz about a very good Sally Fields. She's so much better here than anything I've ever seen, and she looks so good. This movie is all you need to understand why she's a star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are very good. I used to pretend to be a bad TV actor with my girlfriend. We would do that thing where you look really fast from one eye to the other from your partner. They do not do it on Soap Dish. Great. The eyes have! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many amazing performances, it's fun to wait for each one to reappear. There is an entire workshop going on with Kevin Kline about how Overact very very subtly. Got that? Yes, he is very good. So is Robert Downey, Jr., who has since made his career playing Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, although not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and fascinating, especially when she's angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, its natural timing giving here a little flat delivery a little Zing. Okay, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear you. <br /> <br /> And then, there's Hair. Soap dish was made in the late 80's BIG Hair, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in itself. They get bigger and dumber, just like yours. Yes, we have photos. <br /> <br /> The soap dish is better than I thought, it would be best if I wanted to. I'm tired of movies that tell me that I should care for superficial egomaniacs, egocentric and semi-talented, ie. TV Actors Soap. Soap Dish looks happy just to make me laugh at them. Thank you.
