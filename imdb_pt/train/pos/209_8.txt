Walter Matthau and George Burns work so well together. Willy's acidity with the pre-amnesiac Al is a mixture made in the sky. The scene in which they meet in Willy's apartment is a jewel and the final scene completes the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatic along with his general misunderstanding of what is happening form a great characterization. The time of George Burns is legendary and nowhere has been better than in this movie, its calm calmness with dry responses in the desert is memorable. Watch the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask about the Spanish janitor and Al's reaction - priceless.
