That was incredible, which meant it was hard to believe, that the "forgotten tribe" would make this impressive migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not stage scenes and scenes. But what shots they are! Cinematography, under extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the Iranian music score added to the video release gives this memorable documentary additional wealth. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this and Kon Tiki the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how resilient, resilient and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or by the necessity of adventure or in the name of science.
