I really like this movie. I can watch this regularly and not get bored of it. I suppose this is one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It has 6 characters; each one has a unique style of kung fu that is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dying master sends the sixth poison, his last student, to try to mend the mistakes he suspects some of his students made. <br /> <br /> How will the last student find the other poisons? How will he know which one is bad? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We also see the poisons fighting each other in all combinations. It's fun to see how their styles match against each other. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. There is nothing better than that.
