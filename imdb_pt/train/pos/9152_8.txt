This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the end has occluded this most acclaimed film. <br /> <br /> It's filmed in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel for the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon because of this film technique. <br /> <br /> The macabre characters are very well represented and presented especially 'called Joe. However, the healthy (normal) characters are a bit pathetic too for my taste - granted, they must look pathetic, but this is done a bit OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly (and the naive camera work looks like the movie 'B' to start) and very normally, but you soon realize the imminent brutality that is about to occur. This is one of the most "twisted" movies of cold-hearted violence. <br /> <br /> After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy end, I was disappointed. I would have given the movie a 9 if the ending was in line with the rest of the movie, but how is it that he earns only a 7 with the strength of the 'eeriness' scenes and biting his nails earlier in the movie. /> <br /> Give him a watch and sorry the end!
