As a comic book reader, who still sees me as a total kid in the heart, I admit I might have been a bit biased about this movie. I mean, there has not been a good superhero movie for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was not a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent movie trips (read Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men was definitely not a high voltage effect. Full action movie, it was a comedy. And based on that, it was a success. There was everyone in the little theater laughing, and was applauded and laughed until the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds the right touch of madness. William H. Macy plays a great straight man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, who use fart, are added just to keep the boys happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes look like copies of Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still just plain funny. There are some lines that will catch up to the most tired spectator by surprise, and bring tears of belly-laughter between us. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. While not an all-time classic, it's twice as funnier than the latest Austin Powers reform. The writing is good and the cast is great. If you're worried, plan the matinee and pay less, but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us does not support the losers from time to time?
