You know the story - a group of brave no-hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance to win - is a story that was made to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the best etc). Now does Korea dispense a Taekwondo team fighting for glory? and guess what ?? the result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie does not fall on your face is the talented youngster who really makes you care about the characters, and this in turn keeps you watching until the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not produce the usual agitation of movements and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu movies; the action is limited to (though impressive) kicking and an occasional punch. It does not matter, because it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle to make something of themselves, which makes this film a success.
