By no means a masterpiece, and far from the best of Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has much to offer. The locations and the beautiful technicolor cinematography bring us back to a long time since the past. Errol Flynn shows moments of his past glory, and is just like Jim Brennan, a pilot who has returned to haunt him. The image is actually a remake of "Singapore" from 1947, and the story seems very artificial and clich√© "by today's standards." Many of the support cast also seem to be simply "going through the motions" in this picture. also compared it to one of the great names of the time, CASABLANCA.While watching the film, I could see many of the similarities, but, hey, Casablanca inspired countless imitators, so take it for what it's worth. is a fan of Flynn or old love stories, maybe want to take a look at this movie. Otherwise, I recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of the Hollywood classics ....
