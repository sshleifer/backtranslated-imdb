This was one of the highlights of the second season of ST: the semi-forgettable of TNG, before they 'grew up' or grew alone in the third season and beyond. This was not only a showcase for beginners like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but it was also the continuation of Data's quest for his "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> On a side note, I'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress whose character Okona was about to meet (after Teri Hatcher's character) before being rudely interrupted by the lieutenant Worf. I remember watching this 'first-run' episode in my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would have been a perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this pretty girl is actually ...
