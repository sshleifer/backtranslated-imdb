A charming and funny movie that gets a solid note on all sides. I saw a screener of this movie recently at work. It was great to see this movie in contrast to all the bad horror movies I see every day. So much so that I thought of writing. I'm not sure if this movie goes to theaters, but I hope so. It's a good movie to see with friends, it's a charmer, and it has some funny jokes. The acting was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf.) The direction was very good (not a movie that needed to be super directed). the characters are smart and have a good rhythm. As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice these things (I'm an idiot) Anyway, a very cute movie that I recommend.
