My kids just stopped in that movie the other night, and when things started showing up, it really piqued my interest. I had to go to the bowling alley so I had to tape it to me on the dvr so I could watch the rest later. Well, I just watched and the front of my shirt must be soaked after weeping buckets. It was a great movie, although I could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing. And I would never, in a million years, have guessed the reason why Alissia went from a beautiful girl to an antisocial goth. That was probably why my shirt was soaked because I felt the same pain Alissia was feeling. I also would not have looked for this movie, but I'm sure I saw it. Very touching, very touching. Great for anyone who likes a good drama or tear-jerker.
