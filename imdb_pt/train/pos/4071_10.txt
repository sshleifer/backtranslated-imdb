I saw this movie for the first time when it was about seven years old and I was completely charmed by it, but for years I could not figure out how the movie was called. now I'm 21 and I came across the movie by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the film was a bit foggy, I was not disappointed by what I saw. the animation of this film is superb evoking a whole world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn to the film just for that. But this movie also has a plot that will delight and entertain adults and children. with a floating island, a crazy general, a nice pirate grandma and a well-built love story, this movie will not disappoint you. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
