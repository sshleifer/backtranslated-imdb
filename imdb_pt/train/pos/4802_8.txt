I just saw this episode tonight, in a presentation recently added by one of our local independent channels, which now features two episodes every day of the week. <br /> <br /> As the gentleman opined in the other, previous review here, I agree that this may not have been one of the best shows in the series, but I find it amusing anyway. My father was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown, Cincinnati), for whom the young Rod Serling had worked in the media there - and I remember Dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there. Overall, "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the true classics of television, and given its production during the heyday of the Cold War, provides not only a view of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic image of production . techniques, creative views and the actors of this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> "spoiler" smaller. * This particular story describes, as well as other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story in which the place is intended to provide a "surprise" end. Sometimes the characters are on Earth, from elsewhere, while the story at first implies that at least one is a "Terran". These generally contained the message (as here) of a situation instigated by the doomsday buttons that were finally pressed by the superpowers during this period of the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Seen today, stories like this provide a nostalgic look. in this worldly point of view there are 4-5 decades ago, and still provides some food to think about. - how did this episode. <br /> <br /> While the dialogue may not have extended the handsome talents of the leaders, it still presents a simple and important message, and deserving 20 minutes of entertainment and interest.
