Seriously I loved this movie .. I had started to read the book and I loved it ... the way everything was created and everything had a purpose ... I think this movie did so well was because Louis Sachar wrote the script. and of course Andrew Davis directed ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first film ... the plot is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book .. I guess that this movie is not at all boring ... I just loved it ... and I encourage anyone to read the book..all throughout this film are very well put together and carefully crafted ... two thumbs up for me in all the senses
