In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas" at a local competition and is admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there, the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie It was full of great chants and performances and characters that kept the pace at a very good pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were excellent as well as Nick Roth's camera work was actually done well and I was very pleased with the ending (it looks like a sequel could be in the making). Congratulations to the director and to all the others who participated in this production. A jewel in the movie archives.
