"The Man In The Moon" is a very good movie. It is very touching at times and is very well done in all aspects. I would not say the movie was terribly original, but what is it nowadays? <br /> <br /> The cast members did a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age, and does a good job. Jason London does a good job too. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seems to be the kind of father you dread, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you like to play movies about growing up and dealing with what life does for you then you should watch this movie. I suggest reading the synopsis of the plot and if that sounds like something you would be interested in, then go ahead. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br/> <br/> -Chris
