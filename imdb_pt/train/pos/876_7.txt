A super-unusual Audiard movie, Read My Lips is a pulpy and lonely thriller. It is perfect for the gracious charisma of Vincent Cassel and features a wonderfully contained performance of Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard, just as KArin Viard appears to Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she is referred to by all as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. <br /> <This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, an office maid, brought on by colleagues exploiting her deafness. However, she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like Cassel's ex-convict, Paul. Each one explores the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to fight through their respective situations and form an unconventional romantic rapprochement. Devos / Audiard manages the deafness of Carla and her attentive twisted world with a discreet and stylish style. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001), Audiard is already clearly in control of its manipulation of tension, action and investment in its frame. with a truly visceral experience that will become the great success - A Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
