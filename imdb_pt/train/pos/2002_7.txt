To some extent, I really liked this movie better than the original VAMPIROS. I found the film quite misogynistic. As a woman and a fan of terror, I am accustomed to the fact that women in danger are a milestone. But they just slap Sheryl Lee too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a more complete character, and the main villain is a girl! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vampire in BLADE) is very supernatural and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... ok, yes, no great actor, but he's fine. At least he does not start singing. Take the cable if you can. You're in Encore Action this month.
