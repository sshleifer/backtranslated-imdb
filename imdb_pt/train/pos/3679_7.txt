I just watched the movie two days ago, and I was full of anticipation, with Paris being my second favorite city in Europe and I spent an 18-month romantic there in the 80's. I was a little disappointed that Most of this group of vignettes, though original and artistically made, did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Not enough of the novel! We did not see any of the tree-lined boulevards ... There was a lot of darkness, not just literal, but figuratively. Some of the plots manipulated the viewer and left him "flat" (the sequence of the Marais, the sequence of the seller of hairstyles, to give two examples). The good and uplifting: The sequence of Mime, the cemetery, the Montmartre (though it was too much for the viewer to understand), the "Cowboy" vignette and the Sacre Coeur - seemed few and far between, and I would have liked to have seen an actor as wonderful as Orlando Bloom being in something that would show his originality more.
