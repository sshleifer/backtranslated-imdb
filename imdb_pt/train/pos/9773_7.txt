The plot is really horrible, the atmosphere really depressive, unusual for such low budget production and at least for a German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mystical thriller and mixed horror film. The plot and character development are great, the sets very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. It could be perfect but unfortunately some things have been a little disappointing, which inevitably does not have to be typically for low budget films: 1.) The cast sometimes is not more than average. . Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do a good job, or very good, but some are acting like actors of bad shows of the German court! But I was very, very disappointed with the performance of Mathieu Carri√®re! His acting (in many of his older films, his acting was good) here was below average! But that may be the reason why he currently participates in bad German soaps or TV series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogues are sometimes at the novel level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound made it sometimes very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and I was happy to be able to come back and listen to it again. Caused by the whole (large halls as in the hospital or with the group esoterically) and sometimes with the strange dialects of the actors! <br /> <br /> But, despite everything, it's an interesting movie, worth seeing, far beyond commercial films, which are usually more terrible.
