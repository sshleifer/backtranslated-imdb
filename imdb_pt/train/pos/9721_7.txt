How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a bit of a romantic approach. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) breaking into journalist and magazine writing business that is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg made an appearance OK, a little worse than usual. The movie is not hilarious or funny or anything like it, but it has its moments, and those moments are really hilarious. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching American comedy with English to all people who just want to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you are about to watch this movie with a critical approach then you should move on unless you want to be disappointed and start destroying it.
