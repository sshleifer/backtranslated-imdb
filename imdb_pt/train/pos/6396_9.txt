Do you think you had difficulties? You should check out this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a Navy Diver should be an inspiration to all of us. And significantly, after seeing this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as always, is good as the southern horseman who trains him. George Tillman, in only his second feature (after "Soul Food"), made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to check this out.
