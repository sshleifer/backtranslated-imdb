This film is a true reflection of the Australian resourcefulness that was necessary to make this country what it is in the last 200 years. Not pompous like the British, nor Gung-Ho like the Americans. If any of these countries had tried what this team did, it would have failed. Or because of the ignorance of the British side, or too much faith in superior firepower on the American side. True (non-imported) Australians are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
