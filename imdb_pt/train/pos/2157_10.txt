OK. As you can see, this is one of my favorite movies, if not favorites. This is a character drama that is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a business man who is stuck in a "same thing, different day" mentality. He sees a woman looking gloomily through a window of a dance studio on her train every day and wonders about it and decides to find out more about it. He decides to join the dance class only to find out that she is not the instructor. From there, he joins four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing, as well as discovering the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no free sex (or any) involved, as a small group of people learn. as friendships are formed and developed. <br /> <br /> This movie was redone with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one, though appealing, is not as enjoyable as the original. The film has never been successful in the United States because it was not eligible for an Oscar since it was aired on Japan (movies can not be released on TV or disqualified for Oscar nominations). He has won numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director, etc. for his "Oscar" awards.
