The gang of roses. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> A mix of old western and hip hop, blended perfectly together. The clothing styles, the scenery and the plot are all appropriate to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - In five years, they stole twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without a trace. Now a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it's personal. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five women who vie after five years of walking together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends up reuniting her friends one more time and following a trail of revenge. <br /> <br /> A good version of the western. (If you've seen Bad Girls, well, that's a little better in the forms of the female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave 10/10 because the characters, plot and scenario did it for me.
