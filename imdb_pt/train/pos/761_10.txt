I just want to say that among all the so-called hiphop classic movies I've seen, like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Wars Style etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among the others. Whenever I ask other people about what their favorite is, then it looks like BEAT STREET appears more. But still, it is the lowest of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (If you say, 5 points is the belt). I love musical performances, breakdancing makes me want to spin, RAMO makes me want to play a piece ... come on, it's a classic !!!
