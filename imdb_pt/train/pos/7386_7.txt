Okay, so the Oscars seem to get a little more excited every year. And I was rooting for "Gosford Park" to win (come on, Robert Altman deserved an Oscar for years!). That said, I think it was time for an African American to win the award for best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, the role of Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than that of Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I would never have thought of naming the latter for anything, especially in a year that saw "Mulholland Dr.". <br /> <br /> Among the things I had anticipated were the material on the September 11 attacks; I knew they were going to say something about freedom. Yes. Robert Redford should know better. But contrary to the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the previous hosts was Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I really enjoyed her jab in John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So, while I would not have given "A Beautiful Mind" Best Picture, "the 74th Annual Academy Awards" still pleased me (I have to admit, I like Oscar more than my own birthday ). And the next day when my parents and I were walking through the residences in Bandalier, New Mexico - it was spring break - I was thinking to myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people watching asked "Jim who? "I wonder if Woody Allen will ever go to the Oscars again.
