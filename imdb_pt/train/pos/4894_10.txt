I grew up during the time when the music in this movie was popular. What a wonderful moment for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. I think it feels like I'm living in the past, (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong with that? !!? World War II was a terrible time, except where the song was concerned. The death of Glenn Miller was a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be one of my favorites. Clio Laine was excellent; what voice! I do not know how I missed this movie. My main reason for this comment is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a try!
