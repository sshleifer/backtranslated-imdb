This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely incredible. I saw tonight on the Turner Classic Movie Channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy on DVD. The filming of the movie does not look as blurry as you might think of B & W's 1925 silent film. Set in Iran in 1925, the nomad people in the documentary leave their home in the desert and cross a mighty river, men, women, children, animals ... Then up and on a mountain of snow all pass barefoot. It is sinking or swimming and rising or dying. In search of grass for your animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man is carrying a mule that is too sick to climb the mountain. The children in the documentary look happy and healthy. They had such a difficult life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. It makes you appreciate modern life in the USA.
