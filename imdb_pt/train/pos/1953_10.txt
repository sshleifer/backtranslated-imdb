Since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well, it was scary how real he really was! The acting is what gave the film that leads to greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton played the main character, Patsy McCartle, who had two children she adored. His performance is what made the real-life story come to life on a television screen. It was very difficult to watch some of the scenes, as they were as real as what happens when someone becomes addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just watching this loving mother go from sweet to not caring was difficult but so true. I met people who went through the recession and it was very much like what happened in this movie, as far as I can remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was too risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. However, it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who has met someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or who simply learns what can happen if you become addicted to them. .
