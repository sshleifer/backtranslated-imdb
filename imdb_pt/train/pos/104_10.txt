This movie had an interesting cast, it did not have a cast of a list, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have movies like this, the story is basic, the actors are basic and this is how they perform it, you do not need a million dollar budget to make a movie just a mix of ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what I found interesting was that they did not close a cafe to sort things out and they did everything from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen did a great job of playing roles in the hostage situation. This was a great movie and I hope to see more like it in the near future.
