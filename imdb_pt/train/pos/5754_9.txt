I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight years old. I must have found the characters because they left an impression on my mind that lasted a long time after the end of the movie. And the end, now that it's sad, well ... for a boy of 7 to 8 years. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie again lately, and found that the plot was very simple, the character, two-dimensional ... I think it's the kind of movie you can only with innocence of a small child ... Pity ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this to all parents with small children ... (I saw in its original version in French, so I can not tell if the translation is good or not).
