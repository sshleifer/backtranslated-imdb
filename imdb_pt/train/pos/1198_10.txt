Like most reviewers, I saw this movie for the first time (on TV, never on the big screen) when I was a teenager. My father always considered this film highly and recommended it to me, and I must say that it was not only right, but this film remained with me forever in the more than two decades since I first saw it. I have seen it two or three times since (a few days ago I gave the other watch) and he has not lost any of the impact over time. Still a great and worth seeing movie! Manr considers Peckinpah's Ride the High Country as one of the earliest and most recent westerns, which had a realistic look at life in the Old West, but the ill-known LAST HUNT is definitely the best movie and it was up to half a dozen years before. In fact, it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time, or maybe it's still ... <br /> <br /> Despite thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of the western (I like this genre) I can not remember of no western as gloomy and depressing as this. Two men united, partly out of hatred, partly because they did not seem to have other choices, surrounded by the beautiful Mrs. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian, taking the life of the buffalo killers until fate came to one of them. <br /> <br /> Nobody who has seen this movie can forget its final and the last frames of this jewel. When the camera moves away from Mr. Taylor, a white buffalo skin appears (in a tree) and echoes of the past, when all hatred began, are present again. Mr. Taylor has his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him. <br /> <br /> In addition to the best performances of all involved, the smart script and the great dialogue, should also be mentioned, that THE LAST HUNT is superbly portrayed, I rarely saw a western so well photographed (apart from those directed by Anthony Mann, who are also all superbly photographed), that all venues are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits nicely into the photo. <br /> <br /> And director BROOKS is really an excellent storyteller. . Master skill! He made a good pair of great movies and was successful in almost every genre imaginable, but even in such a prolific career as this, THE LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not his best. It would definitely deserve a higher rating, compared to the 7-something that the RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY likes.
