I really loved this movie and also the audience I saw in Los Angeles. After the movie, many people cried and said how much the film had affected them. I can see why it was a huge success in his homeland, Sweden. The film is mastered and each character is brilliantly drawn so that, in the end, you really get to know these people and worry about them. The music is very natural and the main song of the film is rather bleak but inspiring. I definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see - even people who do not usually go to subtitled movies. It definitely deserved the Oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected unpretentiously in a small-town community with ordinary people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. A MUST SEE!
