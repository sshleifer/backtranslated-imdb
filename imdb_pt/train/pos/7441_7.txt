Personally, I despise the Jerry Springer Show, however, I found "Ringmaster" to be the funniest movie I've ever seen this year. Jerry Springer's endless satire "guests" starting at the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a weak attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for pure entertainment value.
