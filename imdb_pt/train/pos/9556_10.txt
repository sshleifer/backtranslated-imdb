When our local TV station was launched for the first time, it filled most of its programming with the old British programming. "Arrest your daughters!" was duly displayed, and I - influenced by the first few seconds of the film - I popped a blank tape. The best thing I ever did. <br /> <br /> The actors are very well adapted to their characters and bring them to a pleasurable life, complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Fenington will leave you in points, just like Hoyden and his family). There are many dual paths, story wheels inside wheels blend and match the characters, hilarious vision jokes lurk in every scene, and spicy comments are made regularly. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called it "a lost treasure" for both the cast and the story. To this day I can laugh just thinking about the dialogue. If this gem gets to a DVD release, I'll be in front of the line.
