I saw this movie once as a child in the late-afternoon show and I fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took more than 30 years, but recently I found it on DVD - it was not cheap, or - in a catalog specializing in war films. We watched it last night for the first time. The audio was fine, however, it was grainy and had the trailers between reels. Still, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed by how true it was to the play. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are sincere in finding him, send me a letter and I will see if I can give you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
