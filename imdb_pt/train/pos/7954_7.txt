Great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this movie very good. The addition of "character" to the three main animals gives the story much more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older man, Shadow, and the young hellraiser, Chance. Previous versions of this film have been unable to give the animals any real personality or motif, which is perfectly done here. Sally Field is adorable in anything but really shines in this movie as the proud feline Sassy. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm caresses to make the plot and resolution excellent. There is even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for a night alone or with the kids. Let's take the hat to Disney.
