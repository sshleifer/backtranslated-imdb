This movie caught me by surprise when it started at a cafe located in Arizona and a Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", '04, decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered with a very hot, sexy waitress. As Rex leaves the Cafe, he sees a state trooper and asks him, "ARE YOU FAST?" and then all hell breaks loose in many ways. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", 80, is a TV reporter and is always looking for news to air. Maggie ends up in a hot tub and Rex comes calling her to say he wants a show down, western style, with the local cop in town. This is a different movie, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together!
