I grew up watching Full House as a kid. I stopped watching for years, but two weeks ago I started watching again. Now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it too. My kids can not believe that DJ, show, and I are the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love the show because it's a show you can watch with your family. You have good teachings that your children can learn. There is also no drug and violence about it. In addition, when children in the program have a problem, they can always open up to help the family. This is the message children should receive from TV today, to ask for help from their family, not from drugs. Kids should be watching more shows like Full House, instead of half the TV mess these days. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it's to the earth. Talk about real-life problems and family matters. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote on the show for 10.
