This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup d'Ã©tat and some Irish documentary filmmakers are well into it. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the Constitution is being vilified by the private media openly as dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc., without repercussions (such as silencing them through bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they still claim they are being repressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media boast of their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they overthrew the government with the help of rouge. generals (how much more stupid can you get?). <br /> <br /> And see how the people of Venezuela march to the palace, holding the Constitution in their hands and reinstalling their elected government. <br /> <br /> This sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it actually happened, against the explicit wishes of the USA. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, taken from the center of the action, acute and utterly embarrassing to the main supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, kind, and benevolent USA (who still channel large sums of money to Chavez). ). <br /> <br /> Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
