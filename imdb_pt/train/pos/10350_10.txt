I believe they were telling the truth all the time ... I can not trust anything in the wild ... The family went through hell. Those poor boys were too young to understand what was going on around them. But still having to deal with the rumors. Besides dealing with the loss of your little sister. I can not believe this case went on for too long. It seems the jury could not see the truth, even if it bit them in the ass. I feel for this family, and if I could let them know, I hate what happened to them, I would. I have no idea what they went through, I can not even imagine it. After watching this movie, I was crying and had to check my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch.
