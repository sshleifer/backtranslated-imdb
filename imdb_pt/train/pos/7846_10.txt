I'm not usually much into a specific show (except for The OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But no kidding, after a Reunion episode I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how much I was upset about having come into conflict with Bush's speech last night because I was really looking forward to the 1987 episode which now airs next Thursday, market. Again, this conflict was disadvantageous because, being a new program, it needs to create followers and having the second episode delayed a week kills a little. <br /> <br /> Having said that, TV does not always have to be Emmy worthy of being fun. I do not expect the Reunion to bring home any awards, but I hope it can capture my attention throughout the season. Ever watched the first episodes of a beloved show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you got hooked. The construction of characters takes some time. <br /> <br /> The only episode for each year is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show that I remember doing something like that is 24, with each episode being one hour ... and having a busy year is more realistic than such a busy day! Please give this show a chance. Relax on the art form ... it's just TV!
