IQ is a romantic comedy with two great actors that seem to click well on the screen. The plot is a typical guy wrong for the girl, the boy is in the shape of a girl, but it makes the solid point that one should love with the heart and not with the mind. Addition of Albert Einstein and his bunch of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. Overall, a good movie. Not good, but good.
