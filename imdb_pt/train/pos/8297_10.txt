An elegant film pulled in two directions. To his advantage, it is directed by Wes Craven. On the downside, the budget for the TV movie shows what could have been a lot more with a bigger budget. He moves while Susan Lucci pulls Robert Urichfamily to his clutches and tries to convince him to get into the secret of his health club. His latest invention, a spacesuit that can analyze people or things, becomes unexpectedly useful in its new neighborhood. Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Its appearance and performance had an unexpected repercussion some years later. Actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. Lucci became subject of a portrait he followed as the basis of works of an assistant named Catherine. The portrait of Lucci and Barbara Steele in 'Black Sunday' was used as references for the portraits of Catherine that were immediately withdrawn by Armourae. Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine. So when we see the two films, we can get a vision of another story and the appearance of an unknown woman that would make an interesting movie.
