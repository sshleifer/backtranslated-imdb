I had never heard of The Man in the Moon until I saw you last night on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorites range from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove to Ghost and Mrs. Muir, to The Wizard of Oz and The Beloved, Eraserhead, The Rewards Man and The Inner Spy. <br /> <br /> The Man on the Moon is superbly made, a good-hearted, gay and tragic, beautifully filmed movie in which the actors actually live in the moment, instead of acting. This sweet tale will soon be in our private library. This beautiful history of life in a much finer era in rural Louisiana literally transports you into your pastoral environment. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to remain stoic during the last moments of the movie, especially when the girl the extension of her older sister's heart is burning pain and forgives everything. <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling pleasure or boring you with sobs with my insipid prose, you will end now with this suggestion of those who like movies that speak from the heart to ours. If you do not buy any other movie, please buy Man on the Moon. This heartwarming story is one that you will enjoy reliving over and over again. It is a joy and a jewel, a very scarce film in this world of hardened hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues evidenced in Man in the Moon are a joy to contemplate. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
