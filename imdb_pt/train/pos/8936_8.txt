After "Beau Travail," everyone was waiting for Claire Denis to do a follow-up masterpiece that never came. Now it has. Denis takes a quantum leap in this film, a stunning cinematic orgy, elliptical edition, and intentionally obscures narrative events that seem strange and even stranger. There is a nominal plan (derived in part from Jean-Luc Nancy's book of the same name) about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and looking for a Tahitian son whom he long ago abandoned; but mainly is an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes a couple of previews to understand and has rhythm problems near the end, but it's still more advanced and exciting than anything else I've seen this year. Lose your risk.
