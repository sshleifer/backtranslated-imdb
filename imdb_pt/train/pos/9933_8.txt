If you are in need of an escape, something that will catch your attention for two hours and allow you to get lost in another world, Domino will meet that need. This is entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it for the second time to find out everything. I wondered about Domino Harvey, how his life became of interest to Hollywood. As for acting, many celebrity appearances are not shown in the trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who they are did his job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a football uniform or pirate costume. And granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being able to take care of other people.
