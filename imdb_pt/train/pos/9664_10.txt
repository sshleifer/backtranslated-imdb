Bette Midler shows off her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am very happy to have recorded and I can see whenever I want. It has what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. Your voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was her singing "Stay With Me" from her 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the excitement in the song and you will end up having chills. The show will leave you wanting to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
