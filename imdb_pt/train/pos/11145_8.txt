After racism, the rural exodus - also known as country-side migration - is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story dealt with racism for a love party in an artistic vision. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with the rural exodus by a tragedy of friendship in a psychological vision. It has a deeply painful ending that we witnessed one of the two companions of fate dying. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger cleverly delivers us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York cities. scaffolding. While the handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women in the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better, healthier life in clean, sunny Florida. Consequently, Joe becomes a drug dealer to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a thief to collect enough money to migrate to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find the way to do what he can. They begin to share everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share an uninhabited house, share their earnings and share a destination. Regrettably, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being cute is not the only thing that makes every beautiful woman beg him to have fun; and in addition Ratso has not been able to see Florida since his heart failed defeating his illness while he was on the bus taking him there. <br /> <br /> Power is always right, and the weak have no right to daylight. Hence, "Midnight" gives the factual insight. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
