Although I can not claim to be a comic book fanatic, I read my part, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this movie, and I was not disappointed. He runs out of energy near the end, is almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Blue Raja from Hank Azaria can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all those flaws when you have a movie that's a lot of fun. All the actors seem to be enjoying their roles, especially William H. Macy as the Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how the disco was the music of choice for the bandits; somehow, seemed appropriate.
