this is really a pleasure for all Bolan fans, some may think it's a little overdone, and that's just about the egos of Ringo and Marc, but I think it's similar to any other show video except for the fact that this is Marc Bolan, not just any guy! I especially liked the music video for the children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. only this clip is worth all the money, I can not believe they did not release this version as a single. The film is really great, especially for us Danes. Now, I was not alive during the '70s. But the Danes in general were totally expelled from what was going on around them. the media did not play or show any of the popular music of the time, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a little with The Doors, just the really popular songs. so I know of my father, that seeing this, returns him a part of his youth, he never had the experience. <br /> <br /> I will not do this for long, so ... If you are the least fan of Marc Bolan, you need to see this. You may find it boring or as has been said before, just above the top. But at least you saw one of the greatest musicians of all time, in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me a bit is that Ride The White Swan is not on tape. but I forgive, since Jeepster and Get It On are so beautifully touched.
