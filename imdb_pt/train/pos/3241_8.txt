Action. Comedy. Thriller This movie has it all. <br /> <br /> The plot says that four professional thieves are invited to participate in an assault on a small town in Montana. All kinds of crime archetype characters are here. Frank, the mastermind. Carlos, the weapons specialist. Max, the explosives specialist. Nick, the safe cookie, and Ray, the man in the car. Unfortunately for Frank, he is arrested by two clumsy detectives (portrayed very well by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who are chasing him from New Jersey after he sends the letters to the other 4. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the train station and from the beginning none of them like or trust each other. Added to the mix is ​​the fact that Frank is gone and they are not sure why they called it together. <br /> <br /> Now Frank is being taken back to New Jersey by the 2 detectives, but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems. <br /> <br /> Truly a great movie loaded with laughter and great acting. Just a good movie for those looking for a laugh or something a little different
