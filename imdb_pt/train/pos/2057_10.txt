There was not a day in 2002 where I was not chased by a scarecrow I felt this movie dealt with a serious issue as well <br /> <br /> It brought back many memories as it was so realistic <br / > Even today I have nightmares about corn cob, and I can not even get close to the tinned stuff for fear of my life <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at one point in the I had to turn it off when came too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who were never attacked by a scarecrow, watching this movie you could be educated about what it was like for us victims <br /> <br /> This movie in teaches not to give life as guaranteed or to mess with corn, believe me, I've been there and I have the scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, its incredible and educational
