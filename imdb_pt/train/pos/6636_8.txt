It is totally useless to evaluate this movie. It is as if you condemn (or praise) the newborn for your future life. Instead, look at it as a powerful meditation on what might have been and what has been in the last 100 years. One hundred and eight years of cinematography: what happened to the baby? I like to contemplate what would have (creatively) happened had Europe not been interrupted (devastated) twice by the great wars of the twentieth century. On top of it, ruins of the fake neon castle of the non-creative and reactionary circus called Hollywood were erected.
