Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From late night lodging with Penn and Teller to the one, the only, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me awake on Friday nights in my high school years, and provided some of the best car memories to get out of the drive-in. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly the best late night television ever. If you did not stay awake, you were losing. <br /> <br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob are alive, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... did anyone else sit during the 4 hours of "The Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
