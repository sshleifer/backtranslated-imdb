This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. The cuts in the plot may disappoint fans of the book (but in fact, how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a version for the film first? I know only a few). <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty shocking to see critical reviews of the series that were clearly written by people who have no idea about the story - you actually saw the series or you just bought a BBC Production because Was Gillian Anderson in the new version? <br /> <br /> The series captures the mood, rhythm, characters, and surroundings (cutting out Dickensian flourishes that are not needed and damaging a movie treatment like the Turveydrop story, the Smallweed family dynamics and the extra lawyers - Tangle, Vholes etc are very truncated). The only omission I would have liked to have been kept was the Jellyby incident, but since the first episode is already a bit slow (after the first episode, the pace is perfect), I can see that it had to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Jo's death could have been more faithfully done. I can see that he would practically have canonized Woodcourt and he has remained a little more human for not having that scene, but I really think that Jo's death is one of the most touching points of the book and I missed it even though it always makes me cry. Theowinthrop really saw the series? How does he think Esther was raised by her aunt and UNCLE? Who is this uncle? I suppose someone who could confuse Dennis Eliott's name with Desmond is not really a fan of English art (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think it confuses the treatment of the law. YES, the law is drawn VERY poorly at Bleak House. He fails the descendants of Jarndyce, whose valuable heritage is devoured by the costs of litigation, fails the late Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all who have faith in the lawsuit. He failed Miss Flyte. In a way, Captain Hawdon also fails, who is brought to his death by the monotony of the work of copyist of the law. Yes, that feeds the Vholes and Tangle pickers. But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to go beyond their position in life. Despite not being kind to social status climbers, Dickens clearly would have preferred that they not get stuck in the season they were born (contrast Jo and the families of brick-makers with the escalation of poverty by Charley Neckett). <br /> <br /> In addition, the law, though misused by Tulkinghorn vultures and the Chancellery, is in fact the source of safety for the court wings Ada and Richard, and for Esther, who is simply the wing by Jarndyce. Their security has been assured by the law that delivers them to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can not see how anyone could have trouble following the story - remember that you should not realize that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock the beginning. Nor should you "catch" all connections immediately. Instant gratification does not happen in Dickens. <br /> <br /> As for "seeing clearly" through the fog, Gillian Anderson made such a meager edition that I found it impossible to follow and already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant (overacting and drama is not a good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they try the version of Gillian Anderson). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick is not "Kate"! and you get everything you need from the Rouncewell subframe.
