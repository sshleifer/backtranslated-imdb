Talk about an explosive opening, "Infernal Trap" has the best opening credits ever! Guided by musical tones that are perhaps somewhat inspired by the legendary "Friday the 13th" theme (Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the protagonists appear on screen divided into giant syllables. Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller and it only gets colder with each passing minute. Two extremely competitive paintball enemies overwhelmed with testosterone challenge each other for the ultimate showdown on a despicable bar. According to a newspaper article, there is a wild bear loosened in the nearby forest and has already killed several of the hunters who tried to catch him. The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the macho hero with the largest set of balls. On arrival, however, it quickly becomes obvious that they do not face a bear, but a bewildered and completely manic war veteran with an arsenal of weapons in their hiding place and countless combat tricks on their sleeve. After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers, this Mexican effort from the early 1990's looks and is very refreshing and vivid. The formula is simplistic but efficient, the main characters are plausible enough and the construction for clashes with the sadistic killer is reasonably suspenseful. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as he also wears a self-made glove with sharp knives and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasantly unpleasant and barbarous, which I had really expected since the opening opening sequences, and I wasted much free blood. The forest environment and particularly the camouflaged traps are blissfully spectacular. "Trap Internal" is a hit Mexican slasher / survival that comes warmly recommended to fans of the genre.
