Pandora watch is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a frighteningly real picture in the novel, is even more so here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for TV, this is first class entertainment. The cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson leaves the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to this day. Jane Leeves excels in her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a terrific dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and although the character is a man in the book, works amazingly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the support cast are excellent and fit into their counterparts on the card. <br /> <br /> There are changes in the story, of course (including a small change). in the end), but these changes are for the better when compared to the novel. The plot is realistic and much to see to believe in the way it is presented, making this the best airplane movie since the original movie from the airport. Production figures are high, and while special effects may look as good as a decade ago, they work well. The sets are great, especially the CIA HQ and the Oval Office, showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time doing the work. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if you see this first and read, then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will not regret losing four hours for this movie and how long it takes to read the novel. It will take your breath away.
