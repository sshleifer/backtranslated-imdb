"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical account, a heroic story and a vision of the cultural context of a great event in history. Denzel Washington not only does a great job of being a determined and motivating hero, Steve Biko, but also sends a message to the public about the horrors of South African Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader and his main "influential", Donald Woods, is to cut the heart. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" can communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It is because of great films like this that the public can be educated about terrible events in history, great leaders who have tried to do away with them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is an incredible movie that must be seen by everyone.
