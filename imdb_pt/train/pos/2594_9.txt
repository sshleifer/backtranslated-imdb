This film took Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman power. "Wilder Napalm" is the type of film based on themes that I love, addressing the idea that prodigies in America are defined by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film shows that every wonder is only human and should not be feared or worshiped more than any other human being. This was a great comedy, fun and humane, with that slight satirical advantage.
