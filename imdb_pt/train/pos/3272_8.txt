Coming from the same director who did "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", it does not surprise me that it's a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie I've never heard of before, but it must be one of the best films of the late 1980s - in part because it's the worst movie period in the last few decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The acting is not brilliant, but just solid - contrary to what some people here claim (they must have dreamed of this "wonderful performance" as well as Anna). History is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that unites all the loose ends. These unanswered questions are probably left on purpose, leaving them to the individual's interpretation, and there is nothing wrong with it, with a theme like that. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual blend of children's horror film, with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not her typical movie clich√© ultra-shy, but secretly-brilliantly-socially excluded girl, but a normal, normal boy; very refreshing. I'm sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfortunes into their books and screens, as if someone else cared to watch or read about another miserable, solitary childhood, as if that were all there is or as if this guy were background character holds a monopoly of good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy "kissing" (for a long time) was a little too much - evoking feelings of vague disgust and amusement - considering that she should be only 11 years old, but predictably Burke was 13 or 14 years old when was filmed. I have no idea why they have not improved the character's age or have gained a younger actress. It was obvious that Burke is not so young. Why directors always put kids older than they touch, hence dilute realism, I'll never know.
