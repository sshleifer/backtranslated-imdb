I really have to say, this was always one of my favorites when I went to see my grandmother. And it still is. It's very, very close to the book. The way it's filmed, and the players were all excellent! I have to recommend this movie to everyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but that was great! I gave 10/10.
