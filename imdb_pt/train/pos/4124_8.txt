Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were the stars of this series. Which made it so good for me when I saw it was the real feel of going underwater. The show exhibits a young energy energy for underwater exploration, which is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was educational as well as showing the viewer things about diving from someone who seemed to be an accomplished professional, Mike Nelson. There were great shows, and the show always seemed well-produced. Granted, the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode, but each show holds its own with any other program produced during this time, the childhood of American television.
