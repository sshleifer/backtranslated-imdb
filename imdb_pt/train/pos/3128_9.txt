Corny! I love it! Corny - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt rekindle the same chemistry on the screen that seems never to have come out! They relive old memories, and the actors who play them in the 60s show some things behind the scenes that are very interesting to know. TV from the 1960s was tacky escapism for so many of us back then, and this DVD is no exception if you're familiar with the original TV show. The fight scene with Boofs and Bams written or whatever is fantastic !! The movie scene shows clips of the villains who passed away. In the end, Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. He died not long after this DVD was made, I believe, so it's to his great credit that he returned to playing a villain for Adam and Burt, just as he did with Batman & Robin so many years ago. He did not lose touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar for having revived the villain role as well. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for great memories, and I would like to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and re-creating those memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thank you guys !!!
