"La Bête", by Walerian Borowczyk, is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress promised to the son of an impoverished Marquis, arrives at the castle in ruins and discovers a mythical ursina beast intended to prowl the nearby forest. It is legendary that an old lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and Lucy is consumed by dreams of the incident. "The Beast" is an artistic mix of surreal horror, explicit sleaze and pornography. There is implosion of bestiality, aggression and perversion in the priesthood, copious false ejaculation spread on bare breasts, masturbation with a rose and, most graphics of all, the homonymous beast playing with unbelievably great phallus. Yet this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and without taste. The women here are incredibly beautiful and they are naked most of the time. In general "La Bête" is a visual feast. Whatever the fetishistic attention to detail, or the visual motifs pregnant with information, the masterpiece of Borowczyk should be viewed with care and attention. A must-see for fans of European cult cinema.
