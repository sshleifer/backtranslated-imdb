The DOUBLE EXHIBITION was a tremendous surprise. It contains excellent acting (particularly of Callan's underestimated), cinematography and a compelling storyline. In other words, it is one of the best terror efforts ever made in the 1980s. Callan plays a fashion photographer who dreams of murdering his models, at a time when he meets with his psychologically volatile brother . (who lacks an arm and a leg). When the models that Callan dreams of killing actually appear dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie never received praise. deserve. Most critics and film buffs get involved with the horde of horror films released at the same time, but it is well above most of that unfortunate plot. It's clever and unique, which is not something you can say comfortably about most movies of that genre, but it's also done and executed with passion. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a jewel of your kind.
