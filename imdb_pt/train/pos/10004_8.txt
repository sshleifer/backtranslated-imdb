This is not the comedian Robin Williams, nor is it the quirky / insane Robin Williams of the recent fame of the thriller. This is a classic drama hybrid without undue dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love for suspense. But this is not a suspense by itself. This is more of a mystery / suspense vehicle through which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his guardian. Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama is very much like a reportage, until William The character comes close to reaching his goal. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was very entertained, although this film does not teach, guide, inspect or enjoy. It seemed more like I was watching a guy (Williams) as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective.
