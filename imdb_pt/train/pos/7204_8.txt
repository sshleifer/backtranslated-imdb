It is a play adapted to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the beautiful home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a fabulously successful Broadway play, but his last four efforts have failed - horribly. An aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a workshop sent him a copy of the play he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon) that the play is fabulous - an infallible success. But is it good enough to die? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> Clever dialogue and countless plot twists keep this movie entertaining from start to finish. The whole cast seems to have a good time. It is reminiscent of another fun mystery of Michael Caine: Sleuth. It's worth watching. <br /> <br />
