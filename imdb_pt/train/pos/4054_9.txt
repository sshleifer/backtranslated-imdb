The first time I saw this movie was in the 80's as a little boy. My dad really did record on TV. I must have watched more than 20 times before the relatively recent release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course I bought and watched the DVD and was amazed how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very somber. However, the new version, with Van Der Beek et al, is more comical. <br /> <br /> Put another way, it's like watching Akira's original release with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal Japanese translation. <br /> <br /> I am not at all complaining, the story and the quality of the animation are not impaired, but raises the question of whether Miyazaki intended a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film .... .
