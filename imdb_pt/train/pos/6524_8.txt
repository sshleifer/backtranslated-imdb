<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirated movies, New Orleans / early 19th century American history, or Yul Brynner, watch this movie and decide on it. Do not get carried away by several dull comments. My reaction to her was that she is funny, well represented (most of the time), has a very witty dialogue and does a great job of portraying the charm, attraction and legendary fascination of privateer Jean Lafitte. Although not all of the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me some historical film that succeeds in that?), I feel that the film is accurate in its treatment of the role that Lafitte played in the history of New Orleans, and love hate relationship between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Do not worry about what the film does not do, but watch what it does, that is, by studying one of the most intriguing historical figures in New Orleans and America.
