I saw the movie a few days ago on a videotape and even though it was hard to swallow at one time (because of its duration and story), I really enjoyed it. I was impressed first by the script and then by the completion of this script. The movie takes you on a tour, but this is not an easy and joyous ride; passes through time and by different political regimes and shows their influence in the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the internal logic that the film followed; Logic, which, like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and twists made sense. It does not make sense to try to recount the story as it spreads over more than 50 years. I also really liked the character of Nikita Mikhalkov, Aleksei, and the way he played, as some critics saw, with restless abandon. What I did not like about it was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and the Injured" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows, I think, that great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before going to Hollywood and making forgettable films like "Tango and Cash" and less forgettable like "Runaway Train". I would prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
