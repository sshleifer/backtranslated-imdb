This Oscar nominee for 2004 is a short film in black and white in Spanish. A young woman enters a cafe, drinks coffee and notices some musicians standing in silence with their instruments. All the patrons are still, like dummies. One guy, however, is quite cheerful and breaks a song about what happens at 7:35 am. There is one surprising moment after another until the end, which is quite surprising. The people, the place, everything seems quite ordinary. And like the musical piece "Bolero", the thing keeps growing until the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and intelligence, it is an 8 minute masterpiece.
