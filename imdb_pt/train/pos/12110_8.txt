For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping students, think again. There is an entirely different side to Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a sweet nature tale of a boy with the gift of making delicious bread. His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match the famous European breads. The show is as crazy as they come and I'm sure non-Japanese viewers will miss many of the jokes. But it is still very good to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! It is not unusual for people to look like they just had an orgasm after eating bread. Bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide variety of super powers, from time travel to swimming like a fish. This strange aspect becomes one of the least predictable and funny shows I've seen in a while.
