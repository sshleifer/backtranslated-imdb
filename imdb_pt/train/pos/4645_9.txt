This movie is very interesting. I've seen it twice and it looks like Glover hit the nail in the head with what he claims to want to do. I can at least relate to the indignation that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current unreflective corporate nonsense that is an attack on all our media centers, and the things that we as a culture should not "think" about because of control of corporate media. The outrage that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is clear in his visceral and beautiful aggressiveness in his poetic potency. I'm happy to have seen this movie and it's even clearer that Glover is preparing something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. It's ok! EVERYTHING IS GOOD. See that too. People who dismiss this movie as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" are really missing the boat. This is a clever film. If you can see him with his live show, he performs before with his books, which is also very angry. The way you get into your mindset is really something. You will have an experience!
