I'll be honest. I got this movie so I could make fun of it. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction could I have? The thing is, however, the film (and its creators) decided that this would not be fun. Instead, he would do his best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? He came very close. A little less cheese in incidental music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, incidents (such as props - love the Best Buy bag) ... well, there is a classic zombie movie genre but still It's a really cool little movie on its own. And the acting, the writing and the rhythm are surprisingly better than I expected. There's even a decent mood, as two of our leaders debate how to decide if a dead zombie is actually dead. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the low budget (which leaves your fingerprints on everything, unfortunately) and the Curse almost constant, this can be a very fun time in the movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the creators, the actors, the team, all tried to make a good movie (instead of a classic of the camp) and that counts a lot. The line of exaggerated zombie movies is a mile long, and thanks, guys, for not adding anything. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Quiroz brothers. I'd love to see what they do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
