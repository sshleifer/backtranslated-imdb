Lars Von Trier is never too late to experiment with new techniques. Some of them are very original while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He portrays post-war Germany as a nightmare train journey. With so many ruined cities, Leo Kessler, a young American of German descent, feels obliged to assist in his restoration. It is not a simple task, as he quickly discovers. <br /> <br /> Your uncle finds a job as a night driver on the Zentropa Railway Line. Their job is to meet the needs of the passengers. When the shoes are polished, a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument occurs when a passenger's shoes are not marked despite the fact that they have been polished. There are many allusions to German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details. <br /> <br /> The train journey is like an allegory representing the procession of man throughout his life with all his trials and tribulations. In a sequence, Leo traverses the carriages at the back to discover them full of half-starved bodies that seem to have just escaped Auschwitz. These images, however horrible they may be, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible, yet disjointed, impact. <br /> <br /> In a station called Urmitz Leo jumps off the train with a parcel bomb. In view of many spectators, he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage. He returns to his cabin and makes a connection with a clock. Later he leaps from the train (at high speed) and lies on the fresh grass at a river bank. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. Later, as he saw the train approaching a giant bridge, he sped off to board the train and stop the clock. If you care to analyze the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Very ridiculous indeed. This could only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It's strange how one remembers small details, like a row of cups hanging on hooks and shaking with the train's swing. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer later films by Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above really put me off. Maybe I'm realistic.
