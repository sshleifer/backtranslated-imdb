This is one of the best bonus games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> Missions are a lot of fun to play, they have a lot of action on them, they can be really difficult at times, which makes it even The more fun weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are really good, the driving missions are fun to do. This James Bond game has a good story for that. The voice over the actors in this game is really good and it's cool that Brosnan is present in this game and the characters' looks are really good because they look like they look in real life, which is cool. Also the graphics in this very good game. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********* off **********
