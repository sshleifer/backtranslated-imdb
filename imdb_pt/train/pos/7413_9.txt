Shower holds within itself in many ways. Almost the whole film takes place in an old bathhouse, with the inhabitants supplying the mood, the feelings and the emotional touches. The love and friendship between the owner and his retarded son are deep and moving. The way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unconvincing and persuasive. The plot is winding, full of surprises and ironies, and touched in general by a notion of what I would call neighborhood in the relationships and conflicts of artists. This is a movie that I take when I want to believe in the world again.
