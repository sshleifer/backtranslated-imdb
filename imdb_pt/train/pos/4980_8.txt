While browsing the internet for previous sales prices, I found these comments. Why are they so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I got this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I always felt totally satisfied with it. I showed it to many of my friends and they all loved it too. I feel privileged to have this original black and white film by Shirley from 1932 and 8mm before it became popular or well known. After reading the other reviews, I agree that the movie is "cheeky". Great deal! I just wanted it to be longer. It seems like I should be the only person who owns one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder how much is worth it?
