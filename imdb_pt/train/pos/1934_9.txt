I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula Film Festival, and I was totally taken aback by how much I was involved in it. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the lives of a group of people who take an adult. swimming lesson for various reasons. A good-humored idea by itself, the class serves as a catalyst for major changes in students' lives. What struck me about the movie was just how real it was. Rarely in pieces of sets, the characters are treated so well. I enjoyed the scenes immensely, and the drama that happened outside was very poignant. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character and finally left a very strong feeling, much like school or summer camp - where you meet fast friends, form strong ties, and make discoveries about yourself, you still have to leave very early <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that the character Paula had a very strong and unusual intro that made you want to know a little more about her than was finally revealed. I suppose you do not know everyone in the classroom, though ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I found the film very complete and quite enjoyable. See if you have the opportunity.
