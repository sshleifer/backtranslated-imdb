I did not even want to see this movie after reading the Maltin review and 1 1/2 star rating. I watched anyway on my son's advice and found it much better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss it a lot. I graduated from high school in the year the film was made, so maybe I can relate to it better. Yes, there is some pretense in the movie and it is strange to some extent, but that was in the 70s, so what do you expect. I can see why people may not like the movie; However, I can not understand people saying it is annoying. The movie is anything but annoying. You will hate or love. If you find it annoying, you're probably brain dead.
