The stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing depression almost ruined American musical theater, in fact, was the final blow in vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were hit as badly as the front ones. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate show business economics and his own personal economy, theater director James Cagney comes up with a brilliant idea. Stage live prologues relevant to the movies being shown in various theaters that are popping up during the night of the old theaters. Some other competitors know and the competition is happening. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite movie by Busby Berkeley. This gives James Cagney a chance to show off some of his versatility as a dancer and also as a tough guy. In his retirement, Cagney said that while he exhibited his few and far between musicals, he could hardly be bothered with some of his direct dramatic films. He wished he had done some more musicals in his career and I wish he had. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the staging of these extravagances of Busby Berkeley on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. Dick Powell starts singing three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is here, Honeymoon Hotel, and By the Waterfall, the latter two with Ruby Keeler further solidifying the screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell for the past two years and she partners with James Cagney in my favorite Footlight Parade number, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagney is not a senseless girl Friday in the theater. As in Blonde Crazy, she is the only one with the true brains of the duo and it is his quick thinking that frees him from some domestic problems he has over his theatrical problems. One of Blondell's best roles on screen. Search for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus according to the IMDb pages for both. John Garfield is briefly seen in the Shanghai Lil number. And in a scene at the beginning of the movie, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a Western B movie starring John Wayne. The duke's voice is unmistakable. But what's even more unusual is that the short clip shows it in a scene with Frank McHugh, who plays another assistant to Cagney in Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers were playing around a bit there. I have to believe the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his best surreal.
