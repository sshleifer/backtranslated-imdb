Henry Fool is a better movie. But this is the perfect way to accompany a movie like "Henry Fool." To take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the opening shot of "Henry Fool", when Simon puts his ear to the ground, while Henry walks over the hill, manifests more completely through "Fay Grim." Exaggerated jokes, which are more or less metaphorical (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good, but the opening of the film is a bit saturated in them. Also the use of Dutch angles by Hartley throughout the film is shocking, yes, it is intent, but it seems forced and overused, it goes beyond the shocking, what I would call irritating. It's an imperfect movie, but a must see for any fan of Hartley or Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid criticisms, do not watch unless you've seen the first movie. The intrigue, satire and wit of this movie are totally missed if you have not seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel. That's just stupid.
