This show is wonderful. You have some of the best writing I've ever seen. It has brilliant direction by Dvid Trainer, who also directed another series of intelligent television called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest. Like THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and the famous COSBY SHOW, this will be on television for a long time. <br /> <br /> From your perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would dream of, this is a wonderful show. for people who lived in the seventies and people who did not live. This show attracts the young and the young at heart. A perfect show.
