Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This lesser known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low budget film, almost unknown, but it's one of my all time favorite movies. I discovered that walking down the aisle of the video store, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (which is also great in the movie) appear together. Go get this, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
