Those who are not familiar with the alter-ego of Cassandra Peterson, Elvira, then this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira the Lady of Darkness" begins with our heroine with gravity-defying breasts getting a message. It seems that a great aunt of her died and that she must be present for the reading of the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in the hopes of making lots and lots of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place she has to go to is the town of Fallwell. Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell due to the breakdown of her car, she discovers that her great-aunt left three things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The residents of the city have mixed reactions: teenagers like it, women hate it, and men covet it (despite trying to remain moral pillars of the community). His worst problem ends up being his great-uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) because he wants his cookbook. It looks like the cookbook is a spell book that will make him a more powerful sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The film is really funny, with Peterson aka Elvira using his "dowries" and sensuality as a joke ("And do not forget, tomorrow we'll show our heads with two things ... I mean the thing with two heads "). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who makes the most effort to keep the city on the line, but ends up looking ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). She deserves a peek (The movie, not her breasts, of course).
