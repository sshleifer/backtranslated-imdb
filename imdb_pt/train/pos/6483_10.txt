This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it must be said, maps the beginning to the end of World War II. The origins are not entirely fully examined by the fall of Germany into the hands of the Versailles treaty that helped propel Hitler's demonic rise. But, as one reviewer says, this should be difficult to do in a 26-part series with so much to fit in. <br /> <br /> In addition to the expected action-photography / action, there are many personal things, emotional and human tragedies that are said giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you are not necessarily a fan of World War II . Episodes showing 'testimonies' and how life was in front of the major allies / opponents, England, Germany, Japan, Russia and the US were quite revealing. To show the extreme savagery of war on the front lines and, of course, the suffering of civilians, extermination camps, etc., were treated very well and exposed. I totally recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (from which you can say that I am one at age 47!). <br /> <br /> Certain things are strangely neglected, such as the advent of the new jet era, with the experimental Jet Gloster by Frank Whittle and the premiere in the Gloster Meteor combat, as well as the Messerschmitt Me 262 German - especially when the V-1 was launched and there was surprisingly less mention of V2. This is probably a slight oversight, not referring to the most sensational secret and fantastic weapons that World War II brought from an ancient and sterile science. But a great series that has left its mark and has done so since when happily repeated. <br /> <br /> A series to own as a box set in terms of history, on DVD for anyone especially that happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
