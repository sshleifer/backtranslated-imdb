Of course, because it's a super image and an incredible sound, it's a great home theater "show off" record, but it's also a moving drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this movie will keep all viewers interested. Young, old, boys and girls will discover that deep down we are all automotive fans, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The soundtrack of Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder is perfectly compatible with the visual and content. I do not want to reveal the ending, but the final sequel to Quincy Jones' "Days Like These" can bring a tear to your eyes. Enjoy!
