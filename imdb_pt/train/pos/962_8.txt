I just watched this movie and I must say I was so impressed. Everything was fantastic. The performance of the characters, the story. A believing child who has become brave, always willing to help others. Your mother must be proud. I could not take my eyes off the movie for fear of losing something. It is the prefect fable / tale with moral, cute and scary sprites and 'monsters', but nevertheless folk comforting. A child nudged and bullied at school becoming a hero. Chosen to be a knight at the local village festival and a journey to the Goblin Mountain where he discovers the Yokai, which are incredible creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil Kato and his seamstress who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture the Yokai and throw them into a red hole along with unwanted objects like motorcycles and other mechanical things, and these merge into a horribly violent robotic monster whose only job is to kill. Takashi, a boy, is the only one to become his savior, alongside a red / dragon man, a turtle man and a River Princess, as well as a cute creature who, if it were America, could turn him into a cute toy in all good toy stores. The lines are good, especially the Do not try this at home kids and other jewelry that bring a smile to your lips. Suspend belief and watch it with a child or on your own and enjoy it! Although I must admit that the ending was a bit sad. And not necessarily so. Congratulations Furdion
