I was not sure what to expect from this movie, considering its incredible collection of stars and directors, but in the end it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the final episode with the American tourist. speaking with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better about mine) which was really very touching and a great way to end the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the brothers Coen and Steve Buscemi take the prize. Tom Tykwer's clip was also impressive, though quite ambitious in scope. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hoskins segment was totally credible and the vampire story was completely ridiculous. The dialogue in the Wes Craven section also felt very forced and the history of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth watching the good bits and has a strong ending. It's not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last for 5 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
