Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) wallet pocket of Candy (Jean Peters) which contains an important microfiche that is aimed at the Communist cause. She is being followed by two federal agents who are waiting to attack once she passes the microfiche to her contact. However, Skip steals the bag on the subway under everyone's noses and then begins a hunt for him both by the police and by Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy, who want the microfiche back. Skip can only be traced through Moe (Thelma Ritter), who sells information about criminals. It's clear to Skip that what he stole is important and both sides want the film, but he wants to keep a high price. This leads Joey to hunt after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a well-represented film and it has a good start that involves you right away. It's a bit unrealistic as Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is needed, otherwise why would she later put up with Joey. And a good movie.
