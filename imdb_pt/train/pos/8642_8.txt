An amazingly effective thriller, this one. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful and professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and in an act of compromise, Mulder agrees to change under the condition that, along the way, they visit places of historical interest about the famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words, she takes the photos, with the end result, a best-selling coffee table book that will prepare them for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to split the car and publicize the fact. By chance, Brad Pitt sees the ad and, shortly after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, find the writing couple and begin their journey across the country. Inevitably, evil begins. <br /> <br /> Pitt is excellent as the genuine inspired by the Early Grayce and is supported by Lewis interpreting his usual white trash character that seems to be his default setting. Duchovny and Forbes also make a convincing double act, and as events go out of control, you, as a viewer, are sucked into the situation and can feel the tension mounting. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond its current status. A top movie.
