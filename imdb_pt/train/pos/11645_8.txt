I was in France around March 5, and I love going to these film festivals. I knew about this Cinéma d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never went to it. I decided to go and then I picked up Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. This did not impact on me as with Mexican users, because it was subtitled in French, but still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire on urban violence, about kidnapping and street crime. In Mexico. It is a crude portrait of the city. From a metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a dazzling Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of almost kidnapping, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kind of connection with Cero and van 4. A kind of history of redemption and How much is too much? Man on Fire, which was incredibly strong, was also, not a satire, but a rough picture on the streets of Mexico. Or he's like the brave. A movie that shocks and hits you with great courage. This is like the usual suspects, has some twists, but this makes it even more credible. Verdict: A movie that shocks and makes you believe that there is no more security in the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie that you will not soon forget. It makes you trembling and stunned.
