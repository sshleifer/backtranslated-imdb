I was delighted with this moving and hilarious film, not to mention surprised. I was also surprised to discover that Paulie's voice was performed by Jay Mohr. The performance was so delicate, neither swinging in schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the arrogance of New Jersey, I thought this must be some old professional, not the baby face Mr. Mohr. A very impressive performance, in fact, and it is gratifying to see your talents being taken seriously in a series of indie and quirky films.
