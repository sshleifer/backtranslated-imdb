David Webb Peoples knows Paul Anderson ... if this already seems strange to you then you're right, because it is. <br /> <br /> People are known for their scripts with moral implications of right and wrong, the value of life, etc ... He covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and practically in all his scripts there is something in that sense. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first hit movie was a violent thriller. . Not surprisingly, all his other films! And here's a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /> <br /> Peoples' screenplay is quite apparent in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better genetically modified soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left to die. There he must deal with a group of refugees, some want him to stay, others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN ... <br /> <br /> The bullets begin to fly as the new soldiers move to the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Big, violent, high action follows and People's Roadmap turns into an Anderson action. It's hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the finished product is better than I expected. Fun, in a way, although admittedly not very exciting and exciting when the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: A lot of violence
