Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural prostitute whose previous films revealed the artistic excess of the sixties and the eighty hollow avarents. With "The Notorious Bettie Page", she points her unshakable gaze to the 1950s, a time covered by the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, as she experienced the beginning of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and his co-writer, Guinevere Turner, are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a movie about the underground icon of an era and how its pure shameless sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and the impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a naked body. If all the details of Bettie's life were concerned about the film, then why would it end before its most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in US attitudes toward current and current sexual imagery. Together with Gretchen Mol's fearless performance and the astoundingly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she accomplishes this goal admirably by raising a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own "enlightened" 21st century attitudes toward - called pornography. As America suffocates under new conservatism, this is a necessary film more than ever.
