What a funny movie is St. Ives. It reminds me of the kind of film made during the 1940s. Classical, rounded story by characters and a plot that is neither dramatically nor overtly complicated. Actually, it's not about anything. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson - here adapted to the screen - looks like Jane Austen to men. We have a tale that has a romance in your heart, but there's a lot of fun too: battle scenes (more or less), prison breakouts, wrong identities, fencing, and the funniest phrase I've heard in years: Scotland would be announced by name at a masquerade ball. " There is a lot of hilarity, difficulties and not a bit of disgust as St. Ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew. <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely stellar with the infrequent very little. seen Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing delight as the ingenious Flora and Miranda Richardson almost walks away with the movie as her wise and mundane, went there and seen all-Auntie Susan. Richard Grant provides comic relief of the highest level. <br /> <br /> This will not be the biggest movie anyone has ever seen, but its charms are undeniable and the whole movie gets irritated with an energy that explodes with life. .
