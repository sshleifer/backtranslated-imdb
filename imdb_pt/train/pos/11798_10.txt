I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's absolutely full of entertainment !!! Boothe powers gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought that an actor could capture "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones. ! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this movie captures its best performance !!!
