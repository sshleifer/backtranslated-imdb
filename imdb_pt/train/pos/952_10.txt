So, did that make the TV movie scores just 7.6 on that site? Bah! Farce Undoubtedly, this 1984 version of Dickens' classic tale is the best of all time. And yes, the Hound saw the 1951 version, which was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest flaw of this version, although the performance was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is simply amazing as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later that night. Scott is just as rude as Scrooge. In fact, it is too rude to some critics who claim that he is unable to project the newfound joy he awakens on Christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never dance on the street in a fit of joy. He has a lot of dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, as are the costumes, the music and the landscape. Century London comes to life in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film is even frightening in several scenes involving the spirits. The important tale of morality shines in every picture, however. <br /> <br /> You will not often find this version broadcast on television, and this is a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be a must-have part of every holiday celebration. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie must enter the DVD at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. The Dog.
