S.S. Van Dine must have been a cunning businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the studio-day film series used to be restricted to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book on Philo Vance, one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and more all released the Philo Vance movies. Only Tarzan seemed to be getting closer to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> MGM has produced the garden murder case and starred in Edmund Lowe as the fashion detective. Of course MGM had the original Philo contract on screen at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing Thin Man at the time and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to focus it there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a very acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started very well at the end of the silent movie era with What Price Glory and then with a series of films with Victor McLaglen with his Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen won his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to disappear into the B movie market. The garden murder case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere surrounding the perpetrator gives, the mystery is really how all the murders are connected and how they are carried out. <br /> <br /> I'll say it. Vance has a very good chance at exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
