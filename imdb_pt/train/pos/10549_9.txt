I just saw this at the Toronto Festival, and I hope it gets released because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven film, and Andrew and David are more than up to the task. Any discussion about the plot can be considered spoilers, so I'll just say that the plot is clever, the acting is superb and the effects are incredible. Well filmed and well paced too. One of the best movies I've seen in a while, and very refreshing this summer of dark movies. The audience laughed all the time. See if you can. (I particularly liked the scene "Candy bar! Candy bar!").
