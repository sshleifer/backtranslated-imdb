Of all the movies of the seventies, none of them captured the truest essence of the battle of good versus evil like the Watchtower. I mean, yes, there were films like the Exorcist and others; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this. If you have time, check this out. You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth entering. So there are all the stars and future stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what is happening as well. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to get all the strange minor statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Also, the books are very good as well. I'm just sorry that they will not turn the second book into a movie. It's so scary it would outweigh this movie.
