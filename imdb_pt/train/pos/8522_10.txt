I found this show really late at night, and I gave it a try. It's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night, if you understand me. Their simplicity of values ​​and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were like children. It's something that I do whenever the meeting (which is rare, maybe I should check the listings! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. Like any good girl movie, you really get emotionally involved with the characters. Good old Louisa May Alcott is still inspiring good stories :) So, apparently, I must complete 10 lines of text for my opinion to be valid, so I think I'll tell you a little more. Children are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are beautiful and full of nature - another thing you do not see much on television. I hope everyone has given it a try. I acknowledge and am fully aware that it is sentimental, but it is a good heart. Like I said before, it's refreshing.
