Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is easily one of the nicest indie movies I've seen in the past year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the screenwriter's debut movie. I mean - I joined IMDb to find more of this writer's films ... because Cross Eyed has that unique signature - you want to see what else this writer might have to say. Nowadays, it is rare to see a well-written, well-directed, well-edited and well-represented film. For me - Cross Eyed encapsulates what moviemaking should be - combining the best of all elements of the film to create a clever, artistic and moving tale. More please.
