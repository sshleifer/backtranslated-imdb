I used to watch this show when I was a kid, and I loved it! I watched when it came in Toonami YEARS ago .... Sheesh, I look so old! I should have been 13 or 14 when it happened ... But anyway, I had a great plot, and I'm one of those girls who watched (and ADORED) Sailor Moon, and I really liked it. The animation was not the best .... Quite amusing in parts, actually, and the dubbing was EXTREMELY limp in the beginning, but it was all a good observation, and I saw myself sucked into it day after day. Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic and one of my all time favorites. Go Ryo !!!!
