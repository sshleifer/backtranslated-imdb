Jon Voight is brilliant at Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, while reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrait of a New York character, only Bill Butcher's portrait of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives to Ratso. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we most tend to identify with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the top 4 or 5 actors in movie history while playing with people around him in such a way that he raises his performances far above their normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's buck is so naive that he would come out of the movie altogether except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, much about surviving, and more importantly, How to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about meeting. I think, as a brave film as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much you're a loser (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you're possession of the secret of life and may even share that perception with another person. <br /> <br /> I can not help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding himself that turns into a movie about escape.
