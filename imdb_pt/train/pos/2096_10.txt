With the advent of IMDb, this neglected movie can now find an interested audience. Because? As users here who search twice for Academy AwardÂ® winner Glenda Jackson, they can find "The Soldier's Return" among their credits. So, can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie. Ann-Margret fans can click on the title as well as those who study the career of the great Alan Bates. Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with the support of heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Any movie with so many notables is rewarded by IMDb, given all the cross-referencing that goes on here. So why is not this movie on DVD? Do Producers not realize that the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a movie? And 'The Soldier's Return' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered. Keep that, people.
