I'm glad it's available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style over the empty head flashes and constant noises. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have little time of attention or lack of intelligence and imagination to engage in literary narrative you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are very simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs did a fantastic job transposing the story of Catherine Storr's Marianne Dreams novel for a screenplay. An unenviable task like anyone who has seen a movie from a book will undoubtedly know. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they give themselves up to the office of acting! I know, I know, actors doing their work and acting instead of resorting to inanimate assaults on the camera lens as a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and firefights explode around them is a genuinely rare treat, but it actually happens This leads me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker and not for the spoon-fed tabloid reader. In addition to a solid script, direction and acting, it is based on the atmosphere, suspense and implicit horror. If it is to be categorized as horror, then the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you like a lot of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts and bright colors you'd be better off watching 'Transformers', but if you like a thriller story that unfolds through a use skillful and evocative narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you nonsense nonsense so this may just be your thing.
