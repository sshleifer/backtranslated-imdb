Well, I was not sure what the movie was going to be like I had seen just a little clip, but I was thinking it would be good and I was right, I watched it twice on the day I got it and well it's my movie favorite. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played the role of beth very well, she is such a thick actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia, although the ending when beth is in the hospital and it has 2 horus observation after meals because iv was told as 1 house is OK and also that hospitals do not help bulimics as iv was said that it is probably because i am still home even tho my sister and mother would like to have me hospitalized like I have bulimia but this is a grill movie I recommend to anyone with or without an eating disorder or to people who know someone with eating disorders as it can leave them for the life of a bulimic person and see the world as they do a little more of all a grill movie and I recommend it to anyone and any kind of person
