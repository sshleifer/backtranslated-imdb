As I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would just be another "B" rate movie, but I was amazed at the acting of the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. The plot was wonderful and unique, as well as with an excellent moral to the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sexual joke, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and courage. This is a wonderfully poignant movie, showing some gloomy realities of life along with the kindness of the human heart and frivolity just enough to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this movie to many "A" rate movies I have even seen a large number with high ticket box office winnings. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
