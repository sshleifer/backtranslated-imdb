I bought the DVD of this version to compare with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and who died this year (2005). I remember a great performance, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and the music on the move. (Music in the 2005 version is much more discreet, but very revealing.) Just to get other commentators on some points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther's boyfriend. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version, nor did he play Toby Esterhase on TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality can make you shiver sometimes, but I dare you not to cry - and laugh!
