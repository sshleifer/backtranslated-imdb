An occasional surreal thriller that will push the buttons of most people, the 4th Man will surely offend someone with a taste for political correctness. The protagonist of the story is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously distorted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers himself <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything wrong with modern man. He is without turns, delirious, unable to control his impulses, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships, and totally apathetic about life in general. As the character himself asserts at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to remember the truth. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ, and then waking up to begin the long march to his own destruction. He chases one man (presumably a boyfriend), and then chases another at a train station. Later, in a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or maybe she has more evil plans. She quickly captures Gerard in his web, luring him with sex and money, taking plenty of both. She also has <br /> secrets like three dead husbands. Is she alone and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow, luring Gerard to her death? Will Garard be the fourth man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does her best to keep him guessing what she is doing. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie with lots of sex and intrigue. It is similar to Verhoeven's <em> basic instinct </ em>, but it has much more depth and is certainly more shocking. There is a lot of very strong gay content, which can make some viewers squirm. Highly recommended for fans of clever psychological thrillers, or for anyone looking for something entirely new.
