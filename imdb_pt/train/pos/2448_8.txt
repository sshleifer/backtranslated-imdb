Yes, it's over, yes, it's a little cliché and yes, Constance Marie is a total baby and worth seeing again and again! Jokes and jokes can get old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Since it is a family program, humor is tempered and writers have incorporated family values ​​and ideals between jokes. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Do not take it seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he did not want his character to be serious or a model of virtue. Their explosions and shouts of joy are hilarious ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that the only big dark point is Benny. I hate the character ... so much that when she stays for more than 30 seconds I change the TV just so I do not have to listen to it. There's nothing funny about your dialogue or your jokes. As a mother she has to be the worst and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, like the character, would stand for such a deplorable person for so long. <br /> <br /> Even so, anytime I get angry. When I see Benny, I think to myself: seeing her is so much better than watching the Bill Engvall Show. Now there is a bad sitcom ...
