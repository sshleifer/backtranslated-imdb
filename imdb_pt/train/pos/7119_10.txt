My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (Major, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical advisor to this film and I hope he has had an impact on the film, making it look like it really was back then, as I read in several comments written by movie viewers . this movie that looked like real life. My father is a fanatic by facts and figures, and always wanted things to be seen as they were, so I'd like to believe he had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically she is Japanese), and a few years ago he was awarded one of the highest commendations of the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and activities to bring Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur banished them after World War II. <br /> <br /> My father was once a Marine, but I know that since you're a Marine, you're always a Marine. And that is exactly what he is and I love and respect him very much. <br /> <br /> I would love to be able to watch this movie if anyone has a copy of it. And I'd love to give my dad his 94th birthday this year!
