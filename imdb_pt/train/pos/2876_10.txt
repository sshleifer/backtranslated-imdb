The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites of Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty, which was also made into a Disney movie in 1959; this movie is a sweet and charming masterpiece from Disney. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great soundtrack; this is one I like in a movie is a very good soundtrack, and I love the songs too; my favorite song is the romantic "So This is Love". I love the movie rats too, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the birds tried to wake Cinderella in the morning; I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (rats and birds) fix Cinderella's biological mother's dress so she could go to the ball ... until Drizella and Anastasia ripped it apart, b *** * is!
