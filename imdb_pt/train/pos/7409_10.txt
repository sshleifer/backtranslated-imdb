Hoping to see a "cute movie" from mainland China, I was ill-prepared. Family dynamics, community, and the inevitability of change have rarely been so thoroughly explored in filmmaking. Each character is solid and I was completely drawn to the story. The organization is much more complex than the American public is accustomed to. However, there is no difficulty in following the progression even while reading captions. Jiang Wu, as retarded brother, is a constant and bright light. Leave your cynicism in your closet. It will be there when you check out.
