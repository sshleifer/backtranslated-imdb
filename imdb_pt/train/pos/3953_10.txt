I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and I never saw it again. For my life, I could not remember the title and simply bumped into it while checking the credits of Roy Thinne's film. Excellent, dark and scary TV horror movie in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the Dark"; and "Satan's School for Girls," all lost satanic classics. I also think there are many parallels with Clint Eastwood's classic "High Plains Drifter". Why do not they release these great movies, especially when you consider all the latest junk that fills Wal-Mart discounted DVD racks? Most of these movies have followers, so sales should not be a problem.
