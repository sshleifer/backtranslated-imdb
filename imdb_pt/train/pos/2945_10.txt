I watched this movie a few times in the 90s and almost broke my sides laughing every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but that's something else. He's so funny. Even the brigade would find that hilarious. You have to watch it, and it's even better if you have the guys or the girls for a drink. The takeoff of Michael Jackson is so similar to him, if you close your eyes, believe that he is singing. The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a deviation of humor if you thought this was not funny. My rental companies no longer sell this video but I would love to put my hands in a copy to show my husband and kids when they are old enough to enjoy the mood. Anyway, highly recommended, I hope you enjoy it.
