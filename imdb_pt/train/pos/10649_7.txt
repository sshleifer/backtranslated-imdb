What can I say about it? It's another Hollywood horror movie on a very high budget ($ 80 million). It's nothing scary, it offers us just a few thrills and a really scary sequence with the skeleton in the fireplace. special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of Hill House is incredible, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! However, I did not like the ending because it was so yummy. Check out this one and form your own opinion on it. I give this photo 7 out of 10.
