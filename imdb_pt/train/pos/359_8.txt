I can not believe I'm just watching this movie - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - just as I still have to see Schindler's List - I do not want to be "entertained" by other people's pain, no matter how authentic or informative it may be. So I guess the main thing I noticed about The Color Purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites. Blacks were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters-or of handing them over to be treated as slaves by their "husbands." It was painful to watch, but everyone was redeemed in the end, and the performance was phenomenal! I could not believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopi to begin with - she was amazing. I'm so glad I was feeling terrible yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running The Color Purple.
