I have noticed that NEW HOPE and EMPIRE IMPEDEM BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this is not even in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation because of the Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> -The Rescue of Han Solo by Jabba: This official ends the sub-plot of Han Solo in debt that was established when we met the character in A NEW HOPE. The Emperor was finally revealed: Well, okay, that may not work as well now that the prequels are out, but this was the first time we saw the Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! The 3-part climate: 1) The Battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts his father & The Emperor's Fall 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (The Lando's Moment) <br /> <br /> -The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie sucks because of the Ewoks but I think it's cool that while the whole galaxy celebrates THE FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our Heroes are having a private party in the woods with each other. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a great ending. chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the story of STAR WARS.
