I recently found this movie on VHS after looking for it for a number of years, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov starred and co-wrote the original screenplay (Oscar nominee). Other stars you've heard include Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / crook, newly released from England's infamous Wormwood Scrubs Prison (he had deviated from the Conservative Party headquarters, chosen for being a liberal). He immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can turn away and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He social engineer his way into a London men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in the city, he steals the identity of a Caesar Smith who has just left the city to South America to pursue his collecting hobby of moths in the wild. He talks about Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computing center, especially his security feature consisting of a blinking blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his security and the computer says to him: "Disconnect the blue light". Using 30-year hacking techniques in the future, Ustinov invades the system and programs the computer to generate written checks for various fictitious companies. The scheme begins to be unraveled when Klemper's assistant, Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart), notices the amount of business that Ta-Can-Co seems to be transacting with Ustinov's hit companies. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid the process and lives happily ever after. To tell you how that would spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent, and anticipated image.
