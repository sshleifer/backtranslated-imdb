The Sea Is Watching was made from an original screenplay by Akira Kurosawa, and is in fact a lush and hot movie. See this will be a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai as director is certainly not the same as the old but eternal master (particularly the mass scenes at the beginning of the movie has some terrible acting), but the overall mood and scenery is very pleasant. Another thing that is lost here: Kurosawa has always been able to let the characters be much more than they are actually showing and doing. <br /> <br /> That was probably his magic on the set while filming; and perhaps this script has not yet been fully approved. <br /> <br /> Maybe we've lost the master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is an adorable and sweet movie, but it is not Kurosawa. Expect it to be pretty silly ...
