Although the movie seems a bit long sometimes, it's worth it. Gordon drives in a style reminiscent of Vonneguts writing styles. Mischievous, thoughtful, ironic, quirky and somber, this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time, begging for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is wonderful too, in a role that will remind us Lynch fans about their Laura / Maddy days. Do not miss this!
