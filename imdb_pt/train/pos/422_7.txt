"The Plainsman" represents Cecil B. DeMille's acting prowess in his most inaccurate and unco-factual. He creates parallel plots for a no less stellar entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, although in reality Lincoln was already dead at the moment the story takes place. From time to time DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but as easily distances himself from the brazen spectacle and the charisma. The film is an attempt to bolster Custer's last position with a lot of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured goods and legends. In fact, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a relic well campy by today's standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately attractive transfer. , with frequently clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There is a considerable amount of film in some scenes and an absence at other times. All in all, the picture quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but is it never all bad or all good? just slightly better than the middle of the road. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies are not distracting. The audio is mono, but well balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. It's universal! BACKGROUND: Like the pseudo-history painted in celluloid, this western is attractive and fun. Just take your characters and story with a grain of salt ?? in some cases ?? a whole box seems more appropriate!
