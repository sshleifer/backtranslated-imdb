I always wondered what happened to that kind of magical feeling that the old Slovenian films seemed to have in them ... Well, over time I wondered if that feeling was just nostalgia. Or did that "feeling" decide to pack up and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our movie history, and then never come back? Or did you? Because for me, it came back the first time I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it was your old self again. <br /> <br /> There are three qualities of this film that make it so unique and as fun as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of colors and, what I most enjoyed - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something many other Slovenian writers (not just) should at least consider). There is no use for words when you can understand each other as well (yes, or better) by other means in use. Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, that's why I recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to all of you as a must-see movie from Slovenia, regardless of what you might hear about Slovene. movies (if you've heard anything, that's ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and that scene where Bakovic is dancing with Vivaldi's music ... A pleasure. <br /> <br/> Treat yourself. Watch.
