This film is worth being seen alone for John Lennon's excellent portrait of Jared Harris. It does not matter that Harris does not look exactly like Lennon; his mannerisms, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best Scene: Lennon at a local caf√©, verbally fighting with a stuttering fan, about whether Paul McCartney & Wings' "Silly Love Songs" is worthy of # 1 status in America.
