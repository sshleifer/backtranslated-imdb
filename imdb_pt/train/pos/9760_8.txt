I have fond memories of this movie, as I saw it with my two younger sisters, when it was first shown in theaters in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently, it was considered a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (the cassette tape and scan - which has never done justice to the image or its ambitious Panavision compositions are out of print). The film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW). SUBMARINE) and admittedly irregular. Some of the characters and sequences are excellent, while others are somewhat juvenile and indistinguishable. The sad blue discarded camel (Eeyore tones) and its blue music are truly comforting. Joe Raposo's songs are, for the most part, simply beautiful. Definitely a curiosity that will probably (sadly) fall into total obscurity.
