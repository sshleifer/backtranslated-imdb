Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a cute movie, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops very quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, in a minute he's ready to hit his ass, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, the film's editing and the script (even if the photograph was great, the scenery was good and the costumes were cool too) could have been a little better. It seems that the production was very rushed. The supporting cast was also good, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter, Rosie. She at 11 years old looks really cute and it's a shame she has not become a teenage actress. She is much better in this film than in her previous films like Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (with the exception of Broadway Musketeers 1938, she is very good at it) when they tried to make it into a hybrid Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason. Overall, this movie could improve, but in the end, Judy gave it all.
