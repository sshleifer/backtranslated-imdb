It was at 7:30 in the morning, very close to the school to see very often. The animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea of ​​cowboys and ordinary people casually playing around in space vehicles and robots was incredible. Maybe inspired the Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's very annoying in the DVD format. The shows are basically identical. When viewing non-sequential episodes on a DVD, you are stoned by Disc # 3. By today's standards, the animation is erratic. We no longer notice the computer graphics and focus on how fussy the characters are. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the heroine characters. They were far more believable, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and were not corny. They really saved men.
