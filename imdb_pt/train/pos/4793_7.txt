After seeing this movie, I feel like I know a little more about the US. David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and strange because of the strangeness, and in fact these elements are not missing in The Straight Story. However, it is a light that I have not witnessed from Lynch before. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but we end up with a series of absurdly interesting characters, with depth in their lives that can not be apparent since its introduction. Especially in motion was the bar scene with two World War II veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how this still affected their lives and current emotions. If you're looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is the movie for you.
