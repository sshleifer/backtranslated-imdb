I was fortunate enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have seen it for the second time. The first time was on late night TV in Australia for over 20 years but I could never forget this strange and somber movie .. Not many people like this movie at all because it is so unconventional The fact that there is almost no dialogue spoken of in this movement - we just hear the thoughts of the characters - is just an unconventional aspect of it. Looking for a copy of this film I discovered that the producer was dead, the main actor died, was not kept in any British TV or movie file, which was never released on video or DVD, which the Television networks around the world destroyed it after their copyright ran out in the 1980s. When it was first shown on TV in Australia, there were no writable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> The second time, recently, I could see why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, much like a stage by Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if anyone wants a DVD copy, please e-mail me and I'm sure we can do something.
