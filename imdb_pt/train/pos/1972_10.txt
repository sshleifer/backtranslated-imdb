I do not understand your objections to this movie. It's an exciting extension of the character created in "Wild Instinct". The only part of the story that is a bit unrealistic, is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not stuck at the last minute. SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we're presented with three theories of what's going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) The corrupt cop of David Thewlis is killing these people to frame the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. What bothers most people about the film seems to be that none of these theories is explained as the "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility to kill the policeman, the only murder that occurs on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of "2001, A The Odyssey in Space ". "Who really cares about what's real?" The blonde really is crazy, the cop is really crooked and the analyst really wants revenge, the important thing is the interaction between these and other characters in the story. complicated than no one thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. Leave it behind!
