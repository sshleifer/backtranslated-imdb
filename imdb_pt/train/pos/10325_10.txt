I grew up in Doc Savage and was petrified of green death as a child, but even so, as now, I found it quite amusing. I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this movie and have had so much fun with the diversity of reactions. , they usually think I'm weird, but there you are. "I do not know what it is about Doc, but he always catches the girls" has to be the final line when you look at your sad group of men. This movie is a classic parody in all the superhero genre, and it was long before the time came, not to be taken seriously, move on Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. It is unfortunate that this film has not been released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it should be redone and bastard, as I said it's a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like Italian work without the Mini and Michael Caine). I give 10/10.
