An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first one ended, with a lot of mystery. Thriller in most if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and unite all the characters and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so significant. Never cease to excite and I look forward to the new season. Let's hope more secrets are revealed and at the same time more mystery to be solved. Good cast selection also for this show, they fit perfectly the characters. I really can not wait to finally figure out the secret. I hope all the hype will not spoil the end.
