When scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts the invitation to work at Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves in with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and her son Robbie (Barret Oliver ) and daughter Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) to a huge modern home in the corporate complex. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt by telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional rise in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. Later, he is introduced to club director Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who befriends Patricia and persuades her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the change in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about Jessica and the members. In the '80s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell," I liked this movie that partially resembles "The Stepford Wives," with people changing behavior in a suburban complex. I just saw this today and found a big metaphorical message against big corporations when people literally sell their souls to the devil to rise up and earn higher wages. I'm not sure if the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but I believe that it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Invitation to Hell" ("Invitation to Hell")
