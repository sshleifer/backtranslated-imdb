William H. Macy is more understanding and attractive as a successful and loving father who wants to get out of the family business without irritating his authoritarian parents. It passes through much of the same territory as TV's "The Sopranos" in terms of the middle-age crisis of a criminal theme (here he also visits a psychiatrist), but it is still worth watching thanks to Brommel's tense direction with anticipation what this guy drives next), an excellent script, and all great performance. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is in his chilling better than the dominating father. Tracy Ullman gives a dramatic turnaround surprisingly attractive as Macy's wife. The young David Dorfman is excellent as the intelligent and sensitive son of Macy (many of his lines sound improvised and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (which I generally find abominable) is convincing as the troubled young woman who catches Macy's eyes. All of this is punctuated by a moving and fast-paced score that leads to a predictable but nevertheless powerful climax and with significant and exciting consequences. This film deserved a much wider release, as I suspect it would have connected with the public.
