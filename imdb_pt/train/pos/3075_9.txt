A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like part of a neurotic sexual object, but does not have the chops to work with him at the level the script asked for. But he is such a good actor that he played to her level to make the scenes work. I very much applaud the cast of Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife. Who knows? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character look taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy's portrait of the only situation where her character is not able to be careful is nothing less than a complete mastery.
