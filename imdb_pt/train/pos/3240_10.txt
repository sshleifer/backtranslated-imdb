I found this movie by mistake many years ago and wondered then (yet) why it did not get the acclaim it should have. Well written, beautiful acting, an ironic twist after another, and there is clarity in what the nefarious characters are trying. I would not recommend this movie to people with little attention; requires intelligence enough to understand that there may be a core of truth in this story.
