10 out of 10, this brilliant and super documentary is a must-see, with movie clips from the war that people have not seen for years, until this movie was shown in 1974. The clips in this documentary of the war do not lack anything, some of the clips me they left stupefied. The entire series has more than 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning war story. Simply this is still probably the best war documentary yet, and now over 25 years of age is still able to pack a tremendous punch. You should watch this at some point, even if it's a few episodes, even though you're still impressed by the impact that this documentary has on those who have suffered there and died on behalf of WAR in a WORLD AT WAR ..
