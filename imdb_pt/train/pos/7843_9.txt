I can not believe they took it off the air. Especially when they only had a few more episodes. My daughter, sister and some of my friends loved watching this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so-called evaluations. It's not fair to the people who were watching this show from the start. We had the right to see the end. I would like them to have a general vote of all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They could send jobs by mail and we, as spectators, could give a general vote on all the programs we have seen or heard. This can also help promote a new program. People would see and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what viewers are watching, you can also use this as a free tool for TV ads and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back!!
