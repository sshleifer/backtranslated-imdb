Those involved in the film camera so early in the century must have discovered a little of its potential from the outset. This is a good story of a type of playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his double and he must face it frequently, ripping his life apart. There are wonderful scenes with people disappearing and of course the scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general lack of attractiveness of the people in the movie. Moreover, they practically shied away from a lot of action that would have at least given some life to the thing. I was informed of this movie about 25 years ago and I finally got to see it. I was not dissapointed.
