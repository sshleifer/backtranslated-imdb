I accidentally borrowed this film from a friend without knowing anything about it, and it turned out to be an excellent documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that ancient Peruvian Incas managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia based on certain relics found in both places, certain types of ancient ships that we knew they had available, chain analysis oceanic and windy, and the knowledge that the Incas actually traveled in some undetermined quantity at sea. To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build a ship as close as possible to what the ancient Incas had available, using only raft wood and other materials available at the time, and left Lima, capital of Peru, to try to reach the islands of Polynesia, about 8,000 kilometers away. <br /> </ p> <p> His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of his journey provides strong support for him to be right. The film is really little more than the narration of filming made during the expedition of more than 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of how it was and the trials and tribulations they faced. I often wish that Oscar-winning documentaries were easier to find, and this more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I'm sure it was when it was released.
