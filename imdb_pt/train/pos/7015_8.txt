Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who pretty much gives the store to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us all hear the line by an IRS agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then spreads into a laugh that says, "Yes, right." <br /> <br /> As you go further and further into this story, you can not discover this face. It is easy for those being audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? It helps a lot, we want him to be our auditor, if we are audited, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (joking, joking) <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the movie is perfect and so much that the clues were ignored, which would have told me what was really going on. Intense, repeat intensely, the focus was on Ben and stay there. The whole movie only works because of Ben while we try to figure it out and I did not see any clue (what clues are you talking about, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the movie on DVD was the best way to go here. At the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well, it was obvious by then. And, yes, it's exaggerated, but it's still a great story, mostly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for Best Actor. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is exaggerated, and despite the great acting, when you finally get all the answers, you should realize that the movie message is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you will not need many clues to find out. I did not do. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to get excited about. Brando. Nudity: No. Language:
