David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, very good) is a lawyer, more skilled in dealing with corporate taxation (and suffers from unusual dreams that bother him to see this Aboriginal man shrouded in darkness), who is called to take a case on a group of Aborigines accused of the murder of one of them named Billy ... we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting and is killed when a leader of an Indian tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "death bone" for stop your heart. Meanwhile, spinning around David, bizarre weather patterns affect Sydney, such as rain pounding on polluted land and rock-sized hail over bright blue skies (without visions of clouds, like one striking a school in central Australia), not to mention , a "deformed" rainbow that is divided (!) into groups. As David pursues the case, he discovers that he is much closer to the strange events that unfold than he could imagine. An Aboriginal named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and discovers that this man is one of what he should represent at the trial! He thinks it is quite possible, after some strange encounters with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he may well be attached to a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are real premonitions of possible horrors that are yet to come. <br /> <br /> The absorbing apocalyptic drama builds its history methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir in charge, the film is visually impressive when we see these stunning images of a possible doom for civilization, but the most convincing angle of the film is certainly David's journey to find that monumental truth that haunts him while questioning Charlie and Chris countless At first to help his men get out of a crime they did not commit and finally find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or may occur later.
