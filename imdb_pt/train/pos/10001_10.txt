Brilliant over-performance by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and love scenes in the clothing store are second to none. Corn on the cheek is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. Opinion on lawyers is also excellent. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling his boss, and being dishonest, Pepto Bolt's lawyer shrug indifferently, "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of the late Larry Sanders, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. Your character is more evil than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics. Look for the scene of the legs and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie improves every time I see it (which is quite frequent).
