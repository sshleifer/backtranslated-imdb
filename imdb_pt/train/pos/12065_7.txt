"Insignificance" is far from being a great movie, a play, directed by Nic Roeg. In Roeg's film scheme, this is above the level of most of her "Do not Look Now" work, which is characterized by Theresa Russell's judicious use as a leading actress. She is really very good here, and far from the problem in other Roeg movies like "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As the "actress," who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying her as a completely depressing but pleasant mermaid. She plays well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein, who is great to say the least. He looks the part admirably, and while Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she certainly is attractive enough to make the play look true. Other players are adequate if not as impressive as Emil and Russell. A well-crafted and clever script is well-directed by Roeg, but certainly not brilliantly, like "Walkabout" or "Performance." As in other later Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague and insubstantial flashbacks, which add too little to the film. In many ways, the film would have worked better as a shorter piece (say, 60 minutes), more modest. Still, an acceptable and acceptable film. Sometimes quite excellent, but a bit lacking overall. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
