Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the driving force that other actresses should keep in mind. She has the audacity to put herself in a role of tough girl rarely seen early in her career (and do it), which is a feat that must be recognized. Although his later films put him to the same role, this film was made for his sturdiness. <br /> <br /> Your character is a student / fighter / romanticized lover, struggling to overcome his disenchanted existence in the projects, which is a bit exaggerated in the movie ... but not for a girl. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story is deepened when the heated relationships with which this girl has to cope boil and her primitive rage takes over. <br /> <br /> I saw an actress taking such an aggressive position in the movies, and I'm glad she was giving that original Hollywood touch. This movie received a 7 from me because of the average story of the ghetto young people, but has such a great actress portraying a role rarely seen in a minimal budget film. Great job.
