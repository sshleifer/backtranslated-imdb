UC 0079, the One Year War is almost over. A neutral colony of Side 6 was targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon task force. Its target, a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray of the original Gundam saga) inside. When boy Al Izuruha, Zeon MS fan, encounters a Zaku after the battle erupts in the colony, he befriends rookie MS Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Throughout the show, Bernie acts as a paternal figure for Al (whose true father is always working) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they must meet ... in battle. Al soon discovers that war is not child's play and Bernie must choose to make the final sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a show well done. The moving costumes are extremely well designed, and the animation may look dated, but it really shows emotion in the characters. If you liked 0083, then take a look at this, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look for a show for the development of drama and character, this is the one for you, it focuses more on this battle of mobile suit. I would rate more drama than action. <br /> <br /> Gundam Mobile Suit 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
