When I first read the plot of this drama I assumed it was going to be like Sex and the City, however, this drama is nothing like that. The stories the characters seem more real and you empathize with the most situations. The concept of drama is similar, four women in their thirties guide us through friendships and relationships with problems and conflicts along the way. Katie the GP is a dark and melancholy character that you also find difficult to relate to and is the best friend of Trudi, a widow. Trudi's character is heart warming, as you can relate to the difficulties she's having along with being the only mother of the four. Jessica is the very single party girl and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a nice character and is closer to Siobhan, the newlywed who, despite loving her husband, can not stop her eyes from going to her co-worker. Over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continue to produce the series, it could do well. It's different from other female dramas like Sex and the City, or Desperate Housewives. That if thrown right could be the next cold foot. Also, the male cast is not bad for the eyes either.
