I loved this movie. Not only because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he's in pretty much every German film that counts. But also because he is not the main actor. The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to watch Julietta from 2001, and who really carries this film on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> A family moves from Italy to Germany in search of the "German dream". (this is my own invention and ironic ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industries. However, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey that the film takes to that point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point on, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a filmmaker is threatened by his rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can be shaped by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie does not say which life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It merely gives us a rewarding glimpse of what identity searching should look like when two countries and mindsets are involved. and this look is not moved by the bitterness or contempt of either country, which makes it such a good movie for any and every country that deals with the tensions resulting from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved from Turkey to Germany in the 1970s also lends this film a great measure of his emotional credibility and accuracy. The icing on the cake are fantastic performances from the entire cast, especially Metschurat and - this I really need to emphasize - the little boy who plays the young Gigi. This kid's performance would be a difficult act to be followed by just about anyone! Great movie, go see.
