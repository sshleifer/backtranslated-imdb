I admit to creating great expectations before watching because some friends have mentioned (and they are not perverted!) As you should see. And you must see! Just do not expect to see anything pioneering. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there is a lot of perversion and it does not stay in the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are Kieslowski's reviews of Blue, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock and maybe a few more that I've lost (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I usually do not miss things unless they are very obvious or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> In addition to being repetitive, which makes it very long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of perceiving some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most of the thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory. <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of Mr. Zizek's narration and effort to revive Freud's theory, which was numbed for a long time, especially in North America. Again, it is way above expectations, and I believe it is not a waste of time, as I believe that most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
