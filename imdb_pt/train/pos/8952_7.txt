Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she is drawn to her rather ordinary neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She cast a spell on Shep that forces him to abandon his fiancé and fall in love with her. Things are going really well until Gillian finds out she really cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when she finds out she was "cheated" of falling in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As for the cheerful comedies of the 1950s, the Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It is a nice enough watch and should please almost everyone who sits with it. Just do not go to the movies expecting the best thing since the sliced ​​bread. The film is cute, funny and sometimes touching in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have a real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in a discreet way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often funny and steals many of Novak and Stewart's spotlights. The biggest problem I see is that the Bell Book and Candle can not decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a crazy comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quine had just one approach, the film could have been even better and more memorable.
