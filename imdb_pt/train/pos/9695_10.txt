Some people may call "Paulie" a children's movie, but I want to state that it is more than that. Probably more than anything else, this movie will successfully showcase the situation of immigrants in the United States - topics given to recent debates. Portraying a parrot telling a Russian immigrant janitor (Tony Shalhoub) of how he searched in America for its original owners, the film tells several stories. There is the elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom he becomes a friend, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very well done movie. I usually do not expect much of this kind of movies, but this is a treat. I would certainly recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
