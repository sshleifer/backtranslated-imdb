The idea was a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, fun and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film I have seen. I rated this movie with the highest rating possible. I also recommend that it be shown to office managers and business people at any facility. What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never heard, their voice is never heard. It's a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to move on. I hope the one produced produces a second part for this 'idea'. I look forward to seeing the sequel. Once again, Halaqah media welcomes in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
