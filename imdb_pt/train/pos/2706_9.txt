I saw this movie at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the director of the film. I heard Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought he would be his masterpiece-his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (as Mr. Wood did) it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And that's cool. The big joke of "I woke up early the day I died" is that it does not even try to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> That makes the movie very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely excellent. You see, this is high art ... or low junk. ****
