I'm sorry for the people who go to the movies with a block and pencil to write down the flaws and keep notes about how bad a movie is. I also feel contempt for people who go to the movies and CAN NOT suspend reality and / or let them enjoy 90 minutes of their boring or busy lives! Get a GRIP staff. The ECGTB is a very ENTERTAINMENT movie. If you take movies seriously, this is not for you. If you're hoping the movie looks like the book anyway, that's not for you. But if you liked the total hilarity of the Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or the "what the hell I'm watching" from the Moulin Rouge. Or the coarse comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" So, let yourself escape to Cowgirls. It has some really funny parts. Hilarious, actually. It also has good music, kudos to kd.lang. Also I mentioned that you have 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... need I say more?
