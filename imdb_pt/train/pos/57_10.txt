I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and looked through the tv and found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 mins, but I got hooked. It was so interesting and exciting. This shows what can happen in anyone's life. I give a 10, more if possible. The director / writer and actors did an incredible job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like that. I loved! I did not even know about this movie, which is sad because it was very good. I wish it was in the movies for more people to see.
