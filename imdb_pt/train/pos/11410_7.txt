EDMUND LOWE (which reminds me a little of Warren William) heads the beautiful cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a fast pace and only lasts a little over an hour. Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who seems to have the intention of his own death (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of supporting cast - all of Bruce Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, there is Nat Pendleton as an idiot detective - and in addition, get a load of art deco decor for the fancy interior of a rich home. It must have been a set that has been used in many subsequent movies. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too confused. It's all clear to detective Philo Vance - and then he has a final confrontation with the killer who gives the film a great five minutes of pure suspense. <br /> <br /> Well done and pass the time in a fun way. .
