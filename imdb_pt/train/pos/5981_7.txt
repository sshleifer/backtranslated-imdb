TRICK OR TREAT is a good example of Hollywood jumping on the bandwagon "backwards messages in metal music" that Tipper Gore and his Washington Wives kicked off in the mid-80s (other less successful entries in this mini-genre include the terrible BLACK ROSES and silly the gate). I was in the second year of school when TRICK OR TREAT came out and could not wait to see. It seemed to have disappeared from video stores in the late 1980s, but I finally got a copy of the affordable DVD a short time ago and brought back many nice metal memories of the past. Any metal nerd teenager can relate to Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer's (Marc Price's "Family Ties") essays in this film while he is chased by the beautiful people at his school for his heavy metal fashion and musical tastes. . Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks a lot like Motley Crue's Tommy Lee), who is killed in a hotel fire at the beginning of the movie. Eddie is heartbroken until he gets a test by pressing Sammi's latest unreleased radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss soon). Eddie soon discovers that this LP, when thrown back, allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Soon Sammi is giving Eddie advice on how to approach his preppie torturers, but when the messages escalate into scariness ("Waste'em ALL ... no fake metal!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, which results in Sammi returning to life via Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi welcomes the great dance at Eddie High School and climbs onto the stage to shake up the crowd and disintegrate some "false metalworkers" before Eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not terribly scary in 2006, it was not scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metalist and has a courtesy soundtrack. cult track Fastway. It's worth looking for if you've already hit your head or have a taste for B-grade horror movies (or both, like me).
