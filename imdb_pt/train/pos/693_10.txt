This is a movie with almost no action following Jack, an insomniac, while he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself outside a building and, for the most part, can not distinguish the reality of hallucination. Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is truly believable. Confused and frightened, but lethargic and sometimes imbued with what he sees, we follow him trying to find out what he is seeing and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have something interesting, incomprehensible, 43 minutes. And the shower scene is enough to make any fan of the sun come back for more.
