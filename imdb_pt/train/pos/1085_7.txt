This film was a rather entertaining comedy about Murphy's Law applied to property and home construction. If a movie like this was being done today, the family would undoubtedly be dysfunctional. Since being raised in the forty 'simplest', we have achieved what is supposed to be a typical family of the time. Grant, of course, perfectly combines the comic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent support cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas. His pranks make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
