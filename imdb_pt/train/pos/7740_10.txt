It's rare to find a movie as perfect as that. It's truly one of the best-played and best-structured films I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, relating to each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that trap you and refuse to let go. Add to that the slow burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as poignant as anything that's ever been compromised with celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. It exposes the romance of films like "Titanic" as the trivial cliches that they are. If you're looking for a movie to watch while you fold clothes, that's not it. You have to commit to this movie. You can not have a conversation as you enter and leave the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat him with the respect you deserve and you will have plenty of it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the greatest movie of all time.
