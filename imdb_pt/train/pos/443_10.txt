I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's when it was first released. Room with view was also recently. April Enchanted had so much more to offer! I found it much more real and terrain, the characters more believable for being 'normal'. At the end of the film I felt the same as when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for, whether isolation, peace, freedom or love. You realize that Italy is so far from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent to take risks and leave behind everything that is monotonous and constricting. But in the heat of the spring of April, everyone's lives loosen and unfold (according to the Victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilt to the satisfaction of all. What a little movie gem! Why is this no longer known?
