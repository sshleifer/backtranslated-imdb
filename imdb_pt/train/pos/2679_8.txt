A piece of delirious humor, almost without a plot, and if it is more LSD-inspired than the Devil, then we must remember when it was made! After a surprising SM opening (which even is not what it seems) we move to soft focus and dream or imagine or remember? Many literary and cinematographic references and, in fact, this is the Franco film that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and mesmerizing, the film unfolds at a leisurely pace, but has a wealth within each fold. A rare movie languishing inside. Old Jess could do them when he tried. Beautiful central performances also including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I did not even mention the places in Lisbon - ah!
