Here is another beauty following beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of troubled lovers (an Israeli, a Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of ethnic conflicts, but also from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a revealing moment when one of the overtly gay side characters is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of uneasy discomfort. wash the room. Clearly, the boy is not as open as he looks, and the family does not accept as much as he would like while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A good deal of complexity is accumulated in a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi and Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently bringing together emotional and psychological complexity in brief sequences. The film is also effective for the odd way it portrays the mutual brutality that Israelis and Palestinians inflict on one another. If you're not heartless, you'll cry in the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so cleverly written and acted that it reminds us of how good a melodrama can be satisfactory.
