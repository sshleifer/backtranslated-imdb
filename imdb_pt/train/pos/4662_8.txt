I just saw the Hot Millions at TCM and completely forgot about this gem. Ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that cleverly leaves you from a hunter of two to ingenious ... Well, you'll see. Maggie Smith is perfect as the clumsy secretary / neighbor who has difficulty keeping a job, but has a warm and vibrant personality that transpires in this image. It creates a good portrait of a warm, witty, and real person who, in the long run ... well ... Molden and Newhart, while key executives take on the challenge of doing what they could be banal roles and get them out into a comic life of their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know that at least in the case of Romero Ustinov is extending a helping hand from work. <br /> <br /> This movie is to be a shot in the computer age and is a problem for the common con man, but in fact the characters are so engaging and very fun to watch the computer sub-plot is almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Awaken your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and the friendly, forgiving and deeply engaging storyline in this photo.
