I rented this a few years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straightforward video was hitting your stride (you know, where the box covers use the same source and color schemes for the hit movies). I did not know what to expect other than what was printed. The first thing I thought while watching was "what the hell are wrong with the sound?" "Obviously, there was no dialogue dubbing. The words echoed, so I stopped chewing on whatever I had to pay more attention to - note that there is no Shakespeare here! Just a simple conversation. The story is simple enough, boy knows girl etc. What struck me as funny and heartfelt was that the people in the movie did not look like caricatures written in history, but rather actors temporarily ripped out of their actual jobs (including uniforms). All the time, you start to feel what the filmmaker is looking for, and then you see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people hurting their intimate parts, using vulgarities that could not have hurt marketing.) There was something honest about it. they had a bigger budget, so it would have been better, which I'm sure they considered daily, but, they went ahead and got it. "That, I felt, was what independent movie production has to do. is thrown around like it's a genre .. Ha! .. this is funny!
