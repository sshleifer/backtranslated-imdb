Normally I do not really like Emma Roberts, but after seeing Nancy Drew, I kind of changed my mind. The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. Most of the time, when you watch a mysterious movie, you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you're actually there. The clues should fit in until you can finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed how she found out. The whole movie was very clever and the people who watched with me also loved the movie. Clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I do not think there will be another movie like this until the sequel leaves. I give nine, because popular girls do not really seem to play the right role, but they still make me laugh. It was a great movie and a great mystery. I would definitely recommend watching it.
