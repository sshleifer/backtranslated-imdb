While the story is essentially routine, and the ending of the "surprise" is nothing more than a bad joke to the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it gives them the kind of roles good actors can shine and shine they do. The film is impeccably done - for your time. It was remade in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you want to see only one version of the story (that's all it deserves, actually), I recommend the second, with Hopkins' updated direction and most explicit references to points plot that the original might just suggest. The end, however, still blows. (** 1/2)
