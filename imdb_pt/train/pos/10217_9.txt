The beating of butterfly wings in the Atlantic could trigger a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to Chaos Theory, I do not know exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will initiate a chain reaction that can lead to major events. This little gem of a movie shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect their lives. (The theory of the six degrees of separation can also be applied.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this movie. The performance is finely tuned and differentiated (Audrey Tautou is luminous), the stories fit plausibly, the mood is fair, and the viewer leaves the theater swinging accordingly.
