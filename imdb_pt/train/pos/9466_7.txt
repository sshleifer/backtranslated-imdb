Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own column of advice that will likely be distributed. After the death of his wife, he had time to raise his daughters. Having known no romance for some time, nothing prepares him for the meeting with Radiant Marie at a local bookstore in a small Rhode Island ocean town to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his large family. After liking Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the beautiful woman appears in the family complex. After all, it's the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> It's clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are meant for each other, and even though we feel what the outcome will be, we're going on the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Hedges, an author and screenwriter on his own, gave us two excellent novels, "What's Eating Gilber Grapes," and "An Ocean in Iowa," and the delightful indie, "Pieces of April," which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both films deal with families during Thanksgiving meetings. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. continues to improve all the time. In many ways he reminds us of Jack Lemmon in his comedy and serious material. What can be said about Mrs. Binoche, a clever actress, and a brilliant presence in any movie. she's right in doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie. <br /> <br /> The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture: John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, has nothing to do, serve only as incidental music for decoration, Dane Cook, which is seen Brother Mitch does better because he can recite more lines than the others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a delightful movie that will appeal to everyone.
