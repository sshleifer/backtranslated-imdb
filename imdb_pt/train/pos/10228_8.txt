Being a giant monster fan, I sell "Yeti" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good old illegal market, I was able to find a copy easily, and I was happy to see that the film was, in fact, dare to say, decent. <br /> <br /> Decent for what is, in fact, a giant monster movie. It comes into action quickly, as the Yeti is found almost immediately, and we are introduced to various characters. They consist of a few keypads, some good ones, and a girl who is practically one of the most incredibly beautiful girls in any science fiction movie, by far. <br /> <br /> The Yeti looks like a long He left the original Woodstock show and in fact, it's not that bad, especially after being introduced to the world in some sort of cage-like thing. Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he does not even get angry (in fact he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but kind of seems perplexed in trying to figure things out. The Yeti seems to understand English very well (my copy was dubbed in English) and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti do his things, and he practically throughout the film, and in typical low-budget fashion, he seems to change greatly in size depending on the scene and there is even one lots of photos of his "false legs" standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, special effects are not the best, but there are definitely some good ones here. One scene in which the Yeti crosses a warehouse is very well done, and in another it uses the windows of a building as "stair steps" to descend from the top - breaking every window with the foot and often hitting the occupants - in a sequel that really looks much, much better than it should in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never lowers as low as, "APE" does. In fact, the only time she gets close to genuine nonsense is when the pretty girl makes the Yeti's nipple stand upright and raises her eyebrow in a "oh yeah baby" way. But even this is not so bad, and even laughed at the viewer. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but, surprisingly, it's not boring - the story is really good, and just seeing this absolutely gorgeous actress on the screen will make any male viewer happy. "Yeti" may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster movies, but it's definitely better than other thefts of King Kong '76 like "APE" and "Queen Kong" from far away.
