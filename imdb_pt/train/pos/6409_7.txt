I had not heard of Brashear before watching this. This is the story of him and the man who trained him, helping him to become the first African-American diver in the US Navy. A tale of willpower. The plot is well written and develops very well. This is what it seems, the weakest thing of the underdog, and does not bring many surprises. It's also quite Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the real man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. However, it does the job, with dramatic scenes and hardships along the way, and this is inspiring for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can not" be told about your lifelong dream. Performance performances are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. shine when they're on the screen. Rapaport is wonderful too. The characters are well written, reliable and consistent. This is well edited and features good cinematography. The production values ​​are high and this does a pretty compelling job of transporting us back to the 1950s. This is the only film I've seen by this director and the writer, although I can now consider investigating more for them. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. I recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting, and / or fans of those who did. 7/10
