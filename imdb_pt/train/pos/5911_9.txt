Remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was an animator at Terrytoons, then at Paramount Cartoon Studios, after that, he was the director of Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, this is Coonskin. And it really is very good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (No, duh, it was a working title) but with a twist that becomes a flash of a Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> <br /> It is about Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacher (Charles Gordone) rushing to help his friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by an obstacle and end up in a firefight with the police. While waiting for them, Randy scandalously listens to his fellow fugitive Pappy (Scatman Crothers), when he begins to tell Randy a story about "three guys, I used to know, just like you and your friends." Pappy's story is told in animation with photos and live action background images. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (White voice) and Preacher Fox (voice of Gordone) decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells to a man who turns him into a brothel. Arriving in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox discover that it is not all it seems to be. They find a con man named Simple Savior, a false revolutionary leader who claims to be the "cousin" of Black Jesus, and that he gives his followers "the strength to kill the whites." In a flashy stage performance in his "church," Salvador acts brutalized by symbols of black oppression - represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for "donations." <br /> <The first rabbit goes against Madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white cop and the mafia man, who shows his disdain for African Americans in a variety of ways, including refusing to bathe before an early encounter with them . believe they are not worth it). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit is receiving his payments, he and his teammates, Ruby and Bobby, are taken to a nightclub called "The Cottontail". A black stripper distracts you as an LSD sugar cube is dropped into your drink. Madigan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual connection with a stereotypically effeminate homosexual man, and then pushed into the clothing that the women were representative of the racist archetype, adorned in something racist and finally pushed out of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> So, as he recovers from his delusion of being drugged, he shoots his gun randomly and is shot dead by the police after firing on one of the Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opposing pugilist running out of the arena of boxing as they explode. The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping while being shot by several white cops, but surviving. <br /> <br /> This movie was controversial at the time of the release, and was rescued. edited by the director several times under the title, Street Fight, which is obvious, since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary on street racism. In fact, this movie has the same theme as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This caused Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this film and the original Tobe Hopper classic, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to leave the market. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but due to racism, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. The animation was incredible at that time, the plot made sense, and it's really funny too. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: 9/10
