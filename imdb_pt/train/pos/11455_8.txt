This German documentary, in English, is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art of objects that he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film, we see him picking up pieces of ice pendants and "gluing" them with a little moisture in a serpentine form that seems to pass repeatedly through a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, snowflakes melt, but this transience is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a website and realizes this, deciding intuitively what to do on that day. He speaks of having a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials with which he works, trying to work * with * instead of against them. It could be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. The sculpture can last for minutes or years, or it may not last long enough to be completed and photographed. Work seems to be more of a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> The film and the work are beautiful, inspiring and thought-provoking. It moves very slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night's sleep. But go if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> Search the web for a few pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find out what this movie means to you in a completely independent way. I remember some ideas that occurred to me while watching the movie, which I thought I would share with those who are still reading. First, the transient nature of much of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live and finally we die. This is natural, and this is also naturally part of the art of Goldsworthy. The other thought was to be impressed by the way Goldsworthy was able to integrate his passion and his work so completely into his life. Most of us have a job that is at best tolerated, a life we ​​hardly notice living, and passions with which we really want to spend more time, if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all these aspects of his life that seems to work very well and is nourishing to him and to those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Seen on 8/28/2002.
