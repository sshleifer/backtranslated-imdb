In his time, this film had polemic throughout (like most of the projects of Verhoeven). <br /> <br /> Containing very graphic representations of scenes of death; A parachute that does not open the guy's body on the ground. A guy being eaten by a lion * chomp * teeth in the throat. And a guy getting hit by a motorboat * zoom * bloody corpse coming down. <br /> <br /> But in addition to blood, this film also contains some brilliant (and incredibly beautiful) scenes filmed in the gray fishing town of Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a can of milk, surrounded by pieces of blood-soaked meat and a smoking love scene between two male characters in a graveyard. <br /> <br /> The story is completed in a frenetic, but fulfilling 10 minutes that does not disappoint, and will leave you sighing a sigh of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course with pros come the cons, some special effects are very exaggerated, and obviously are made to see how far Verhoeven could push the gore factor (eg the various eyes hanging from their orbits). In addition, while the two protagonists (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) do an excellent job of bringing their characters to life, the character Herman (played by Thom Hoffman) seems extremely underdeveloped, making it difficult to care for, even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I did my best to give you a small idea of ​​what to expect from this incredible movie, and as you can see, it's not easy to sum it up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
