this is an honest attempt to make a lovely and sweet love story. the obvious inspiration behind the hit TV series "Bewitched," this adorable rom-com is a timeless treasure. the comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays an awkward but impassive "hetero". Kim Novac plays a voluptuous blonde witch who captures her through the use of a love spell. but when this spell is broken by a stronger witch, she is content with the duties of running her own shop and is comforted by the fact that her beloved whore (her feline relative) is being looked after by her beloved aunt. you will recognize the aunt of "Murder for Death". this movie is fun and touchingly sweet, boasting some spectacular wit and a nice witching sensation. worth a look.
