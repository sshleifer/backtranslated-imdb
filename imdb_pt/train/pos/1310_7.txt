** SPOILERS ** Highly charge the police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of Riverside, Wisconsin. Who is being chased by the local police using police officer Gina Pulasky, Helen Hunt, as a decoy in disguise to catch him. <br /> <br /> Nothing new in this made-for-TV movie you have not seen before, but the depth of the acting and script is unusually good and brings a lot to do not only with the killer, but also with the police officer. as a lover of his fellow officer, state of mind. <br /> <br /> Having been placed under psychiatric care after firing on an unstable and armed attacker, he attacked his partner with an assault rifle. Officer Palusky has the task of infiltrating to approach the suspicious killer Kayle Timler, Steven Webber. He was then positively identified by Sahsa girl Kim Kluznick, who saw him not far from where little Timmy Curtis was found, killed 18 times the next day. <br /> <br /> Getting a job at Mr. "C" Diner where Tim works Ginny becomes very friendly with him and then tells him in order to get Tim to open up about him possibly being the killer in series that she once killed in a hit-and-run accident a 79-year-old woman. <br /> <br /> Tim, who is said to have an IQ genius does not seem to catch on to Gina's attempt to arrest him, even when he later sees her in a bowling alley with his fellow police officers spending a night out. Playing some weird cat-and-mouse game with your Tim at one point, get Ginny at the end of the knife to admit she's connected. But Gina tells him that she was forced to do this by police to get a break and early release from prison. Aside from Tim's instability and criminal actions, we find that Ginny is not there either. She seems to be suffering from the fact that she was rejected by her father who abandoned her, with a drunk and mistreated mother, like a young woman doing her job. like a disguised police officer. <br /> <br /> There is also the fact that Gina's mistress, Will McCaid (Jeff Fahey), who is estranged from his wife and two children, who is also involved in serial killings, is very overprotective her. This causes Gina to almost end her disguise and later to be removed from her mission. Put in service disguised by his boss Captain Cheney (Dan Conway), despite McCaid's objections, after another 12-year-old boy, Davy Marish, was found murdered, Gina finally got it together and does Tim admit that he is the person responsible for the series of murders in the area. Ginny does this with a hidden recorder that she replaced the one she gave him to show how honest she is, hidden in her. <br /> <br /> The film "In The Dark Company" was not really so exceptional, but the performance of Helen Hunt and Jeff Fahey especially Steven Webber was. It was these high caliber performances that made the movie well above average for the TV movie.
