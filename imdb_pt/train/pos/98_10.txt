For me too, this Christmas special is one that I remember very fondly. In 1989, I got the 2 CDs I found from the soundtrack recording, giving one to my sister and keeping the other to me. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now, and I'd love to be able to see the show again instead of just remembering how I listen. <br /> <br /> It has been noticed elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances at the Muppet Show, and they did more of a special together. The good relationship between Denver and his fuzzy companions comes clearly here in a charming and entertaining show that is good for all ages.
