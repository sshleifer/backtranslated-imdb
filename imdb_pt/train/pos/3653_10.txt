Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this common movie ??? The cast gives a good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, He Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Whalin, a guy eternally diminished by her annoyance), but the direction is extremely annoying and the story is not so interesting and original. I can not believe a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): you are CRAZY !!!
