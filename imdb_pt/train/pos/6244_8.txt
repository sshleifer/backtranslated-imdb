Every country that has a working film industry has some sensible (and maybe some insane) artist who makes films that you can only fully understand when you are part of that country. I think Hundstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money to afford cars and big houses. And they're definitely doing a lot of weird stuff here, which may seem to them 'normal' because they're doing it all their life. From the normal human point of view, you can now easily follow the movie and get disgusted or fascinated and watch a beautiful piece of art films from Austria. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know people who see the Hundstage characters as the tumor of society. A society that is becoming more insane on a day-to-day basis, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, dig the social system from within. And you see people. Sitting in the park, standing on the corner of the opposite street, queues on the same line. Maybe you'll meet them at a bar or disco you can visit. You may even work with them at work or they may be living near your home. You start to hate them without knowing exactly why. You will try to escape - but you can not. Maybe you'll end up like them. But it seems 'normal' to you, because you're doing it all your life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. There are beautiful people ... but some of them are ugly too. There are a lot of people working hard trying their best ... but there are also some riding on the backs of others and destroying everything that the people of Austria have built so far. <br /> <br /> A very pessimistic movie.
