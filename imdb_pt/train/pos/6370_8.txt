To my surprise, I really enjoyed the last installment of the Disney animation. The movie had its downs, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also nice to see an animated Disney movie that was not a musical. I was pushed to the edge with Tarzan. Luckily they gave the music a rest. Another good feature of the film is that the comedy was not completely stupid (Ã  la Hercules), quite subtle, so it still made the kids laugh while they did not make the adults feel dizzy or just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was the excitement. With all the great animated films going on outside of the Disney studios, you'd think they'd go ahead and catch up a bit. There is something to be said for tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the history of Atlantis! Overall, the movie was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
