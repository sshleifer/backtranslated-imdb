After you get past the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of John Waters' finest. A wonderful cast, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for small children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately this movie was not mass produced, and most of the audience will have the opportunity to view it. If the opportunity hits, go see this movie.
