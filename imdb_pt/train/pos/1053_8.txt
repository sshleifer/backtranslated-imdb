Sisters In Law is done by the same directors of the curiously fascinating 'Divorce, Iranian Style', which was exactly as it was said when we got a glimpse of the divorce court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the judicial system of Cameroon in Africa . What is great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women, which is unusual for a country like this. Anyway, they deal with many men accustomed to getting involved with women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that it seems that women have made great strides in society, with legal divorce and the rights of women being recognized. Thus, judges often punish men for behaving primitively in these times. It does not mean that women appearing in court receive the smoother treatment. One of the film's main focuses is a case of child abuse by an aunt. Judges do not waste time attacking the woman in fury. And who said justice is no longer served? With these 2 behind the bench. They often perform maximum penalties! Already! You're going, girl!
