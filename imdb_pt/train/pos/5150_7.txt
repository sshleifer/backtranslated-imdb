Even though Ian Kershaw has distanced himself from this project because of inaccuracies about Hitler's life and yes, that is dramatized, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years during this documentary that deals only with Hitler from childhood until becoming Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV movie (also a two-part miniseries) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, the financial disaster of 1930. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and little else besides the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and full of interesting actors, but I feel I should have been more rigidly directed with stronger cinematography; most of the actors are portrayed in half-body photos, which (for me) contributes to a theatrical, not cinematic posture. The tempo is sometimes drowsy and the movie suffers approximately 2.5 hours in length.
