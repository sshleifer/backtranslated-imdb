With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films appear to be double-edged swords. You will get something incredible out of it, but only if you tolerate the silly and unnecessarily daring. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that may not have always shone in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a great achievement of Bakshi from the point of view of animation. Rotoscopy is much more detailed and the animation has a vibrant appearance. You still get some of the stem cells and slightly blurred background paintings, but overall the appearance has definitely improved since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has a realistic, almost naturalist style and, unlike LOTR, in which this style used to disagree with the actual content, it enhances the unique atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film can not create a meaningful story from its simple environment and, in fact, most of the characters' motivations are blurry. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the main villain, Necron, was difficult to follow not to mention That Guy with Furry Face Mask (aka "That Guy"). Even though most of the voice actors were appropriate, there are some weird quirks in the audio department and the Tigra especially sounds really awful when she's screaming. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the film's inherent value outweighs its time unnecessarily. foolish execution of the plot. The scarce character coating is something you will never get over but it helps you remember that maybe this movie is not meant to be taken very seriously. It's still a cool and funny thing.
