The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time I knew it appeared on TV in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and me and my dad were watching in the living room just before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time, but I'm not sure who was most terrified walking through the church yard to the church entrance that night, me or my father. <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this. film that makes it so scary, but I think one of them is the fact that there is not much on the soundtrack that touches the background of almost every Hollywood movie, so every squeak, thump and bang is more amplified in your head like there is no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories, there is no leap factor involved as things spring out of the closet, so not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a clever way, since nothing scares you more than your own mind by making a riot by thinking of what is on the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A superb story of ghosts, I've never seen anything that could match that and with all the scum that is repeated on TV I can not believe that the BBC has deleted it afterwards (as far as I know) showing!
