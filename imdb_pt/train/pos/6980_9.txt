I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this program before any information was divulged about it. I determined it would be an inexpensive unfolding led by Ronald D. Moore wielding the wand of rets. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot makes a great impression on the viewers. The accessibility is wonderful! Of course, experienced veterans of BSG will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on developing the Cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also allows newcomers to clearly present their plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are introduced to an immersive brain drama, punctuated by provocative, daring and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply amazing. Morales's portrait of Joseph Adama, inspired by William's portrait of Olmos, gives a wonderful glimpse of William's heroic father. Dr. Graystone's portrait of Stoltz raises many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is an indication of what is yet to come, RDM and the creative team should continue with the legacy of BSG in the first place. - Television programming with another masterfully mastered television masterpiece.
