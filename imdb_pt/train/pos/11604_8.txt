In the seemingly endless quest to find well-made and well-played horror films, it is very rare to find one that arrives remotely close to reaching the target. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across "Burned at the Stake" on a US cable network while I was flipping channels. The premise is reasonably simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most vehement witness against alleged witches, leveling unfounded accusations against anyone who obtains their displeasure. Manipulating it for its own purposes is the Reverend Parris (Peters), who also serves as the court's guide to matters relating to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann begins to accuse the members of the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (1980 or later), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Witch Museum of Salem. A strange man in the seventeenth-century costume tries to approach her there and in the building. He continues to chase her as strange phenomena begin to engulf her more and more. Therefore, it seems that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, a more detailed description involves a lot and would do a lot. Although the film is not action-oriented and likely to be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in the many flashbacks of the film sounds very convincing. The production values ​​are solid, with the possible exception of some of the special effects. On a side note, the film's technical consultant was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Viewers who enjoy a well-done, atmospheric, yet understated horror film can appreciate it. Writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in science fiction and horror movies and is best known for his work on several big bug films and similar works years before.
