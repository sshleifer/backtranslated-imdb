What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've all seen the Matrix. The creators of The Matrix say it's "inspired anime." Just from watching the trailer to this classic, you can see where they got the plot. <br /> <br /> The movie is kind of set in 80's Japan, and it really shows. The costumes, songs and words (in the recent English version of AD Vision) are all as if they had been directly withdrawn from the time. I believe it was made at that time too, but due to certain points in the plot, this does not date the movie! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed by referring to the Matrix, the world is not real. . It's not really the 1980s. Actually, it's something more like the 2480s. After a nuclear war, the Earth's ecosystem (or "Biosphere Prime") was destroyed. The survivors are forced to flee into space, where the conflict continued. Once the planets (or "Biospheres") were abandoned, people began living in MegaZones - cities within spaceships, where through hypnotism and the Truman Show illusion techniques they believed we were back on Earth. in the most peaceful time of recent memory ... The 80s. When young Shogo gets a mysterious motorcycle with advanced appearance, this leads him to discover more than he supposedly knows ... The Garland (a bike that turns into a mech), a weapon of the years 2400, helps Shogo to escape the military pursuit. As more and more is discovered about MegaZone, war is coming home, and due to conflicts between the army and the computer, war comes to MegaZone too ... I apologize if these points are seen as spoilers, but the plot is basically described in this way in the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions run high in this movie, even more so than Matrix. You really believe the war is happening, and Shogo really gets pretty scared of what he's discovering. What begins as a cool 1980s movie becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cutouts we've been running in bullet time in The Matrix. There really is the sense of suffering that people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy and a war. It may choke you to the end ... I know this has happened to me. <br /> <br /> Animation is awesome for the day, and the picture quality on the ADVision DVD is unbelievable for the age. The artistic style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for a lot of violence and blood, there is also a scene of erotic sex. <br /> <br /> The ending can be seen as a 'can not be final', similar to the Matrix, or supposedly can be followed by the sequel, which I have not yet had the pleasure of watching. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best animes I've ever seen, actually one of the best movies I've seen, and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time. <br /> <br /> I need to recommend the ADVision DVD, since their interpretation of the English language is incredible, and makes the movie justice, and can be bought with an artbox to keep the two sequels when they are released, which will have the same vocal cast. <br /> <br /> In all, the MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie, and deserves to be is highly important and should be essential in the collection of any anime fan. My goodness, even my mother liked it.
