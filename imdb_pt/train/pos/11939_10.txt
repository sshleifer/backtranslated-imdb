I always liked this great baseball movie! It has a good cast, including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Tony Longza, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and acts from all the actors in the movie! The baseball scenes are all lifelike! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits the movie very well! Some of the actors who reminded me of the real baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's character, Ray Mitchell, recalled Me Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders' commentator, in My Opinion, recalled how Al Hrabosky looks like today. This is a fantastic movie for non-baseball fans and I highly recommend this movie!
