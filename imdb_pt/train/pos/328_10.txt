Fascinating I approached is curious (yellow) and is companion with great trepidation. I had read numerous reports on his widely discussed controversy and explicit sex. What I got was not that, but a provocative and engaging movie experience, completely different from any other. I sincerely believe that most commentators who felt the film was "lame" or "boring" approached the film as if it were pornography. Maybe this is pornography, assuming that pornography is something meant to excite the senses, but it is intentionally non-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws everything into her performance, giving her a realistic and human reality that is simply compelling and enduring. Her breasts may be flaccid, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat, and her chubby face. But at the end of the movie, the audience identifies with it and accepts its faults as humans. This touch gives you even more credibility to the need. If the director had launched a Briget Bardot bomb, the effect would have been nullified. I would not recommend this piece more thought-provoking. Be prepared to invest a lot in thinking about this deliberately stimulated film. The patient and unpretentious spectator will be completely rewarded in the way most other films could dream of.
