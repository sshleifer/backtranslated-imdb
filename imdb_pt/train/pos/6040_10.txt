I just never get tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra, so I was involved from the beginning. I kept in touch with Jon and helped promote the movie in the Cinemas and now in the DVD release. Even to the point of distributing promotional postcards in multi-channel ferries and in various places in France. FREEBIRD has been expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments as well as cast choice. Only Phil Daniels could fit into Grouch's role. Great privilege to meet Jon and the cast at the party after the prime minister in January. Anything you want to do, just ask, either by email or by phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
