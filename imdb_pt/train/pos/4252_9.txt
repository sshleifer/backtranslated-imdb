this movie takes you into yourself in the first few minutes and holds you to the end. has a very human history and very good music selected. The performance of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. Recommended for people who get tired of action movies and want to see a good movie.
