Of course it may not be a classic, but it's a full of classic lines. One of the few movies my friends and I quote all the time and that's fifteen years later (maybe it was Cinemax many times!) Michael Keaton is the worst actor in this movie - he can not figure out how to play it - but he is surrounded by a fantastic cast who knows exactly how to play this parody. Looking for a movie to cheer you up? That's it, but rent it with your friends - this will make it even better.
