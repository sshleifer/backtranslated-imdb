Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for freedom for India ignored his own family and son, this film is about his son Hiralal who feels neglected because of Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film begins in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights India's cause of freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a lawyer, since Gandhi was involved in the fight for freedom, he wanted his wife and children also to participate as a service to society and as a result the hirarlal did not have the chance to complete his education and fail his examinations, he marries his love gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against the will of his father. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become a lawyer like his father, but his own father refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by an entrepreneur and instead gives the other person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to your family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony. This infuriates hiralism and increases the gap between father and son, Hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and guilt for being ignorant and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to survive and hits the streets through failed business attempts and in great debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna gave a stellar performance as Hiralal gandhi .. all the praise for him, the direction and the script is fantastic, the picturization is excellent. Overall a great movie and a must see. I give a 10/10
