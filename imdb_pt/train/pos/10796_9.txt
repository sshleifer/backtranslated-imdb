If you're a fan of one or both, Chuck Norris and Judson Mills, then this is the movie to see. He has a lot of adventure in him. It's a great continuation of President's Man. The chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. My personal opinion. This film along with the original went so well, that networks should consider turning it into a regular series. If you've seen the President's Man, I recommend this movie to you. If you've seen the President's Man: A Line in the Sand, but you have not seen the President's Man, let me suggest that you do. You will not be disappointed with any of them.
