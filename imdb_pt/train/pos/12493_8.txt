After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indies) produced, we finally got a movie that offers some scary moments. There are a few clich√©s moments, but I'm not sure if it is possible these days to make a totally original movie. There is not much news here ... it's well done. <br /> <br /> Be sure and pay attention, as "subtle" scares come quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while you are eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very well-written red herring in this film and unfortunately a very badly cast paper. Cheri Christian simply does not make an effective Julie (the wife / mother). On the one hand, she is totally unfriendly. I know, I know ... she just went through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows her as she "normally" is and the relationship between her and her husband is uncomfortable (in an unintended way). I think the director wanted us to have some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a positive sign towards the end, which is at once disturbing and satisfying. It could easily have been trivialized with a sound effect at the beginning of the final credits, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it is a good, old-fashioned one. scary movie ... something that is quite rare nowadays.
