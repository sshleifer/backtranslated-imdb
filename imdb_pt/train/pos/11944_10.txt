I was going to give an 8, but since you made 6.5 of much better votes, I had to increase my contribution. The river Styx was pure genius. Of course, Woody was his perennial material, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious, and so the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was clever enough, and Woody's card tricks at parties, along with the reaction from the top of the crust, were fun to watch. That was much better than the newspaper critics did seem. And a plus, a little wizard apprentice to follow along. And, of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit sloppy? Charles Dance is always fun, just like Hugh Jackman.
