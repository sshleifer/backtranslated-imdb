This is the second short of the Animatrix, and the first of them is what one could call "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a run time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human," or attempts to direct hatred toward man for his "sins against the machine." I do not think this is true; uses only the robots to show us that as human beings we are not particularly receptive or open-minded to someone other than ourselves. I'd say you do a great job. The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document, telling what led to one of the main conflicts of the trilogy. Thus, it contains clips of fiction and related articles. The dubbing is very good, if there is not much of it. The animation is pleasant, and the use of color, despite the generally realistic drawing style, makes it more open to make smooth transitions and other surreal images. This has several pieces of violence and disturbing visuals, plus a bit of nudity. The disc contains a commentary, not in English, but with subtitles, and worth listening / reading. There is also a well-made and informative, based on both sides, so I would advise you to see it after seeing the next one, too. I recommend this to anyone who likes the Matrix universe, and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
