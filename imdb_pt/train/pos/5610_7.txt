Roman Polanski masterfully directs this kind of variation on the same theme of Repulsion. I can not imagine that there is an honest cinema goer who can not recognize the excellent director of Le Locataire, but both parts of the brochure may not be entirely satisfactory to most people, including me. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self-confidence that soon would gradually become psychological unrest, for becoming an irreversible physical malaise. The shared ordeal for the characters and the audience is very different from the fright and tension of horror films, as there are no tangible supernatural elements here. While horror movies allow some kind of catharsis (whether cheap or more elaborate) sadistic Polanski torture us, and if in his last opus the black humor is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the expectations of the public (alternatively deceiving and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a much bigger achievement because pure paranoia and common rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange apartment while we are forced to identify with a single character. What's more, if the elements of fantasy are all in the hero's mind, the situation is very uncomfortable, since we viewers are forced to judge it, to reject it as we were masterfully drawn ("paint the bait") to he.
