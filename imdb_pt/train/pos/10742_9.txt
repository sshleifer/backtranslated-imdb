Movie difficult to comment on, how do you say it's bad? Well, it's not, but it's equally hard to say it's good. What it is, it's a convincing sight, it's the closest you'll ever defile the devastation without being there. It's the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand, you know you want to get away, but you have to watch. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers deal with the comment very well, even in the most tragic of circumstances, there is an insight into something that is happening in another country, neither panders nor insults. The facts are about cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can not change the story, and you should not want to, this movie is a testimony of humanity in its darkest hour.
