This movie is probably for you. It had a general meditative quality of music, for beautiful photography, and listening to the often clich√©d things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say how worked or between shots. If you're familiar with Buddhism, that's the kind of sense I took from this movie. The impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused and finally forced me to leave unfinished (I saw more than an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing. You just find out why he's commissioned, and how he can afford to live that kind of job. The work of art comes to life, but all its talk without conclusions leads to dead ends.
