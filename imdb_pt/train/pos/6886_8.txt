This is unlike any other movie, the closest thing I can compare is a Woody Allen movie ... But since Woody Allen is constantly seeing human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to be trying to figure out a way to deal with it. an incapacitating insecurity that tends to define us for better or for worse. In the case of Lou, it is the cause of your stuttering, which can be traced back to a singular infant trauma that is revealed through flash backs. <br /> <br /> There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world. I believe they all deserve a chance for redemption, though the diversity of human character is ultimately what makes the world such an intriguing place, so perhaps we should not fix our neurosis any more than we should fix our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an indie movie shot on a long shoestring, but the production values ​​are tremendous as is the scope of the movie. I feel it is a peculiar gem for the self-help market. I really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next, I could imagine a career in the mold of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when a guy like that breaks, he comes out and does "X MEN" and his humble quirkiness. origins are soon forgotten or are ... X Men is a bunch of freaks if I remember correctly :)
