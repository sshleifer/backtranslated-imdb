This was a really good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and as it is not about diet, it's about having such a deep pain that they have to find a way to handle it and they choose it. Beth was a very well-designed character and in the scene where she confronts her mother about the eating disorder, you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain she is feeling. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth yells the words, "It's not about you." for her mother. These words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in the movie.
