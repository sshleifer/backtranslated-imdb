A masterful treatment of "The Postman Always Stands Twice" by James Caine as the first Luchino Visconti film filmed primarily around Ferrara in war-torn Italy. The original negative was considered destroyed, but Visconti saved a copy and, fortunately, we can see this neo-realistic work of today. Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently revealed their breasts in La Cena delle beffe) (1941), star as the sexy and ill-fated lovers who plan to kill her husband. Not as good as the French "Le Dernier tournant" (1939), but probably better than the American version (1946) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles, highly recommended.
