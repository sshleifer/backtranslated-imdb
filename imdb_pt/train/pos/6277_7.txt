Good action and interesting plot. Having seen the original, I must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the film. Good cast .. significant acting .. although it would be nice to see a little more expansion in the action scenes, rather than the background story. Fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7/10 is a right vote I guess!
