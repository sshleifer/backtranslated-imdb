I saw this movie about twenty years ago at the end of the show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underestimated as an actor, since most critics saw him as a solid and almost bland man, and women simply loved watching his films because of their appearance. This film, however, proved what an interesting actor it could be. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is your best performance. He is totally believable in a truly vile role. From what I read, he was a hard-working, quiet guy in real life and never fought enough for that kind of role. He would basically do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have dealt with more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how boring the character Lloyd Nolan was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really pissed me off. The last scene of the movie stayed with me for all these years. This movie definitely deserves a look.
