I was so excited to see this movie because I always heard it was very scary. <br /> <br /> What is interesting is that it is a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it with the original crew of Japan! I think that this made the movie ... more Japanese (which is probably why it succeeded unlike most Japan horror films failures to America), but also made it somewhat inaccessible to the American public. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film. This worked well at times when they intended to capture the main character's nervous fear: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unknown lake in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The plot was also quite confusing. In typical Japanese fashion, it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story and from there we constantly move back and forth until at the end of the movie we see the end and the beginning of the whole story. This constant change in time was very confusing for me. Also, I do not think some things have been explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequence that apparently reveals most of the story). <br /> <br /> Overall, there's plenty for the American public to love, tons of weird images and macabre details that are a healthy twist of jumping scenes.
