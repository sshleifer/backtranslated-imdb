"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and was clear and direct. In fact, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic lighting, see something else. And he's not at all a tearjerker. But I mean that in a positive way. It shows two men who love each other and how the affliction with AIDS is affecting the quality of their daily lives. It's almost hard for me to say whether it was a quality movie or not, because I was so naked I needed to find other ways to respond. It is an admirable film, in fact one of the most admirable and sincere documents I have ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. This makes hollow-wood productions about AIDS seem misaligned and heartless. These men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to Mark and says goodbye is the real thing.
