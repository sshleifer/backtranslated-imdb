I like this movie because it's a good movie job, done by people who care enough to make art and not just home movies. He's full of home movies from Super Surfer Greg Noll, and a bunch of other amateur videos that line up with his 50-year passion. However, it has expanded to the point of approaching aesthetic glory. It is full of artistic talent and athletic talent, no matter how trivial you may think you are a surfer. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Neither are surgeons (maybe) or Ph.d's (again, maybe). Believe in the surfer's quest. Believe in the beauty of the human fool. Believe in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. The surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the northern beach of a Hawaiian island, attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years earlier. It celebrates the downtime of a country that has waged a cold war - instead of a hot war - with the Russian Socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It's dangerous, but just a bit historic. I suspect that Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to leave and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he received. This movie has no military heroes. He has no weapons. The only beachhead surfers win a beer-stand and surfboard shop. It's not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.
