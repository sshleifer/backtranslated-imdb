I really liked this movie. The story goes back and forth a bit and is not easy to follow. There is no resolution to the story, and you wonder what really happened. Since I like this kind of movie I liked that. I especially like the "dating" scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives. And of course any movie with a naked Rideau Staphane will have some extra points. ;-)
