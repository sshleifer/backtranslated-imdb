Petter Mattei "Love in the Time of Money" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> This being a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present in New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Each is connected in one way or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Elegantly, the film has a sophisticated and luxurious look. We are led to see how these people live and the world in which they live in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing you get from all these souls in the picture are the different stages of loneliness that each inhabit. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find sincere satisfaction, as discerned is the case of most of the people we meet. <br /> <br /> The performance is good under Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come to life. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and look forward to the next work.
