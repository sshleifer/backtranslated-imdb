The movie is a fantasy. The plot is fine, but serves as the framework upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully. (I still can not believe that such beautiful and attractive people could sing this well.) Some of the dialogues are wonderfully intelligent. The clothes made me feel like I was attending a haute couture fashion show of 1942. <br /> <br /> Movies are designed for various purposes. This one is designed to entertain and certainly does. If I have a negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the handsome, dashing earl. Some of the closes made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing beautifully. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as gorgeous as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is well before my time, and I am new in the films of Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and related conversations. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love classic rock that fills most modern movies, there is no doubt in my mind that this song is simply and clearly more memorable, nicer, better built. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see today in theaters. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills, was prettier than the stars I see today. I'm not sure why so many other posters apologize for liking this movie and, more generally, for this group of movies. They say it is dated and they try to explain why it is so. And those who do not like it say it's not very good, but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly be fun when so many other films have been forgotten for a long time. There is a lot of quality in every way in this movie to not be remembered and appreciated. I recommend this movie without reservations for those who enjoy great talent, lots of beauty and lots of music.
