We saw this at one of the local art theaters in the Montrose area in Houston, TX. It was a total surprise compared to the article in the theater newsletter, but we were both amazed by the art. It was beautifully done and (apparently) photographed on a schloss (German name for ch√¢teau) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relations of a group of twenty-one men and women isolated from the day-to-day restrictions. It's fantastic on more levels than I remember. We got home after the movie, we talked and talked until 4 in the morning the next day. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly), so there should be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the video. film in the German version (probably original). I searched and searched for a video tape version, but I never found anything. Absolutely love to have a VHS or DVD version of it. It explores relationships on a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince him to release again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine getting tired of watching the sincere performance of the actors who are now probably in their forties. Please bring it back.
