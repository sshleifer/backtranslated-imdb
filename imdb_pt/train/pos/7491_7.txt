Years ago, I found a "bargain" copy of this movie for a dollar or two. In many ways, this is very appropriate, as when it was made in 1933, it was actually a cheap movie made by the studio "poverty", Majestic. However, while the film is quite derivative, it is still worth watching and provides some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very, very familiar, as in some German cities, people are upset because of some recent deaths that seem to be the work of vampires! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield on Dracula, and here he is very, very much alike - though he plays a far more harmless weirdo. In this case, he is obsessed with his pet bats and people start to blame him for the killings. The film does a good job of providing some "false leads" (ie, false leads), and while it does not take a genius to figure out that Frye may not be responsible, WHO and WHY are intriguing and make it VERY different of the average horror movie. In addition, while production had little money to speak of, it still had some good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios studios at night (when they finished filming the day). . As a result, the film looks pretty good on the whole, although I also felt that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible - he did not think this did noticeably lessen the film. I've seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I've noticed that her characters have no depth - she always seems to be climbing like the "screaming woman" and provides little news in each movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, for fans of old horror movies, this is great and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it is probably something that can be ignored.
