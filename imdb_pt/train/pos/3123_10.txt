This is the first 10 out of 10 I gave to any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there are no slow parts, great acting, intelligent writing. I also liked the style of filming, where the shaking and the different angles just made it seem like you're part of the scene. Finally, I could see an action movie that does not try to please all sectors of the audience (ie there is no forced romance). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this movie. . <br /> <br /> Attention - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
