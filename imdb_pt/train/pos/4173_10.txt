A kind of road movie on old-fashioned trains in the late summer province of the Slowenian. At first you see someone in their underwear sewing black cloth pants, and when the same young man in black pants leaves home with two suitcases, you see that the pants part is missing in a flag of mourning (apparently his father has died). On the train he meets a young woman, and almost speechless, but many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. It's a surreal movie, very poetic and a bit bizarre, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
