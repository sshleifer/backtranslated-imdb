I was 5 when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration to achieve my goals that I have prepared to accomplish since that time! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a "backstage" entertainment industry during the late 1950s, "Sparkle" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters in search of their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what might materialize when things seem to happen too fast and the models are not available to help. <br /> <br /> Phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack brings the plot to every song. If they are subject to situations that almost leave no choice for strong and long-term decision-making, to make the final sacrifice in order to progress, the three young girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent the different routes that can be taken when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This movie could have spawned the ideas of creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway, and "Glitter" by Mariah Carey 25 years later. As a member of the original audience of both productions, I saw many similarities in the two stories for "Sparkle" as well as "Saturday Night Fever," "Fame," "Flashdance," and the great off-Broadway hit "Mommy, I Want to Sing ".
