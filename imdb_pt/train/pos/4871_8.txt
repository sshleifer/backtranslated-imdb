It takes a Serbian or at least Balkan familiarity to understand and appreciate many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet', as well as many other Kusturica films. Take for instance the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, nostalgia for the good days of the communist regime and the awakening of the people. young brat watching his naked teacher at the sound of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to get away from the tragic history of Serbia described in his earlier films, but creates a whole world of himself in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political movie or an explicit political film in any case. It's a fun movie first of all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active part in this film, as well as in all his other films. His style is straightforward and grotesque, now what he feels about his characters and we know he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops combines history, present and magic, and the colors seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is also not a perfect movie. The main flaw is the extension, some issues and shortening would have been useful, since at some point the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions appear. It is still one of the most attractive, fun and exciting movies I have seen lately.
