Cinematography - Compared to 'The Wrestler', a degree of verita and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer, and then hypnotizes as well. <br /> <br /> Acting - Dialogue is minimal, but the pauses are silence and pungent. <br /> <br /> History - The conflict in a Balkanized Denmark is volatile, as we have recently seen jihad murders in the Netherlands and riots in France.

Even her worst. . . I stop here to avoid the spoiler.
