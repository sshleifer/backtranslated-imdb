This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite films by Pabst and I liked them more than their most famous films, starring Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). It is probably because both are very similar to the neo-realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 1950s. This style film called for the use of non-actors (typical people only) in everyday situations to create intensely engaging and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles look like miners - not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided on the border and German workers are not welcome at the French mine, despite there being higher unemployment in Germany. That, language differences (beautifully illustrated in a dance hall scene) and World War I conspire to create a huge divide between factions - resulting in a WE vs. THE. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is a real camaraderie between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to make the German public see futility. of war and hatred. It was a wonderfully touching movie with some of the scariest, most claustrophobic images I've ever seen. Considering the story, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, just like this, WESTFRONT 1918, JACACUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately failed to positively influence public opinion. So, from the historical point of view, it is an incredible and sad relic that is worth seeing.
