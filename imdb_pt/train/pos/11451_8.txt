A very engaging documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of stones, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which disintegrates when the tide comes to the beach or the wind blows in the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works do not last except as photos or movies than they were. Now, it may be argued that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but it is no longer easy to say that what he does is just a fine art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in decrepit urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who loves the nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure that these are the same reasons why it is avoided by some people in the art world who found their works as cute or shallow).
