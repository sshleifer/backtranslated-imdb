and whoever watches this movie will agree. This film was directed at the days when the plot, the credibility of the character and the theme really mattered. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is at her best as an informant "Moe", she survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a pigeon pigeon for NYC police. <br /> <br /> The only other film I've seen Peters in is "Niagara" and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti-hero who must discern what is the right thing despite his need for money. <br /> <br /> The photograph is brilliant. The neon, subway station (although it looks cleaner than the real thing!), The harbor hut where Widmark lives like a transient. Excellent use is made of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is an astounding backdrop. 10/10.
