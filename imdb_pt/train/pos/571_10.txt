Watching how the two brothers interact and feed each other throughout the film, I am personally happy to live in the countryside as they did in the film. I have watched this movie countless times and I have the book next to my Bible. After watching the film I agree that this is one of the few movies that does justice to a book. I strongly recommend anyone who has a chance to go to Montana to fish or be outdoors to do it. It is wonderful. I can not think of anyone else who could play the role better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself justice and watch one of the best movies of the modern movie era. We recommend And as a guide for fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly with fish in the scenes of the film because although it looks great in the movie, you have no idea how much practice and fishing skill actually takes. Thanks for listening Watch this movie, please, if you want a long and sad movie.
