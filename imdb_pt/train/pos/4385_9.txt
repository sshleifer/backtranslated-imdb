What can you say about a movie that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic, and occasionally weirder - I will not say "nice". Will I say "charismatic" villains in the history of cinema, and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their prime? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest struggle of man for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very touching, tender and sensual.
