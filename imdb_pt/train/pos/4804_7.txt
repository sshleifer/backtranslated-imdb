I watched this movie on DVD a few times now, the first time, I watched the second half after the time and then came back for the first hour. a fun and engaging film, thank goodness at kiera knightley, refreshing and gives us all a genuine insight into Queen Victoria's difficult life and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad with the movie, no bad language or something sexual that offends the family. It may lead kids to research a little about Queen Victoria and perhaps lesser-known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne.
