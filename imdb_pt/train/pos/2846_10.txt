I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago ... And I want to thank the people who worked on creating this movie! Not the best or the most .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I'd like to understand for myself ... it's easy and affordable ... it's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day with no regrets about wasted time watching you! It is about love and care, about life that we have, but sometimes we lose because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have, but we miss it. ... why do we do this? We need to live as if we were dying ... we would worry every second and remember: if we do good things, good things will come back to us! Happiness is real. . and have a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! Thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
