Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a film about traditional Japanese "yokai" or "monsters" of folklore. It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade. The yokai of the first installment includes the beak beak, water kappa imp, a live 'brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face in the back of the head, a priest dwarf with a huge fist like a gourd, and so on. <br /> <br /> These types of capricious monsters derive not only from folklore but also from a Tokugawa-era summer entertainment type, comparable to today's haunted houses on Halloween day, or to the "freaks" of yesteryear , but with exclusively false aberrations. Ghosts and goldfish monsters and one-headed umbrellas were forced to create "shivers" during the hot summers. The fat woman and such was recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters represented in medieval parchments; And if their design for the movie is a bit simple and hoky, this makes them even more representative of what has historically been recreated for summer chills. <br /> <br /> These sympathetic monsters have to confront and destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who came to Japan and disguised himself as Lord Samurai. Although some of the Japanese appearances are a little ridiculous, and many of the costumes are scarcely more than masks without even wiggling their lips as they speak, everything is played with a poker face and is very charming. It has a beautiful cinematography, as would be the case with a CGI film of the same decade. Seen in good humor or with the right friends, it's exciting, moving and touching. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX director of the excellent trilogy Daimajin. The Yokai Monsters series is not equal to Majin at its best, but the Yokai are a lot of fun. The first miike movie that is the most child-oriented of his family's movies, with GOZU & IZOO consecutively more serious, though none too severe for young viewers.
