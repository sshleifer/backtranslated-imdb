It was simple and yet so cool. I think the whole sense of sexual segregation in society, which may be bitter, has been shown very gently. There was a bitter kind of hummer in her. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the film more tangible and more realistic. There was a "documentary" side to the film as well. The best scenes were those that all the girls, forbidden to watch, listened with passion to the soldier, who should keep an eye on them, transmitting the game. If you are an Iranian, the familiar cheering and dancing on the streets after a game has won, fills you with national pride !! If you're not Iranian, you'll still love it!
