This film begins with a family that was going in different directions and its teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne) who suddenly walks on her daughter and Zack kissing and then all sorts of problems seem to surface. Jill Dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the house quite often. There are also major issues that occur when the family decides to go in a camp that their daughter Olivia does not like and can not adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out of all the insects. In many ways, Olivia does a great performance as a teenager and Nick Mancuso, (Richard Grant) plays a big supporting role as a hotel owner. This movie will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a movie full of horror and terror. Appreciate
