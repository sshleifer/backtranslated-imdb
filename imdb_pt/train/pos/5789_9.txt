This is one of my favorites along with the episodes of Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and Agnes Moorhead-and-the-little-spacers. <br /> <br /> It was an important takeover in mid-1961 in the long Cold War that the US was then involved in. The scene of the battered city, the sparse dialogue of the almost-hungry characters, their worn uniforms and the minimal action "says" everything: the absurdity of a conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that is sweet and redeemer on this. <br /> <br /> It is a "fable" because it was done at a time in which events occurred differently, such as the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962); would have been a reasonable representation of one of the major US cities, ruined and filled with a few miserable survivors. . I also see it as a "fable" because it is not just a warning story, but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story set in an impossible situation involving two highly mismatched lovers.
