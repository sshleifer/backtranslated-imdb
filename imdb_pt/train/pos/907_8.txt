It is a joint family history showing all the ethics that each person should follow while communicating with each relative around. Shahid Kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with Amrita Rao, who is also very Desi and she also acts very well ... The genre of the film is the same as HAHK and such films deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional values. .The movies do not have 10, because it is not very good in music, which counts a lot in each movie, besides, it is flawless ....
