Airwolf The Movie, A variation of the original 2-part pilot, However, the film, although shorter, contains extra images Invisible in the 2-hour pilot The pilot is much more pilot than the film Where the pilot film is usually the even 2 parter combined) But the film is actually a different edition with extras here and cuts there. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look, even if you have the season 1 DVD set, I would still get a copy of The "Movie" is still in some stores like Virgin, Woolworths and Mixed Media Stores , though it usually needs ordering but saves the need to buy online (as many of us still do not or rely on online shopping), but if you look around for airwolfs in the shops <br /> <br /> Airwolf was actually one of the most voted shows of the 80s. A full-size Airwolf is being rebuilt for a Helicopter Museum:) Info and work in progress photos are on http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games He looks like he's finally staying :)
