Bar some of the questionable actors (there are musicians at the end of the day), this in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is "The best rock movie ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, but without rap - a young musician, trying to show himself to the local community as he struggled to deal with a broken home and a rival band. Add sexual interest and truly exceptional performances, this is the real 8 miles. <br /> <br /> Prince provides solid performance, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good direction, great plot and spectacular performances. Not forgetting the best rock / pop / funk music you'll ever hear.
