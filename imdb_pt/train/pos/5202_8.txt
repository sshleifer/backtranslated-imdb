I just watched this version of "Samhain", and although I still like it, it's nothing like the "rough" version I have. If you check the message board, you'll see an apology from the director for this reduced version, 79 minutes, and he says it had nothing to do with this reduced edition trimmed to a whole new end. Christian really does not have to distance himself that much, because the basic elements of blood still hold, even if they are highly trimmed. This is a shame because it has the potential to be one of the meanest and meanest movies in years. It still has porn stars, and inborn ones, and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen. I'm happy to have this "hard cut" because for me, it's a gem for any library of gorehounds. Christian Viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and we hope his next project will be better produced. The idiots had a classic almost in their hands and spoiled everything for everyone. "Samhain" may be one of the most controversial and ill-treated horror films of all time, and the others could not see what the director intended. *********** ******************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my comment based on the "print job" of SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. There is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no audio in the dialog, because I think they should be looped later. However, most of the movie has audio with sound effects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a hint to insert when the movie is finished. It's just as it says, a "Rough Cut", BUT the only uncut version of "Samhain" you'll probably see. Reason, because the blood is extremely graphic, much more than an NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are only there for murder and to add some sugar and seasoning. The story is quite normal, American vacationers on holiday in Ireland and end up staying in a house in the middle of the woods. An area that is heavy in folklore, involving the ancient Druids and the celebration of Samhain, or what we call Halloween. (scary) <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a huge dose of blood, as a couple of camp is attacked by one of the innate local mutants. This is a big bloody scene, when the guy finds his girl hanging on a cliff, with her crying for help. All he sees is his head, arms and shoulders dangling in front of him and when he pulls her up, she has been completely cut in two. That's what I would call EXTREME GORE, with guts, blood and broken limbs all over the place. We are in the territory of Herschell Gordon Lewis staff here, except the effects seem much more realistic. I'll just skip the story because it's your standard stalk and kill the plot. <br /> <br /> The next scene is something to be seen, as the boyfriend of the first murder is taken to a cave as the place (Things of TCM-2), and attached to a table. This geek then cuts all his limbs (off the camera with a suggestion to insert a scene), and then we see his torso on a barbecue, spinning slowly over a campfire, and the torso has a horny (if you can believe in that). Yes, very bad taste, disgusting, horrible, you find the right word, and probably will fit as well. <br /> <br /> So, later Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, is cut from the neck to the groin, and all her bowels are plucked in joy, and her blood drains into a pan. Yummy, a real upset, huh? <br /> <br /> But the best crime scene takes place indoors, and I have to admit, this is one of the best scenes I've ever seen. This guy (no matter who) is caught behind a nerd, and opens it in the hole. The nerd then puts his hands in and pulls out all the guys, guts, guts, and what the hell's over, straight from your idiot. This goes on forever as the guy is screaming and more and more bowels are pulled out by putting the entire bathroom floor. This is so extreme, so exaggerated, that I caught myself laughing to hell. Obviously, you will NEVER see this scene on an appropriate DVD, IMO, along with most other extreme scenes. <br /> <br /> So what to think of all this. Well, first of all, even though I doubt that this movie will be released in this totally uncut presentation, this makes this "Rough Cut" a rare gem for the gorehounds. Yes, it's a bit difficult at first, with no soundtrack, some scenes yet to be entered and credits that have names missing all over the place. But that's what makes it so unique, and I would not trade for anything now. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
