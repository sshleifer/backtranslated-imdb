Although derived, "Labyrinth" is still the highlight of the half of the six-year-old show. Finally, a story allows Welling to show how he grew up as an actor. It is not easy to interpret a character who is the personification of "truth, justice and the American way" weekly, with very little variation. His performance, allowing him to show how anyone could react if he found that everything he knew could be a lie, was believable enough. <br /> <br /> Welling rose to the occasion wonderfully. <br /> <br /> As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as the "disabled" Lex, has delivered, as well as Kristen Kreuk as a very sweet-to-be-credited Lana. Allison Mack, the ever-present Chloe, also scored as a somewhat "off-the-rocker" version. <br /> <br /> The use of an annoying buzz in the background added to the pitch of the plot and made for an engaging drama.
