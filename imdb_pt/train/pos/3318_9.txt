A very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addicted to light films, he hit a homerun for me. Lots of laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ball players and real references to previous Bosox failures. And how enjoyable was watching a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure a Kevin Costner who tries to get viewers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young couple in love with Jimmy Bosox's "jones." It was a bit crazy and off the left field, but there really are Sox fans who are fanatics and live their lives through the fate of their beloved team. The film was fast-paced and the final, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular films, without being overly pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was nice too Willie Garson's return to the screen. I miss the ever popular "Stanford Blatch" by Sex & the City. He is always funny, even when he does or talks very little. <br /> <br /> So buy two box seats, some popcorn and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
