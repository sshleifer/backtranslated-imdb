I'm 60 years old, I'm a guitarist (lead / rhythm), and for the last forty years, I've been in four bands, it's all there, fights, failures, spoiled food, the worst accommodations, always traveling, little or no money , and each was drunk or tall. But the clubs, the fans and the music made it all worth it! Just like weird fruit! I'm too old for that now, and the arthritis on my hands and hips does not mean swing anymore, but for the duration of the video, it all came back, and it was all there! The birds, the fights and the drink! And I was young again! It's like the voice of Billy Connolly, God likes the things of the 70's! Rock On Forever!
