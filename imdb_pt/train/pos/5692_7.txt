This is the second film based on the life and era of porn star John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based on your life. Maybe someday someone will make a movie about the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not very well told. There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists than Wonderland, and the director never makes the criminal case with any kind of enthusiasm. Val Kilmer has two problems - he's not as stalled as Holmes is (and no prosthesis this time, unlike Boogie Nights), and he's a lot prettier than Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not present a single nice guy among the cast. The racist and immature thieves with whom he leaves, or his wife, and the police are not much in the way of characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> All that said, anyone interested in the sloppy side of the porn industry in the 1980s or the real crime should not miss out.
