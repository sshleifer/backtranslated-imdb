I really liked this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey who knows Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is gone. She falls in love, but when spring comes, she gets the shock of her life when she is put down a step on her pedestal that Ben A has put on the scene. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsession that Ben has. He can not separate himself from what he loves most, it's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. Also, the people with whom he sits in baseball games are as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie and you will not get out if you rent this.
