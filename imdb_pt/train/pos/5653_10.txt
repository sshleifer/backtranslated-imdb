This was an absolutely fascinating series and regretted that I was only able to catch a few shows back when it aired late in the evening in the UK. The style was so different from the others of its kind, and the whole thing had a disconcerting air of stylish dread. All you have to do is read all the positive reviews (not a single negative I can see) to realize what a truly innovative series was and how it caught on in the imagination. I now understand from reading the comments that have been CANCELED, this is so unbelievable. What a bunch of loosened headless and overweight turkeys must have existed (or maybe still are) running to do that.
