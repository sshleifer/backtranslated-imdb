The beauty of the clear arch and the wonderful appeal are the main reason to watch this movie. "hula" is not up to the best clear movies, but still nice. she dances, she rides her horse and chases the man she loves. this movie is little more than an hour long and was directed by the future oscar winner, fleming victor (gone with the wind). the movie moves quickly and the clear arc has a lot of screen time. if you like clear, I would recommend "hula".
