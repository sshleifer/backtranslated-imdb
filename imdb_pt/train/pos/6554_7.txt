OK here's what I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was great. I'm a big fan of Nancy and I read all the original books from 1 to 56 and I kept reading more. Now I'm in 96. Watch out for the villains who give this movie a smaller footprint than it should have. All clues point to a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So, what is Nancy at the present time? She's still old-fashioned as she's in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books are complaining about Nancy's vision. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the scary movie. I loved the pursuits of exciting cars and I get aways. I loved the clues. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you go see it, since the people who are complaining do not know anything about what a good movie and B is about Nancy Drew. Go see that. It may not be Oscar-worthy, but it's really a good movie.
