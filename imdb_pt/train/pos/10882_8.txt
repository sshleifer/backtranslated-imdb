This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, which is the film within a film, the well-known actress running for her life in the first scene. This movie takes the old convention of a psychopath on it loose, and manages to do something new and interesting with it. It's also always good to see Molly Ringwald back into the attack. <br /> <br /> So this can be an example of what the genre has become. Cut hits all the marks and is really scary in some parts. I liked it. I gave it eight.
