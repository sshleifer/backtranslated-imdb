LOVE AT THE TOP - the American title completely wrong for the superb French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (meaning, I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is an original film, the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems to be all over amazing. This film was way ahead of its time; even by today's highest standards, it accomplishes things that look rich and new. Filmed by highly-underrated director Michel Deville, he defies description in the way he combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into a totally original mix - leaving to the end a big but subtle surprise to make it all before suddenly sad and more understandable. The cast is splendid, as is the writing and the theme. But it's Deville's delightful tone, keeping you unbalanced, but going crazy, which drives this "lost" movie to a very high level. (The written interview with the director in the "Special Features" section of the DVD is worth reading if you have time.)
