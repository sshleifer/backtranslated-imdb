Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top-notch cinema. This is a performance as good as it already has. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is as good a political thriller as they can get. There are no good guys or bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on people who think they are running it. Not only is Pacino's performance appealing - the compliment to the dead child's funeral is incredibly powerful - the film has a quick and sandy realism for him, which improves performances well without tricks. This great portrait of Big City politics also offers two hours of excellent viewing of non-violent movies, overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are more people. But they find themselves effectively without crossing the line. A movie like this restores my tired faith in Hollywood. I do not award many tens. This richly deserves it!
