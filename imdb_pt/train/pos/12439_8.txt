While the main story is supposed to happen in Morocco, this film was filmed in misty Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget. As broken as their cards may be, the actors and the team play them with remarkable skill and commitment, so that in the end I find the touching and graceful result. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers a formidable performance as the villain. The script and direction provide some gems. Whether you're going to like the movie or not, however, it will probably depend on your opinion of Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other critics pointed out Staden's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I find your interpretation lovely and very appropriate. Modesty can overcome the terrible difficulties through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same here.
