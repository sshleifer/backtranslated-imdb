I have to say that this was not very exciting, but talk about fashion and strange ways of solving a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... this is fantastic! I really liked that part of the movie ... Corky (Josh Flitter) is, however, extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) looked really hopeless ... he should have been more angry with her for how she treated him ... <br /> <br /> Alright, this movie is a tour and a fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teen espionage movies by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? She's getting good at this complicated detective job.
