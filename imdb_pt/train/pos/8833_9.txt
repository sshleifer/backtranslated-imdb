I was intrigued by the title, so during a little insomnia attack (fueled by my curiosity ...), I stayed up and watched. I checked my TV listings and watched again! There is a very obvious perception that occurred to me when I saw this movie - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are pretty much the same. The characters of Belgrade's children could have been transported to, say, somewhere in the American midwest for the same period of time, and language differences aside, it would be impossible to differentiate from any of the local teenagers of that era. They certainly exhibited the same growing pains and concerns, politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drink, sports, music ... In fact, the same things that occupied my time in Southern California in the 1970s <br /> <br /> This was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were also completely believable. I'm not going to say it was Yugoslavian American Graffiti, but I'll say it fits in nicely with other 50's themed films.
