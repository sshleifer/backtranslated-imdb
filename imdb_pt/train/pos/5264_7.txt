The film begins with him sitting at a coffee table at the door telling his friends about this beauty that takes his breath away. Suddenly he sees her a few feet away. he is so tired that his friends tease him and suggest "show her your bank book". But Hope claims that he can earn it in less than 30 days with "no" money! They bet polo ponies on the subject and they take all their money and ID's. Hope follows her, and when they are alone she swears a proposal she does not believe is sincere until she sings to her: "You do something to me," by Cole Porter. But she must leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can chase her. But when she sees him showing another girl through the city, disillusioned, she wants to let him fall. He continues to chase her and reaches out with her and her family on a race track, where he bets his few winnings in the last race, hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large numbers of synchronized dance, he loses the winning ticket and decides to marry him rich or poor. Then he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!
