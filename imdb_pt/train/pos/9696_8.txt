I'm not a fan of newer movies, but this was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children can watch together - how unusual! My aunt liked it too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always bearing in mind his resolve to find his friend, Marie. Highly recommended.
