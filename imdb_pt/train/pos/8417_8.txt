While the style of this film is not as discreet and realistic as a sound version would probably have been, this is still a very good movie. In fact, it was seen like an excellent film of its time, since it was nominated for the Oscar for best film (losing to WINGS). I still consider WINGS to be a top film, but this is excellent, despite a bit of influence from the leader, Emil Jannings. Jannings is a general of tsarist Russia who is living his last days. making a few dollars in the 1920s for being an extra Hollywood. His luck seems to have changed when he gets a phone call - to play an imperial Russian general fighting the communists during the revolution. Of course, this is not too exaggerated, but it also makes the old man think of the old times and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what happens next, I'll leave it to you, but it's a very good movie - particularly in the end. By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director. Although it was made in 1928, with the makeup he does not look much younger than in many of his later films.
