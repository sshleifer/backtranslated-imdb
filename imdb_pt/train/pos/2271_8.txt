I just heard the director's commentary for this movie, and I think the great thing I have with him is that this film, like Mann's, is completely subjective. It's from Howard's point of view. So any review or attempt to contemplate a set of comments on the subject, as Ebert did, is really about the character of Nolte, in fact. If you feel, like he did, that the movie "does not work," then you're saying, I think, that Howard does not work. And to be frank, you might be right. Howard's reasoning and personality would not really stand up to professional mental treatment and analysis. <br /> <br /> But, hey, this is the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
