If you are a fan of airplane type movies this is a must see! Set in the 1920s and 1930s, Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors but also great lines. "Tip the dat wall, tip the dat wall and tip the dat # @ $% # @ $ wall." "You should not hang me on a johnny hook" or "It sounds like Johnny's having sex". It's definitely a parody of old James Cagney Movies and makes many references. There's a great scene when Jhonnys is walking down Death Row and has a priest ready for his escape. Listen closely to the priests' false readings, it's very funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the pope. Watch your reaction to Johnny after he overthrows the Pope, much said without making a sound. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh or are old movie fans.
