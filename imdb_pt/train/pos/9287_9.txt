Several young Iranians dress as boys and try to enter a qualifying match for the World Cup between Iran and Bahrain. When they are caught, they are written in an area where the match remains within reach of the voice, but out of sight. Prisoners ask to be released, but rules are rules. Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy, and often hilarious. In 1997, The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian childhood and leaves the audience to know which one is "real". In 2000, in The Circle, several Iranian women leave the system; their transgressions are different, but all end up in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> However, thinking now of Offside, it is hard to imagine it as something other than a comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous. As women demand to know why they can not watch the football game and their captors struggle to respond, the only possible outcome is the comedy. What makes Offside most affecting is that young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply football fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose focus on the match and the historic victory that is within reach.
