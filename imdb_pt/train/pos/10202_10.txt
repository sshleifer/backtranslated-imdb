I personally enjoyed this movie and I'm alarmed at the rating that some people have given. It's a movie based on a comic book and it's animated, now if you do not like comics or animation, then of course you will not like this movie, so why did you watch it and bother to rate it is beyond of me. However, if you are a fan of interesting and strong characters and heroic (sexy) women kicking butt and saving the world (hell) you will love this movie. I thought the story really attracted me and it was a really cool movie. Enough anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. Meet, it's the live action version of Punisher. In the end, I highly recommend this movie to the comic book fan and super hero or someone with an open mind enough looking for a fun movie.
