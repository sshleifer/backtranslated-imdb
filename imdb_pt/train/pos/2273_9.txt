I still have to see a movie with Nolte that I did not like. However, having said that, he made many films and I saw only a few. In the eye of my mind I'm keeping the images of your performance here and that of "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of acting talents. When it is necessary to shout, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those that I value in actors: when he only makes facial, facial and body gestures, without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors in general has no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking, having no conscious appreciation of Keaton and Chaplin's domain, this generation of actors relies too much on the mechanical magic of computers. Of course it is also just a sign of the times in which we live. If Chaplin had lived in our times ... who knows, he might well have become a fan of computer graphics tools. <br /> <br /> I have not read Vonnegut's novel from which this movie comes to the screen. However, the plot is not so improbable or complicated that we can not follow the path outlined, even with all its surprises. Of course at first it seems absurd. However, this is also not impossible. Consider this to begin with: A spy in the heart of the Third Reich: the extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, America's most important spy in World War II by Delattre and Prichard (look at Amazon for more details ). Consider: Undercover History: Piercing the Reich: American Spies Inside Germany Nazi DVD (I've seen it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a production of History Channel . <br /> <br /> So the story is ridiculous? Much sought after yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. Nolte's character is recruited and takes on an incredibly dangerous mission, and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason to accept. It was a kind of passivity that he was sucked into this role as he says, because it was the best story he ever wrote and he got to play the part? This is a hard thing to imagine that any of us would understand. But it was an unusual moment and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The acting throughout the film throughout the cast is excellent and as people have pointed Alan Alan, always fantastic, is very good in a small role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked at the end of the movie (no - I will not ruin everything) and it made me feel terrible about the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was needed and that more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many pages burned? Hard to say, but it really shocks. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives one of the best performances you can expect .... the premises of the movie make you wonder about many things. It is very entertaining and provocative. What great movies should be. A bit long, but well worth it. By the way, the movie's music has selections from one of the best live composers: Arvo Part.
