Sensitive film has no brightness and to some extent a narrative structure, but is nevertheless superbly shot and executed. However, the point of the narrative structure is debatable. While giving the impression of tying loose ends in the final scenes, and connecting their thoughts to what can be described by the modern viewer as a "story," I am skeptical as to whether that feeling * needs a "narrative." structure "that is defined and detectable.Inevitably, it will be compared to SOMERSAULT because its central protagonist (I'm not sure if that is the right word!) It is a young and very young-looking woman whose newly discovered sexuality confuses and strengthens her - although, of course, Cate Shortland's film addresses that aspect better, but while there is the possibility that negligent viewers dismiss this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is somewhat more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Maybe it's where it does not arrive.It's certainly very different from Monahan's first feature - THE ENVIEW! I'm not sure how the Weaving and Lung sex scenes contributed to the story. imperfect character of the Weaving character - although I personally feel that this was achieved without the need of these scenes. <br /> <br /> JUST SEE THE MOVIE AGAIN ****** <br /> <br /> AND On a second display, I can see how some would dismiss it as a cellphone dressed as a feature. But I'm not sure how distinct these "categories" are, or even whether we should be making that distinction. Anyway, I think there are enough layers in the film to differentiate it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal, and its content is hardly challenging, at least in the way that SOMERSAULT, WHITE TONE, THREE DOLLARS, THE ILLUSTRATED DOCTOR OF THE FAMILY, WATCHED THE WAYS AND THE HUMAN TOUCH. The performances are all good but I came to the conclusion that the main reason I was enjoying the movie was because it fit the "Australian" genre, without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be reasonably good reason for someone else * DO NOT * like it! In fact, it was not until Lung entered the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film actually began to punch. But this leads us to another debate - should we * expect a movie to challenge us all the time? Surely I like being challenged by a movie (or a book, or other people), but there is more room for what is simply a cool story? <br /> <br /> I did not delete my initial post on this. film, because I am well aware of the Orwellian implications of such an act. But I would demote my initial rating from 8 to maybe 6.5. As for the nominations for the AFI Best Film, my votes go to the HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and they LOOK both ways - and I think LOOK Both ways must win.
