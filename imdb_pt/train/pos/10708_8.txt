John (Ben Chaplin) is a solitary bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from London. Although the Internet, it contacts a Russian bridal agency. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman - the guy can be lonely and shy, but he certainly has a good taste, does not he?) And when they met, he realizes she does not speak English. The communication between them is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the guy, just have some bizarre sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends visit her. So many surprises will happen. I liked this movie: first, it is almost impossible to be "labeled". Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller? I believe all choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is beautiful as usual, and I'm very curious about her: is she speaking Russian with a correct accent or pretending? Anyway, I found a nice movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Perfect Bait" ("The perfect bait")
