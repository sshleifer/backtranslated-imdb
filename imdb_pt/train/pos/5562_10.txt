This has funny jokes about all the Cheech and Chong movies. It's the first one I've seen with these guys. I thought it was very good. My dad really recommended me to get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLE OF PAPER, and my grandmother actually bought it for me, knowing what it was like. What a family I have. Well, this movie is very good and great for renting when you want to see a good classic. I should warn you, though, that's not funny. It has its moments, but it's not as funny as There's Something About Mary. Check it out anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you're an anti-drug activist or something.
