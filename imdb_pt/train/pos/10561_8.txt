089: Parade Footlight (1933) - released 9/30/1933, seen 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cream cone is invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we came to another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. This time around is the ultra-fast Footlight Parade, starring James Cagney as the stage producer, Chester Kent. I am 100% sure that Cagney was channeling Berkeley with his performance of irrepressible Kent, who has to create new ideas for presentations every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as the love interest of secretary who turned love. The Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell subplot is not so important this time, but not less enjoyable. One thing that intrigued me was Berkeley's own performances, which seemed too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, much less on a stage that would show a movie later. Obviously, Busby does not let a little thing like the story keep him from putting together the most exaggerated musical numbers he can imagine. I enjoyed almost all of this movie to the end, with the blatantly offensive number of "Shanghai Lil", which, as you can imagine, is as twisting as racially unpleasant performance. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six movies in three months. It has to be a new record. Anyway, this completes Warner Bros. musical trilogy of 1933, preceded by '42nd Street' and 'Gold Diggers of 1933'. I would definitely recommend watching all three in a row. I wonder if James Cagney was channeling Busby Berkeley while he was playing Chester Kent in this movie, or if the role as it was inspired by Busby. I hope it was; it seems to make sense that Berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences as Chester does. The funny thing about Cagney was that he did not really look like a leader in the traditional sense. He was 5'7 "tall and spoke with a strange New York accent, but the guy was quite versatile, ranging from the poisonous gangsters who made him so famous for the types of fast-talking producers we see here. , he was a protagonist in the body of a character actor. The rest of the cast has a few familiar faces, Joan Blondell returns and pretty much steals the show as Cagney's loyal secretary Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler the cute couple but seems to have less Billy Barty appears again as the mischievous pillow.The movie is typical of the more daring and adult musicals of the pre-Code era, as opposed to those of the 1950s and 60s that were more family oriented, and is an excellent climax to Warner's musicals of that year (the number of "Shanghai Lil" did not stand up, with Keeler doing a lousy job with the Chinese look). <br /> <br /> Latest movie: Dinner At Eight (1933) movie: I'm No Angel (1 933).
