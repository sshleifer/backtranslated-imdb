This wonderful 1983 BBC television production (not a movie, as others have written here) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre," starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the best version ever made today, since it is the most faithful to the romance of Charlotte Bronte in the concept as much in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when filmmakers begin to meddle with the lifeblood of a classic, this classic is destroyed. Luckily the producers of this "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and fidelity to the original, resulting in a spectacularly addictive mix that is worth several times to appreciate its multiple layers of sweetness and delight and suspense. The presentations are delicious, the music is perfect, even the gothic design of the house and outdoor photos are beautiful, and set the right tone for production. My only criticism, though slight, is that this version, like all versions of Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but to stay with Rochester after discovering that he had an insane wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just divorced," she would tell her man, or she would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew she could not settle for this course in life and respect herself. Because? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had learned from childhood, not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood institution, but from the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred rather than turned away. Someday I would like to see some version depicting these influences in a slightly more complete way in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "Even so, come Lord Jesus!" it must not have the foundations of that faith drawn from it.
