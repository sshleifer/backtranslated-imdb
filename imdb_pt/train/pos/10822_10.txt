I was fortunate enough to be able to see this film many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies ever since, but I've never forgotten this one. Although Sinatra was playing a not very affectionate character, he was excellent at the role. Many people seem to think he did not really come into his own until his role in "From Here to Eternity," but in my opinion, he was magnificent in Concho. The other role that stands in my mind is that of William Conrad. I've never seen or heard of him before this movie. Conrad plays a fantastic role in this movie. I remember his deep, deep voice and he uses it wonderfully to highlight the few words he speaks with a threat that sets the tone of his character. I also remember the song that both presents and Conrad and it seems to surround him whenever he appears. An excellent film and my only disappointment was that I never got a chance to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the headlines that the film is in black and white, but when I saw it was really colorful, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
