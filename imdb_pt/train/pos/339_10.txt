I read Schneebaum's book (the very title of this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many modes of "otherness" (his own and the Amazonian people with whom he lived and loved ) a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not so powerful, but they showed his continued pursuit. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was far ahead of his time in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness on the subject were welcome. This film beautifully conveys both man's strangeness and generosity, but also provides a glimpse of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude into traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself moved into a kind of superior innocence that suggests the possibility of saving mankind from its own destructiveness.
