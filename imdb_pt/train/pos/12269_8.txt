Four macho guys and three sexy girls venture into a remote area to hunt a bear. The heterogeneous group comes into conflict with the deranged Vietnam veteran Jesse (a really scary picture of Alberto Mejia Baron), not surprisingly not being kind to strangers invading their terrain. Director / co-writer Pedro Galindo III reports the exciting story at a steady pace, creates a good dose of nervous tension, and offers a good amount of blood with the brutal pieces of the murder (a nasty cut in the throat and a hand being ripped out with a shotgun rate like the final horrible splashes). The capable cast gives solid performances, with especially praiseworthy works by Pedro Fernandez as the nice and human Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as lively Alejandra, Charly Valentino as the nice Charly, and Tono Mauri as the antagonistic psychopath Mauricio. Better yet, the hot blonde Marisol Santacruz and the lovely brunette Adriana Vega provide a tasty eye drop, wearing tiny swimsuits. Antonio de Anda's lean and agile cinematography, breathtaking wilderness, Pedro Plascencia's robust, raucous and rapturous sound, well-developed characters and a pleasant 76-minute running time further enhance the winning sound quality of horror / action hybrid.
