Who does not know Largo Winch in the trio France-Belgium-Luxembourg (the three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, had to be adapted on the screens. After a first - and failed - attempt of a TV show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and this is what most fans did not understand, the purpose of this film is not strictly to adapt the series of comic books. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a first-class fan of the comic book, I must confess that I was very surprised. The actors are good, so it's the scenery, although it may seem very fast. So, I recommend this movie to all those interested in financial / political thrillers, but it's clearly not an alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series as I could read over the internet.
