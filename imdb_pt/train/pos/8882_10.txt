John Singleton's best film, before aspiring blockbusters as the remake of Shaft, is a thought-provoking film with great performance and excellent balance between the three main characters in the story, each with identifiable juvenile problems. What I liked most was that it also covers the problem of self-pity among young blacks, a problem largely ignored by the media and other films that focus mainly on socio-economic problems and racism of whites . This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The most masterful thing about this movie is that it deals with so many topics without getting superficial. It is not just about racism, but about how difficult it can be to adopt a new world (faculty), rape encounters, discover sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson all perform terrific performances, and the support cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a leah (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums causing minor riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the caricature of a teacher of Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Of course, many teachers are crazy. But they are not so flat. The skinheads are also a bit caricatured, but I think they're just like that in real life. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great work underrated movie, if you liked American History X, you'll love this one. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
