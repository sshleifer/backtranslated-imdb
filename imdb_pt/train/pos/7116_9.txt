No one would say that this 1945 war movie was a masterpiece. (How could any war movie of 1945 be a masterpiece?) And yet it is an extremely effective story of a real story by Al Schmidt, blinded in Guadalcanal, played by John Garfield, who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person's actions. Robert Leckie, in "Helmet for My Pillow," denigrates Schmidt's popularity in favor of his deadly trenchmate, writing that "the country must have needed living heroes." <br /> <br /> Well, I suppose the country has. And they had one here. There is a single combat scene in the movie, attached to the studio, lasting only ten minutes, and occurring less than halfway through the movie, instead of being saved to climax, but it is the most frightening and realistic depiction of men. under fire that I remember seeing on screen, including those in "Saving Private Ryan." Men scream in fear, scream at one another and at the enemy, bleed and die, without the aid of color, stereophonic sound, aberrations, or blood. <br /> <br /> Simply from the technological point of view, the film is excellent. It is not only that we learn how complicated a Browning machine gun caliber machine is the 30 gauge water, or that it should be fired in bursts of just a few rounds, or that is not waved like a fire. hose, as in so many other war films. Technical precision increases the riveting quality of the scene. The need for short bursts is terrifying when dozens of enemies are sneaking down a stream fifteen yards away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun station. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not brave, including the ubiquitous support of the 1940s, John Ridgeley, and a radiant, young Eleanor Parker. The framed love story is free, but it works and, ultimately, it's quite exciting. An impressive sequence of dreams is included. It's not Bunuel, but for a routine 1945 film, it stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script, or it may have been altered by someone else. He could have used the kind of pruning that could have introduced some much-needed ambiguity. Still, there are strange verbal scores that make a startling impact on the viewer: "Why does not God kill me?" And, "In the eyes, Lee. Put them in the eyes!" Depths of anguish in some cheesy words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by veterans injured in a 1945 war movie. <br /> <br /> Note that it may seem false to a contemporary viewer, but perhaps should not: the dated vernacular, which is hard to believe many of today's children might think that it was actually spoken - "private gab", "drug." "" dripping, "" Gee, "" your idiot, "" lady, "" an incredible guy, "and" feeling sorry for yourself. "Let's consider the historical context and be courteous in our judgments. idiot jargon was at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Real Weaknesses? Wounded veterans gather and argue about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is over-solved with a conclusion like, "Just because you have a silver plate on your head does not mean that people think you are a bad person. "Sometimes there are silent voice-overs and silent prayers that are unnecessary and downright unimaginable." Please God, let him come back to me "and that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, the filmmakers were operating within the constraints of their times.Maybe that's why the final fading is in an Independence Hall scene and the inspiring chords of" America the Beautiful "swell in the back. <br /> <br /> None of this can undo the virtues of the film, which are considerable, particularly the impact of that gruesome combat scene. It is not on television that many times. If you have a chance, by all means catch this.
