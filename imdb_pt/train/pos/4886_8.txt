The last of the Blond bombshell is a bit of fun. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a recently widowed woman in loose ends. She spent most of her life being the obedient wife and mother, but she was never truly happy. <br /> <br /> Soon after the funeral of her husband, Elizabeth is having her regular lunch with her dick-in-the-mud kids when she sees a street performer. It sparks memories of when she was a member of a swinging female band in London during World War II. We soon learned that the band was not exactly every girl, since the drummer was a man getting dressed as a winged woman. Like Like It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth takes her sax (which she has secretly practiced during the wedding). ) and joins forces with the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist, and the money starts flowing. She does not accept money because she is rich and does not need it. His performance is strictly for artistic achievement. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm), who was the band's drummer. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - the women's man, and Elizabeth - only fifteen at the time - was the only member of the band who did not experience Patrick's "talents" beyond the drums. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to reconvene the old group to play at the granddaughter's dance school. So begins a delightful journey down the memory road, combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all culminating with some good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I think I'm at the age where I really like older actresses doing their thing, and this movie is a treasure because not only is it starring Judi Dench, but she's supported by none other than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and a series of experienced British character actresses. All this is complemented by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fluff, but totally enjoyable and extremely fun.
