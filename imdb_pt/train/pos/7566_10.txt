The girl's name is Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently living a decent life but is suddenly inexplicably torn from her home and life by Evil Dude and the Diverse and Diverse Adepts. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on, except that a bunch of people armed with their teeth apparently want her dead ... and she's going to die without even knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I hear whining all the time. Now that content is so cheap to be produced and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be no one to ensure there is a quality standard! We're going to drown in crap! The only people who really think they are people who have not seen a movie or read any book recently - because we're already making an allegorical car of a dead man. There are guys like Ferrari and Rodriguez who put the lie to these ignorant fulminants throwing $ 8K at the table and doing ... well, what I would say is a better action movie than anything you've seen in theaters. year ... but you have not seen any action movies in the movies this year. I saw the box office. You will stay away in droves. You'd better get a copy of it, spend twenty minutes entertained, and go on with your lives. <br /> <br /> It's pure fun. You enter, like Bonnie, with lots of questions and where the whole thing turns out to be nebulous. The whole concept was done before in various ways, but not in such a large amount of time, and not without such a concentrated and tasty shooting. You are there for the atmosphere, the mystery and the weapons. That's it - that's all the filmmakers promise, and they deliver. <br /> <br /> It warms the black holes of my heart by thinking that this was done with such a budget. We've spent quite a few indie movies around here, but we rarely see anything as polished as this one, and we've never seen one done in the action genre that looked so good. Hell, you could deliver these two guys MI: 3 and that could make me watch. The Bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, actually, even better: I'd like to see these guys making a movie on their own and staying away from Hollywood. Whatever is out there killing the film industry is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> The best indie we've seen in a while and the most effective indie calling card we've ever seen. The DVD costs $ 20 and has extra bonuses. Go get your movie budget and put it to that.
