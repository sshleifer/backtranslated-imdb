A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as secretary, trying to save his boss from the electric chair while tracing a mysterious "ghost" woman and Franchot Tone as a mad and killer sculptor. In addition, there are some minor and fascinating parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drummer junkie, as well as the other characters that make up the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in healthier parts, she's allowed to exaggerate here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different, and although not a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is very artificial, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
