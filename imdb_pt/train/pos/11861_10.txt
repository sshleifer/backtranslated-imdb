This movie is great fun and never boring, even running in almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the movie and are very believable. The violence was a little extreme in the film, but then showed how drug-dealing was violent at the time of the film. The ending is incredible and is probably one of the coolest scenes of all time. Great movie and you'll probably have fun.
