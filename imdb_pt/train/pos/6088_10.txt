Was the script more appropriate for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they still make it work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an insipid script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board really seem to hate this movie. I personally can not see how this could be, but Envy is just one of those movies that you love or hate. Much like Napoleon Dynamite and all the Leslie Neilsen films already made. You think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this movie because of the comments. Watch and see if you're one you really like! If you do, I assure you it's worth your money. If you do not like ... well, now you know.
