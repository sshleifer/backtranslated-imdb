First, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone brings back a cult movie genre and adapts it to the present, something gets inexplicably lost in the translation. This is not the case here. This movie starts on the right path. It is part of the familiar territory, but also can surpass the top. Crockzilla dinner anyone? This has to be seen, and just try to keep a straight face. This movie takes some of the classics of cult cult fun and manages to blend it perfectly into a modern production. It is good to see that someone is filling the need in this market. Well done. <br /> <br />
