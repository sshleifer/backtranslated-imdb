I've wanted to see the cut since the day I heard of it, which was sometime last year. Anyway I have to see it today, and when the movie started I thought it started instead of week, but it got better after 10 minutes or so. I thought the movie was very good. but the thing I did not like was how the killer was created, I was thinking before I rented it would probably suck like Urban Legends: Final Cut, I almost died. mainly everything in the UL final cut needed to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give a cut to 8 of 10
