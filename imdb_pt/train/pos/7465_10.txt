Warning: Contains no spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet and plan to do it, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times so far and have not yet decided on what exactly happened in the movie. That's all I'm going to say, because if you have not seen this movie, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading then I will ask you some questions and maybe if anyone has any reply you can email me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my Grade 11 English teacher very well. Her name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this indirect way of teaching things you might not like very much. If we did not like Shakespeare, he would turn the story into a modern novel with modern language so we could understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book in our own leisure time. This was his indelible way of marking something in our sponge-like minds. <br /> <br /> I start this Vanilla Sky review with a description of this brilliant man because he gave us a task that was firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a friend long lost, and finally , made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now, if I had not known better, I would have thought the Wachowski brothers were really only a pseudonym of Professor Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, let's assume it was not him. But this was the first time that this attribution was more than impalpable. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him and ourselves that they were real. Show me how you can say you're real. This caused the class to let go of all the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, sensation of touch to sensation of loss of feeling of hunger, was sent to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After every scenario we gave him, he would come back with the only answer that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if you're nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What a confusing question this is. This was a question / scenario that was proposed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid advancement of computers. How possible could it seem at that time? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what you were part of someone else's dream. Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky is deeper than any other movie could expect. In short, this is a movie that will literally (if you allow) shake your mind of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot, fair, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father, and although he has talent and business knowledge, his board of directors, the Seven Dwarfs, thinks he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing to merit the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we meet one of David's beautiful toys, Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie make a good game, both claiming they are there just to use each other and are not at all interested in a monogamous and committed relationship. This is the kind of relationship compatible with David's other attacks that he had at the sexual height of his life. And although both speak a good game, we can say that only one is actually telling the truth. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by good friend Kevin Smith, Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David will publish, but they are also very good friends . This is something that David has very little in his life and you can feel a real affection for each other at the beginning of the movie. Brian has a famous phrase that he continues to tell David again and again. And this is "the sweet is not so sweet without the bitter". He continues to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part-time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all the floozies that inhabit his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> At David's big birthday party (so big that Steven Spielberg wishes him a happy birthday) Brian comes in with his girlfriend, Sofia Sorrano, played by Penelope Cruz with what should be the best performance this year of an actress. . This is an invitation-only party and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with each other. And in typical David fashion, though his best friend is there, he starts flirting with Sofia. To complicate matters, Julie appears uninvited and begins to spy on David. David spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw cartoons of each other. There is no scarf. The next day, when David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there ....... well, I think we've all seen the commercials. <br /> <br /> That's all I'm going to say about the plot, because from here the movie provokes us with what is reality and with what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other obscure characters who are part of this mist maze. There is a subtext of death and possible cure-all as a panacea that may or may not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the film offers us, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> As many movies seem to thrive today, this movie has a secret. Sixth Sense may have started this craze but look even further back and you may perhaps thank Angel Heart for starting the craze. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of its own undergoing bust busters. And what makes it so fun is that the movie gives you lots of obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the challenge of the truth and lies that you just went through. I've seen this movie four times and every time it was because I want to see if there's anything else I can get, something else I can understand. Being able to work your mind in the theater, to allow it to open up to new possibilities, is something rare in a movie. All ersatz called "The best photos of the year" were good, but nothing spectacular. They have no substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing, but flat. The Royal Tenenbaums were interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that makes you anxious for more yet ensures your satisfaction because the film and those who did care about it. I know this movie received mixed reviews, but I think those who do not like it do not quite understand. <br /> <br /> That's how cinema is made. That's what a movie should do to you. It's supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year were just empty spaces. This is not. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 The best movie of the year. I would love to see this being nominated for Best Picture and I would love to see Cruz for Best Actress, Diaz for Best Support, Cruise for Best Actor, and Jason Mewes to be Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe should be there as well. None of this can happen, and that's a shame. This is a movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And on a final note, I'm sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the only film that can answer your question. Can you prove it to be real? Or are we just an invention of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for the fun of another person? This is a movie that raises more questions than answers. And I'm sure it's okay with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
