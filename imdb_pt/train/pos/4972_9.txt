LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt I'll see a better movie this year. This beautiful tragicomedy of Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage takes place in the industrial lands of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to get a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this, the child has to break the opening doors of the registry. What the father really wants is for his son to be someone because he never went further as a local news reporter for a newspaper ironically called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This movie may be better compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and humor is more somber. Just like in the movie, however, the tone is more melancholic than depressing and optimistic ending, without being unrealistically happy. The humor is absurd, without making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in the dark settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the performance of Poelvoorde. This actor gained fame with the also brilliant cult-classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRÉS DE CHEZ VOUS, in which he played the charismatic assassin Ben. Since then, he has only done two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting skills and all the roles he was offered were the character's surprises Ben. With his return to a leading role in the LCA, there should be no more doubts about his role. He is simply brilliant as a stupid man and barely enough to put his family in misery, but clever enough to realize what he has done and be torn by remorse about it. A must see.
