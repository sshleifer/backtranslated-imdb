The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing's studies did so well in the 1940s and 1950s. His story follows a man who invents a cloth that does not get dirty or break. Of course, this is a major breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, things are not as simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people including fabric manufacturers, the fabric factory workforce, and even a lady who washes every week. The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances and the way they do not always help; as the old woman says at one point in the movie, "Why do not you scientists leave things alone?" Like many Ealing comedies, this one is starring Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and he does in this movie, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a realistic and credible way. He is adequately scary in this film, and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious scientist, but a little naive. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood, the deep voice actress who co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would get the role of Alfred in the Batman movies. The acting in the film is not always great, but it is always decent, and fits with the film. <br /> <br /> The man in white suit is an intelligent, thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious, and does not always work, but the movie is not meant to be a laughing movie, so it's forgivable. I recommend this movie basically for anyone who is a fan of movies.
