"Life hits us in the face ........ we should try to look beautiful". Movie premiere of one of the best Belgian artists (he sings songs), Tom Barman. A long awaited film and happy joy of joy for the Flemish cinema, really worth watching, and a promising job! It takes us to the lives of 8 main characters who live on a Friday and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float like they do at the Friday night party where they meet. <br /> <br /> The rhythmic style is very 'thought'. Excellent use of music. Sometimes you take your hand to the pictures and you feel their power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience because it is the way it is filmed. He really keeps you with it while he's in a small place with lots of people having a big party ... so hard to film. <br /> <br /> Thank you menij√®r Barman for making this daring film in these, a few years ago, poor times of Flemish footage. You made my day!
