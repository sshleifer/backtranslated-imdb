With Harry Callahan getting up in years, the inevitable story of the "old man with a chip on his shoulder" eventually had to come on the scene. Callahan, looking fragile at times and out of place, his behavior was still unshakeable. Luckily, this movie took some time to develop a different kind of storyline, which could reinvent Dirty Harry and the whole genre. Although the film failed to do so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even though it was getting a bit out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.
