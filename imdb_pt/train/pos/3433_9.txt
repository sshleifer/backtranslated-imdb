I saw this at a foreign film festival. It is a beautiful biscuit of a plan to relieve the Estonian treasure of a billion or more gold. It's all filmed in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses - but captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully (note: Tallinn was looking a lot less gloomy in 2003 when I was there). There's a lot of humor and some romance too. I do not want to ruin a series of surprising but logical surprises, so I'm just going to say that this assault movie starts with a great script, and the direction and performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most desperate example of its kind - I put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and it's miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, although (deliberately) it's not so bright. Rent or buy now.
