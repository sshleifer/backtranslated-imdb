Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies that you hate and think about suicide as the next best thing to do, instead of having to keep an eye on it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a hit, one of those movies in which the mood, plot, acting, is actually very hidden, but for those of us willing to look for it, trusting the director well, the reward is: U laughs your A .. from !! The fact that you have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even funnier because you have the impression that the director is not even aware of how funny your movie is, which does not seem likely and there is the intelligence in charge of this magnificent project called: Spaced Invaders !!
