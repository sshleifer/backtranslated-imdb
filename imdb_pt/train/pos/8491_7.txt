I saw this movie when it was new. I later rented it in Japan after being here for three years, afraid to shiver when I saw it in the light of my international experience. The film pleasantly surprised me with the precision with which it depicts the cultural clash between Japan and Pennsylvania (from where I am). Not all things are factually in sight, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film for its impartial treatment on both sides. in history. Curiously, while Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialogue is redoubled in the Japanese version to cover up obvious problems of second-language delivery. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. . I think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with Japan by watching this movie than by reading any of the "serious" books on the subject (most of which were written in the 1980s and funded by Japanese advertising companies) . Do not be fooled by the drag in the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who, among other things, found it implausible that the Japanese wanted to build cars in the US. (Of course the Japanese operate many factories there to stay close to customers and avoid trade friction.) This is a very hot and funny movie that I would rate higher if it were not for some 80's cliches like dancing around music electronic cheese disc. Michael Keaton has never been more funny.
