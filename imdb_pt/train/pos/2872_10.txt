In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic masterpiece from Disney. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly devilish. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of cleaning, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful woman. For me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before ending, I would like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece for all of you who have not seen it yet. You're in a good mood, so go to the rental store, rent it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch.
