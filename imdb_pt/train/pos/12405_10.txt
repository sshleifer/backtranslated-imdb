I captured this movie around 1990 in video by accident and without knowing what I was doing. Many horror fans may have lost this thought that it was a typical prison film and those who succeeded did not like it, as that was not what they wanted to see. The above mentioned factors are probably the reasons why it is low, but just ignore it and take a spin if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> It has strong features in all departments, from script and atmosphere. to act and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a movie that I still have in video until today. Check out.
