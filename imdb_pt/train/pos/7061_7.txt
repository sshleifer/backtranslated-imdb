Of course, the original is better, but this is not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it's done in 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was very good to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, it shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> I also liked Cinderella's voice. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I think it sounds better here, cooler. I liked her personality too, she had more than one backbone, but she was still gentle. <br /> <br /> So, I'm going to give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True to 7/10.
