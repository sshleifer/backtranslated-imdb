Alain Chabat is an excellent actor, writer and director, but perhaps a little misdirected to give a credit 'idea' for a story that probably made them roll in the hallways when Aristophanes was still learning that it is 'me' before 'and' , Except after 'c'. But as I said, Chabat is a good actor and he can make charm when he needs it. I'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg, which also turns into a performance performed. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the "plot" is that about the guy in his forties and more than the content to be single. This does not fit well with the mother and the five sisters and, to get them off the back, makes an "arrangement" with a colleague's sister to pose - for fifteen thousand euros - as their new girlfriend, allow the romance to reach fruition with a wedding, and then jilt it, thus, taking it off the hook. Of course, they end up together, but along the way there are some sub-Benedek and Beatrice dueling and all things considered to be a painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the French box office that a sequence may not be out of the question.
