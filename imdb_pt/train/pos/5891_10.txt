ITALIANO is a surprisingly accomplished film for its time. Stunningly shot, with lighting effects that are truly sublime, this is a precious gem that clearly reveals REGINALD BARKER to be a pioneer equal director for D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince has exercised over production is difficult to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is very touching. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today. The use of close-ups is great and GEORGE BEBAN's performance is electrifying. What we need now is a really good impression transferred to the DVD so that we can truly enjoy this masterpiece of cinema.
