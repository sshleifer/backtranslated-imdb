I really enjoyed Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just have to let this happen and enjoy it while it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting on a cafe-terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and watching people go by. This definitely will not make you think later, it's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just the experience during the movie that is great. <br /> <br /> I felt that there were some strands that could have been worked out a bit more, but being a Lynch fan I do not care much more :) <br /> <br /> And I * loved * style or style of this movie. It's smooth, but cool, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will take their AWTWB kicks, I can guarantee you. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10 music)
