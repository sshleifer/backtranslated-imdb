OK - you want to test someone about how comfortable they are with your teenage years and the embarrassing and maniacal changes in it - then get your immediate reaction from watching this noisy documentary about children making socially relevant horror movies in the suburban 80's. More than any movie I've ever seen, the film tries to overload sexuality and ego in a completely human way, never bored and blushing in the kind of goodness inherent in youth that is discolored by the frenzied adult world of fear where any whim in youth it is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion. Mini-Mongolian Darren Stien seems to be seeking a deeper understanding of his triumphs and apprehensions as the patriarch of the rigorous children's world. What he finds in himself and in others is not always handsome - but it shows how one can improve and reconcile with age. What changes means without reflection. I love this movie.
