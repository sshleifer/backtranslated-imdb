This is the best film made for TV of all time! Am I saying that because I'm a big fan of Silverstone? Partially, but even without her, I would still see. I'm a fan of films of the serial killer genre, and I think this is a great entry into this category. In addition, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alice's top five character creations. Totally memorable - as if she really existed. I would have her on my side as well, if there was a mystery to be solved. She interprets the character, as she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. It looks sweet, honest, cool ... just like it is in real life. So this is acting? Yes, in fact, she's kind of a rebel once again. This time she is not bad, she is very good and is a little afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she does not do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective magazines and solves crimes. A clich√© is plentiful: she is kind of avenging her father's death, in a different way than the watchful style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, fatherless, lonely. It happens here, too, but she's a little nerdy this time around. Does not matter; she's still cool as a nerd. Check this out soon, or else Giordano will be investigating why you do not ...
