The Secret of Kells is one of the most original, beautiful and breathtaking animated films I have ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was convinced that nothing could give up your money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious competitor. <br /> <br /> Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the abbot of Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a little too severe and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the city of an attack by the Vikings than in nourishing the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly with Willie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wings, Brendan goes into a forest and meets a lovely forest nymph named Aisling who likes her (and saves her life). one more time). With Aisling's help, he tries to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book that, according to legend, can turn darkness into light.
