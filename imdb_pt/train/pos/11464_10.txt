What is most disturbing about this movie is not that the school murder series like the one described actually happen, but the truth is they are performed by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal kids with normal families. Using a portable hand-held camera technique, Ben Coccio manages to bring us into the lives of two friends who have some problems in high school, though we are never told exactly what lies behind these problems. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? A part of you simply does not believe they will carry out the mass murderer very well thought out on Zero Day. Scenes from the surveillance camera at school during the shooting are even more powerful for that reason. You can not believe this is really happening and that this really happened. The hand-camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted film, a brilliant idea given the question.
