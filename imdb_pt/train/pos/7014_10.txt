Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is very attuned to the wide range of human emotions. This film was cleverly and very well done. It is rare to find such an intense humanity today in Hollywood. I would compare this with "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" as much as the show of light and darkness in such a crude way. It definitely stays with you for a long time and gives you plenty to think about. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this. It is not usually one for a "bad end", but rather a seeker of truth that embraces emotion, raw life and something more than the superficiality that exists in abundance everywhere. So I do not mind a little pain in the end. It is true for life that there are not always happy endings. Sometimes it's not just the happy ending that you think you should be. Many people have been able to live happy lives even though one's love and life have been lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
