Full House is a great family show. However, after watching a few episodes over and over, I realized that they are incredibly annoying and seem to protect themselves a lot from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly tacky. It's not like I hate it, but it just does not watch them over and over again, because they get old quickly. Probably the best season is the first. Full House is about widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. Then his best friend, Joey (Dave Coulier) and Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), of the girls, will move in with them. Once they live there together, they think they can not live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you how important the family is and that you can always return home.
