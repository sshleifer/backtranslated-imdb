I really liked this little movie. It is a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the young actor who plays Miki is especially good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films around World War II that this compellingly told story is a real break with the norm, and an original one. I will also add that this film is far from boring, far away !! Of course the Horses are wonderful and the scenery is breathtaking. For those who really treat your animal as part of the family (I do), you will find this film especially rewarding. Recommended for movie fans looking for something a little different.
