The comparison with Sleuth, the first play that turned into a movie, is obvious, and in my first performance I also thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, far more repeated views than Sleuth. > I bought Deathrap in the Wal-Mart bin, imagining that there was Caine and underestimated Reeve and it was worth the $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could have chosen. <br /> <br /> It's one of those best-kept secrets that movie fans are always always thrilled to discover. And it's totally worth repeating the exhibits. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine acted bravely in Sleuth, I was doubly impressed by Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, legitimately associated with his legendary portrait of Superman, stole the show in what should have been an Oscar-worthy performance. I always felt that Reeve was a kind of actor who did not stand a chance to shine out of Superman's movies and some other bad but fun movies like Somewhere in Time but this movie shows that his potential was truly hit and put into use, thank God. <br /> <br /> I absolutely enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine. He was superficial, deliciously manipulative, and sadistic. And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this movie that I got into a "Michael Caine stage" and started renting as much of my stuff as possible. <br /> <br /> As for Deathtrap, there is enough juicy dialogue here to fill in the "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue would inherently ruin the immensely entertaining plot). It's actually very difficult to talk about the movie without ruining important plot points that are infinitely more fun to figure out on your own. Needless to say, it is a must see. But to me, it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated views are a must. <br /> <br /> And he deserves to sit next to Sleuth on the shelf of his DVD. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this quote from the movie: "I wonder if that would not happen. be ... well ... just a little starry-eyed at me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration ... where I could not count on any sense of moral obligation ... whatever.
