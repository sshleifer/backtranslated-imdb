That's what one of the girls said in the end. <br /> <br /> Is the football game a metaphor for a qualifying game between girls (or, more broadly, a free-thinking group) and authority? "For Germany" means for a future that is hopeful? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most unforgettable film experiences I've ever had - despite raw cinematography and plot, and mild super-action (although I like the cast - they're adorable and well above expectations for amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the deep frustration being denied a game (being a woman and a football fan) and I can not stop thinking about how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is no female section where protection against foul language and misbehavior can be provided - defeating the failed reasons for denial. <br /> <br /> The film is done very cleverly - the incredible title, the filming during the game, the spontaneity and various methods to put the spectators in the place of the characters - the game that is so important but inaccessible (not shown), the light of attraction and the sound of the stadium, the confinement of the van, and the futility of it when those within connect with the celebrating crowds outside. I can feel the comfort coming from the radio, the drinks and the food, and of course from the kindness and consideration of each character to the others. During the final credits, I have fun that no character has a name - he's just a "soldier" and she's just a "girl" or "sister."
