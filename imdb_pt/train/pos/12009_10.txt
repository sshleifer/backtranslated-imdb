I really thought they did a * great * job, there was nothing wrong with this, I do not know how the first commentator could have said it was terrible, it got me to tears (I think this changed everyone for the tears) but I try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing, but this one got me. It was so good! I hope they release it on DVD, because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel like this has renewed my faith and given me a hope that I can not explain, it made me want to strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we kind of took that for granted, I guess. Compared to this, I feel that our own trials are nothing. Well, it's nothing, but it hardly matches what they had to go through. I loved. Who played Emma?!
