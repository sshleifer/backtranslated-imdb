Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but they are never less than interesting. "Insignificance" is obviously, first of all, an adapted staging: it is word and very "attached to the room". BUT, it's worth watching this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not overtly presented and it also takes time to adjust to the juxtaposition and reversals of roles of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio . <br /> <br /> Einstein is ruined by guilt over Hiroshima, but imagines the simplicity of a sexual connection with Munro; Munro is tired of being seen as a bimbo and yearns for intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting powers, but he is an impotent fool; DiMaggio is unsure about his celebrity, self-obsessed and prone to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. Each character has a troubled, abused / abusive past and a questionable future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with its cultural icons and postwar customs; the obsessions of the protagonists for something that nobody can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. In comparison to the theory of relativity, a proposed unified field theory and indeed the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. However, these aspects of the physical universe (it's all quantum, trust me!) Affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without quoting it as such) is not an anachronism in itself, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. In fact, ALL the references within the script are accessible only to an experienced viewer: one with the occurrences of the 1950s / personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script are either very, very intelligent, or extremely opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, however, it is probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> Live long and thrive :) <br /> <br />
