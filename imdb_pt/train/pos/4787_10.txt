David Lynch usually makes movies that resemble the puzzle together in the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think of, but they do not really gel in your mind. Maybe art always means more to its creator. <br /> <br /> Hetero Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey for rural America. A Real-Life Journey Alvin Straight picked up a lawn mower to get to his brothers' home. He traveled 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make up with his sick brother for past crimes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this movie is the sweet Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin straight to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow-paced coincides with Alvin's slow journey toward achievement. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin finds a confused and frightened young woman. She is pregnant and has decided to flee her situation. After hearing Alvin talk about family, she reconsiders. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin witnesses a disturbed woman killing a deer with her car. She complains that she killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad, but he's smart enough to make some sweet meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later on, Alvin's lawnmower loses its brakes and almost kills him. A good man and his wife let him stay in the yard while he repairs. They even let him call her sweet but slow daughter, very well played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to take Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with gratitude. While Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of the war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper who always haunted him. <br /> <br /> Alvin also finds two quarreling brothers who have mended their lawn mower. He speaks them in the price wisely, calling them their high labor costs and repairs. He even helps them to appreciate each other by learning from their own mistakes. <br /> <br /> The night before, Alvin leaves the man's yard and takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor to have him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It's sincere because it's so direct, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can not help getting more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was incredible. You can not help but understand your pride, listen to your wisdom, and finally feel your pain. One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his yard to stay. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth are sitting together in a bar. I can imagine them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the movie, "My brother and I used to look at the stars." Well, I know they all have the best view of the house.
