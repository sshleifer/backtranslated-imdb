How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious ancient series; I was glad to see old Lugosi. It's disarmingly friendly and lively. It is the document of a long lost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these moderately good old series.) CHANDU is deep, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. It is not idiotic; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. Without giving much, Chandu is a Western sorcerer who also goes by that Oriental name and who also loves and protects his Seitan niece of murderers. <br /> <br /> Chandu exercises his supernatural gifts in a discreet and moderate manner. <br /> <br /> As for the very sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by Ubasti's priest. : the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is actually multiplied kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent sleeping with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a false police officer; the temple of Lemuria and its strange and frightening ceremonies resemble the images of KING KONG and are a barbaric mockery of RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu? Lugosi looked like a libidinous old man half-hearted, half-drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. He is the average drunken, prototypical uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This may sound like a somewhat dishonest tribute to Lugosi, though Burton's Woody's biopic gave me that impression about Lugosi and allied with her a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I like Lugosi's extravagant performances. <br /> <br /> This series is unfairly destroyed.
