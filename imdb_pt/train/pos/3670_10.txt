I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and as I'm about to study cinema in Canada from everywhere, I'll certainly bring it to class. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around the probably most unlucky film crew in the history of the movie itself, is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every joke in time. <br /> <br /> If you just could not laugh during "North Hollywood" I suggest you consult a psychiatrist immediately - you may have serious problems. Besides the wonderful script, I also noticed the great chemistry between the actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where are they really acting? Jennifer Tilly (playing a hilarious actress) and Martin Landau, also performed a very daring but funny performance. <br /> <br /> Great movie, best cast.
