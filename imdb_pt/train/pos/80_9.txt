I really enjoyed the meeting! I would have rated a 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was not even a mention of where they are today or why they did not attend the meeting. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was glad that TNN did the series again! I've been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to record the whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan
