I expected something different: more passion, drama ... Again, another failed attempt at originality. I'm sorry to say that the film fits the old cliched clich√©. 15-year-old teens can enjoy it. not very convincing and the common lines without any wit. Still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can not say that this movie is a total failure, because people watch but do not meet the expectations of the public and sank in mediocrity. So to conclude, production keeps you in the front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is a sensible thing. So, I think it's worth seeing if you do not get angry
