It is good to see Suraj Barjatya back to what he is best at in a story woven around a marriage. It's good to have a movie where there is not a single scene that you would avoid watching with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain new elements, you still enjoy the film, because of the presentation, performances and, in fact, the general treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. The movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love. The representation of the changes in the way of thinking, behaving as you get involved, is excellent. The director definitely paid close attention and the actors did it to perfection. Although the film is slow, you do not mind, because you kind of get so involved with the story that you just want to continue watching the joy of this new movie. couple of bride and groom. As a typical RajShree material, it has many sentimental scenes that tend to make the viewer burst into tears (especially women). But when you leave the theater you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
