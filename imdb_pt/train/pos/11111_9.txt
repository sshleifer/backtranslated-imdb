The Sopranos is perhaps the greatest opening series you could want to watch. It's smart, it's quirky, it's funny - and it carries the mob genre so well that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, set in the underworld of the criminal families of New York. Most of the time, you really do not know if the smart ones are going to stab someone in the back or buy lunch. <br /> <br /> Further enhancing the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men, most of them murderers, but by God if you do not love them either. I laughed at their jokes, I was torn apart when they went wrong, and I felt frightened by the sheer cruelty of a serious criminal. The New Jersey suburban setting is absolutely perfect for the subtext of this series - people are not always as they seem, and the contrast between monotony and actions taken by these seemingly stingy criminals even weighs probability. <br /> <br /> If you have not already, you definitely should.
