If you, as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin .... do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's such a brilliant and very cool production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also the many different situations by which he was influenced, for good and evil is incredible. There is a very good and obvious connection between comics and just that. I'm sure to be in my basement digging Tintin's albums again. In addition, the film itself is very well told and has a great sound environment. I really hope people find this as intriguing as me!
