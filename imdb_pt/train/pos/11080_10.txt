First of all, when people hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new frontiers. This movie REVOLVER is different from snatch; is much darker and is very complex. The reason I gave it a 10 note is because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. It is very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize the personal touch of Guy Ritchie (driving style) in it. <br /> <br /> What got me was the complexity of the protagonist and how we get more questions than answers.
