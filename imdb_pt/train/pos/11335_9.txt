Jake's closet has Kramer's emotional power against Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan's maze. Even the initial special effect seems to give a nod to the Pan's Labyrinth. But this is a story that occurs in modern times, not in a war of sixty years ago and, thus, has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, an only child, practically alone on the summer vacation, dealing with his family collapsing. It is a horror film like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror film for the person who thinks. If you are looking for a horror movie, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is touching and full of suspense with good acting, this is the movie for you. On display, I swear there was a moment when the whole audience shouted. I recommend getting this movie.
