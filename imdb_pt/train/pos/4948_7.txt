This is a splendidly made simplistic film that explores a theme, and gives each viewer something different than what they draw from it. The premise is simple: an unidentified celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to search for an upcoming role by visiting a store and observing people. He has particular interest in the box of the track "10 items or less" (Paz Vega), that he finds a kind, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play with each other brilliantly and bring solid character size to what is a character study. It is not a conventional study; Each of them represents entire worlds. Cashier life is mired in a rough and frustrating "real world" while the actor is so entangled in his fantasy existence that he can not perform simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He readily admits that he is putting a face when talking to people, and the whole question of researching real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the actor inspired by real people for their work. ; we also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him," and refer to how he inspired them with their roles in the movies. <br /> <br /> The favorite song from the box "Al Pasar la Barca", about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers to pay (ie: do honest work) for the boat pass, does not could have been chosen better. It resembles the character Vega, the only employee in the store with any intelligence or ambition, willing to work hard to succeed. (This is quite an aspiration, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a weird little movie, probably made with little money. If you do not mind the slow pace and a "talky" approach, this movie will entertain. The characters are perfectly contrasted and effective acting makes them captivating. A good watch.
