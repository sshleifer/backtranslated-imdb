This movie illustrates the worst part of the surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, both men and women, returning home may be the beginning of real problems. I remember my father and his brothers returning from World War II. For one of my uncles, the war never ended. He survived the D-Day invasion, something like the first 20 minutes of Rescue of Private Ryan. For him, the memories not only remained but tortured him. He became an alcoholic, as did several of my cousins, his children. Skip 60 years and put the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, I remembered that there are things about war that never change. Young people and idealistic girls are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you go against the war, you will leave with more compassion for the soldiers who try to do what they believe there or who say they are right. <br /> <br /> The slogan of the Vietnam War movie, Platoon, says it all. "The first casualty of war is innocence."
