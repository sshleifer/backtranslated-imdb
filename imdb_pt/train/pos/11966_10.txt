This is a great series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares and helps each other through the crisis is a great example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do and a lot of bad choices, but they never turn their back on the family, they work with problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from Middle Child Syndrome and with the help of EVERYONE in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing up whether her father wants it to happen or not. One thing everyone shares is that they miss their mother. Danny (father), Joey and Uncle Jesse both love these kids, and that is evident in every episode.
