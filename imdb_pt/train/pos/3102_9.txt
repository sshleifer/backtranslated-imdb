I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend and, wow! I had seen the first two movies and enjoyed them, but Ultimatum, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia who suffers a running CIA agent, trying to figure out who he is. As I said, I loved this movie from beginning to end, without holes, slow scenes, everything was perfect and it fit well with the other films, but in every way it was so much better. <br /> <br /> Best acrobatics, car chases, actors and effects I've seen in an action movie all summer (surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I was not Just action In this movie, Jason not only kills and runs. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so the drama is included. But that does not slow down. <br /> <br /> Of all the "threequels" that were released last summer, this was the best.
