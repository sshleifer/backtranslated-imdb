Yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but I am the kind of action movie fan who is difficult to destroy dragon / world-end / holy. <br /> <br /> But if you take that from my point of view this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good. But this is the kind of movie where everything gets harder at the right time, or when evil stumbles, something falls to save it at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie that surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics were very good. I mean, for this kind of movie the 3D effects were GREAT !!!! The big battle that was shown in the trailers lives up to the hype that the movie had. The struggle between good and evil in the end was, I must say it could have been longer and a little better, it was still very good. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the parts that I think could have been better. . The beginning was very good showing the parts that led to the great battles. I mean, if you really do not want to go see this movie in theaters, then at least this is a DVDer ... <br /> <br /> I generally loved the movie but the storyline just fit to fast and fit more difficult just for good.
