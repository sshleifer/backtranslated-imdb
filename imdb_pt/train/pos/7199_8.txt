Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had a series of plays on the flop after a big hit. He gets a play written by a student of his, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says he'll kill for it. I wonder if he? <br /> <br /> The thriller of a thinking man. It was originally a play ... and it shows. It's mostly on a set and everyone talks, but I've never been bored. It is very well written with many twists and a good cast working with full force. Caine is great as Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve is, surprisingly, very good. I've never thought much about him as an actor, but he's very good in that role. Dyan Cannon does wonders with a role subscribed as Bruhls wife. Irene Worth is also good (and very funny) as Helga ten Drop, a psychic. However, his accent got on my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet does very well with his first set. The camera is always moving and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie end up being furious, and it also contains one of the least romantic kisses I've ever seen - but those are soft complaints. <br /> <br /> Good suspense. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and seem to have completely disappeared since it debuted in 1982. That's too bad - it deserves better.
