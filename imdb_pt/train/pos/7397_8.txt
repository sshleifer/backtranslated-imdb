"Xizao" is the tale about the shock of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father, Liu (Xu Zhu), has died. He discovers that his father is still alive, as is his old neighborhood and his former father, the public toilet. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Da Ming's family, and as he has to learn the importance of his father's work, something he has always considered an old tradition that had to die soon. In addition, the film explores their relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well cared for, and the film never misses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very well developed and we have a glimpse of Chinese society and customs. . <br /> <br /> Director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way, letting the characters interpret the work. It's a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly into the movie, and I doubt that another style will fit into the movie as well. Zhang has enormous potential, since he can tell a story without the help of visual tricks or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and almost looks like if they were real people being filmed. The three main characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming certainly steals the show. <br /> <br /> Even when the film could have remained faithful to a condescending message of "old times were much better," attitude of balance, how to say that progress is good, and we must move forward, but not we can forget where we came from, and maintain a balance between modern life and the traditions of antiquity. <br /> <br /> and playing film. 8/10
