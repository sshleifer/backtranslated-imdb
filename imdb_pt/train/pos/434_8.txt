Good character development in a cool environment. Being a man, I probably am not qualified to fully understand, but they do a good job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It is not as gloomy as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harder. What makes this work is a wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Each has its own "thing" with which they deal. Once out of the rain and out of the cobwebs, they begin to interact and slowly lose the sense of distrust. What I liked about this movie is that he did not want a cheap comedy when he could. He did not try to teach us a lesson. People who seem totally without merit are well-developed human beings who can see the light. I had a little problem with the character of Alfred Molina having this epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, this had to happen. Good acting around with something positive occurring in the lives of some very good people.
