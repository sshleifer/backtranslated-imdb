<br /> <br /> Everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the beginning of this set of eleven pieces of eleven directors. That means that what may be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company, may not be the same for many other people, ordinary people. From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that happened, with the result the children are not impressed, like the death of a neighbor and things evidently affects them much more closely than anything that may have happened in New York, wherever it may be, this series of quasi-documentary pieces states that not all things are as equal to all men as some world leaders would try to prophesy. Since the WTC attack was obviously a cowardly event by any criterion, one gets the impression that both politicians and TV cameramen tend to blow things out of any proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. Did the same reaction at the international level have occurred if the attack had been made in Lagos, say, or in Jakarta, say, or even in Rio de Janeiro? I think not. The news seems to be distorted depending on where things happen: say much more TV time is given to an earthquake in Italy, say, than a ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia. Larger distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This eleven-part series helps put things in a better perspective - or, perhaps I should say, some of the pieces do, as each director with complete freedom invented his own story, his own perspective translation , in such a way that it is not possible to judge all merits, but individually for each eleven minute segment. <br /> <br /> By no means should we deduce that it is an anti-American film: it would be a very simple reading of the various messages manifested by the segments. However, it is also not pro-American. The eleven segments adopt varying attitudes and the common link - if any - is that the disaster of the WTC attack has to be viewed in perspective from different points of view. Only then will people like George Bush begin to understand the planet where he lives. <br /> <br /> Clearly stated in one segment is a belief I have harbored two years ago: America has not learned the lesson. And the lesson is that America has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economic persuasion or simply by force. Instead of learning that the US can not just continue to beat everyone and everywhere, its political leaders, aided and supported by Blair (and even Aznar) have become even more arrogant and intolerant, which is not doing well to anyone in Afghanistan. or Iraq in the present, much less elsewhere. The White House mentality is utterly reject: the US and UK have invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos, and so they must clarify the mess they have caused - not insisting that the UN and other nations deepen with a helping hand and so an easy exit from the turbulence. <br /> <br /> Radical postures adopted by the US (or even by Israel) will only be attended to by radical positions of the Islamic people, who have been preparing for fanatical fundamentalism for years, even if it is to cover up their own males. uselessness, that is, the stoning of women to death or simply by covering them from the top of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of some rich countries that seem inclined to not see or understand anything from more multilateral perspectives. This eleven-part film accurately portrays this dark and mute posture.
