Someone used to say, about Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe the same remark may suit the McDonald-Eddy photos. And especially this one here. <br /> <br /> Apparently it has many features of a failed movie: it's kitschy, the script, because of the censorship, sounds inconsistent ?? However, this movie also brings some good points: good music by Rodgers-Hart ("I Married an Angel", "Strip Takes a Hand"), good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you may not like it, you can not forget. This strange movie leaves a very strong, dreamlike impression, and it is very likely that you will keep this in mind for days, perhaps for weeks. Because? In the 1930s and early 1940s, movies did not have the same meaning as today: they aimed, as a dream, to divert the audience to make forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream movies that were made, at that time, this one is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say the best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it without thinking. whether good or bad. Watch, as if you watched a dream.
