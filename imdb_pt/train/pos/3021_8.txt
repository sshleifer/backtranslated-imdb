but worth seeing for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainments that were filmed during the war required transplanting to the American shores, as in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall fits that part here. I kept waiting for her to whistle and bring Bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply wrong for a high-class Englishwoman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not talk like that except in books, but Greene was sending a message about an England that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's range of characters were kept whole. While Mr. Mukerjee looked more like a Brahamin, at least his nationality was maintained, and his final conversation with Paxinou is invaluable.
