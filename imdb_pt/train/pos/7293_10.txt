What do I say about such a beautiful movie? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, considering that this is my main city. I'm very fond of science fiction and I like action-type movies. It turned out that I stayed up all night and was almost ready to end the day I noticed this movie playing in the morning. This is not science fiction or action movie of any kind. Let me start by saying that I'm not a Witchblade fan or Eric Etebari, having watched a few episodes (his performance seemed obsolete and robotic). But he really managed to convince me in this performance. I mean, really conquering me. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was any way to act for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply incredible. He was extremely convincing as the evil demon. But there were so many in-depth details for this character that impressed me. Later, I searched online and found out that Eric won the Best Actor award, which is well deserved, considering it the best of his career and earned my respect. Now I keep reading about the fx of this and the production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very well done, but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more their goal (seeing movies like Godzilla with huge effects really discouraged me). I could not sleep after this movie thinking of my head again and again. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her because she lived with abuse. This is a movie that I constantly think and recommend.
