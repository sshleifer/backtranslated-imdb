It was so true for this documentary that I had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it might include some acting, but it's not. Everything is real. History is not new to people in developing and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the people's manipulation by corporate media, disinformation, the artificial polarization of people deliberately creating tension in the streets, sometimes to the point of the army, intelligence agency or even government (many believe, led by the US ) use agents who attack "any" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justify their blows. A marine officer in the movie mentions that too. That they wanted to see the people confronting each other in the streets. All of these scenarios were played in Turkey (US pet in the Middle East) throughout its history which has suffered 3 blows and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been ironically exposed through a conservative / conservative religious media. opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army officer to provoke the people etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unique is that they were filming from the inside, perhaps by chance, when the events happened. Of course the directors are for Chavez. Whether that would cause the directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know. <br /> <br /> And if Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the US dictatorship and the global economy without repressing any opposing thinking with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hopeful and I think it's worth taking the risk.
