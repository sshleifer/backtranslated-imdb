Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like. It is not his everyday Western - he wears an rifle, which passes the hands of various characters - as a mechanism to tell the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a girl who has to deal with the realities of her husband and the wild west. It is important to note for those politically correct types - they kill many Indians in this movie without remorse. By today's standards, it's still very violent. But it's a great story and worth seeing. Appreciate!
