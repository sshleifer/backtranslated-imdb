Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-comedy concept about proprietor Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by the perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comical performance advancement sure stratosphere him to list A), a technology services rep for an electronics store in Southern California which I found out about her secret identity by a trio of well-intentioned, but utterly clueless co-workers (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each grades funnier than the next) determined to get her friend deflowered, no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely but very warm romance with a lively mother (the wonderful Keener having a great time here), leading to adding more fuel to the fireworks inside Andy. A romantic comedy surprisingly joyful and without remorse; the most funny since "There's Something About Mary," with a cunningly watchful script by director Judd Apatow and Carell, which features some surprising sequences, including a joke by David Caruso, homophobic unmasking comments, reminiscences of "date-a-paloozas" and demystifying the war of the sexes with daring resourcefulness. A true winner and an instant classic; the funniest movie of the year.
