This film is much better than the version of asylum, especially the war of the worlds. The tripods look really cool, but the walk and the killings could have been better. The action scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! oh my God stop walking please or I'm going to kill myself. The children's thunder scene was my favorite sequel, especially since a ship crammed a lot of tripods. Good movie I recommend to people who have read the book. The music is incredible and the cut of the directors seems pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Pros. Good 99% soundtrack for the book Cool Violence Tripods and handling machines are cool to look at for the cons. some bad acting cheese looking london
