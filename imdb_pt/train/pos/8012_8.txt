As far as the Muppet line is concerned, however, this is not the best nor the second best. This has been marketed to children, but there are some dark and emotionally disturbing adult moments to which parents may not want to expose their children. One of them shows Miss Piggy going through "anger" in an envious rage, which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> In addition, however, the story is progressive and highly entertaining. One scene where Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go crazy in a department store is simply hilarious! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of levity and fun. <br /> <br /> I really like it, and I still like it today. <br /> <br /> The rate is 7.6. / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
