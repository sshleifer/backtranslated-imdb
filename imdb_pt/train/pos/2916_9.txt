Of all the movies I've seen, and that's the majority of them, this is by far the best done which is mostly about US naval airships (Blimps) during the WW-II era. Yes, there are other good movies related to the LTA, but most uses special effects more than any photo in real time. The Navy of Man has much more real time images of dirigibles, etc. It's true, there are many sharp dialogues, but that's what makes Hollywood movies more interesting to this day. P.S. I spent 10 years (20) and have more than 5,000 hours in Navy aircraft of all kinds, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Naval Airship Association, etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN retired]
