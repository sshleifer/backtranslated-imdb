I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, nor am I sure if this can be applied. In recent years, movie theaters have been full of comedy movies that are too stupid to even make us smile. Therefore, I have considered movies that do not meet these requirements as "serious comedies." <br /> <br /> Does the 40 Year Old Virgin fit into this guild? This is finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You get to laugh a lot, moreover, it offers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty, there's more than a 40-year-old virgin out there, and even people who do not exactly fit these specifications, may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men. <br /> <br /> The story, as the title goes, is about Andy, a shy, quiet guy who collects action figures, notes Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. Kal is Andy's colleague at SmartTech. He believes Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but even so he seems to get what he wants with the opposite gender. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who ran away with another guy. . And Jay, a man in a relationship who seems to be affected by his continual cheating and getting caught up in deeds. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of the 13 to 21 year olds have watched this movie, but there really is no age limit to be able to take advantage of it. So, in case you have not seen and enjoyed a bit of laughter, with social commentary, go to your movie store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from top to bottom.
