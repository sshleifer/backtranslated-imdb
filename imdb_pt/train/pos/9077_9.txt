I really liked the pilot, it was as amazing as I expected it to be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought I would not be able to support his character. He and Megyn Price had little chemistry, but I hope that, over time, they will be more comfortable with each other. It must have been strange for Megyn to stop being the star of her last show ["Grounded For Life"] to be a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson look very new to the whole Sitcom scene, but I think over time they will get better. David Spade's character, to my surprise, was not the pilot's full focus. The way he delivers his lines is so unlike any other person I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all doubts and struggles and be unsure about their decisions, about what this program is about. All situations where the characters are placed look like real life, not sugar coated like most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope, for all the actors, that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series, if only given the chance and the time.
