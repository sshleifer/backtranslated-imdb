I saw it at the Legacy Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I suppose a person's level of pleasure during this movie will be largely based on the level of acceptance of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> However, this was very well done, well represented and a good score. If you come to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it at the Legacy Theater. I've never been to a better theater as much as the picture quality, sound quality, and ambiance throughout my life ... I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there! Being that I am LDS and I consider Joseph as a prophet, I have been touched in several places and I have cried a few times ... which I presume to be expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie began! Anyway, I was told that this movie is available at several LDS Visitor Centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes of checkout because whether you believe in Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
