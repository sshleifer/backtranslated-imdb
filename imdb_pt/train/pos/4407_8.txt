For those who commented on The Patriot as being accurate, (which basically demonized English), it was interesting to see this film. According to all accounts, this was the bloodiest war that Americans were ever involved in, and they were the only nationality present. It was, therefore, very refreshing to see something similar to the historical precision coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint America as martyrs or saviors. After all, what this movie brought home were the real horrors of any conflict, and how all the acts committed in the war only lead to worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie in which you applauded anyone, but both of you lamented and hated everyone.
