A delightful piece of film narrative in a simple but effective way. Cinema is after all a visual media and Igor has used his full potential. A restless young man boards a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets a girl. The words are not changed, but the washing of clothes is done and from there we are taken for a walk with other characters and peculiar situations. The two protagonists are perfectly listed, because their unique characteristics tell a story that does not need words.
