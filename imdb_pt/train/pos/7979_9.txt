Tony Scott can make good and bad movies personally, I think he can be a bit flashy and useless and his work obviously suffers compared to that of his rather famous brother, but this is possibly his best film. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so good is that Scott gives Denzel (in a sizzling way, better than Training Day) and the revelation of who Dakota Fanning is to develop a relationship of true warmth and tenderness. The setup is not boring at all, although it takes time - involve and take us on a short journey to the characters - including a terrific role for Radha Mitchell as her mother. This all serves to make the action much more effective, since we are so involved in the characters, for all their too obvious weaknesses. This movie has you on the limit in its entirety, and also does not dodge the end. <br /> <br /> The movie, of course, would be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have so many duff roles when he is clearly as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis who has more power on the screen in the days of today) . This film should have been huge, given its status and the strength of its performance, and the quality of the film. This shows that if a studio does not support a movie to the fullest, it ends up going straight to the video. I wish I had the chance to see it on the big screen.
