Stargate SG-1 is a kind of spin-off of the 1994 movie "Stargate." I am so glad they decided to expand the subject. The show starts rolling from the first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet up with his old partner, Dr. Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we find Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not let anyone pass by, and there is Teal'c, a calm and compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main villains are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be inserted into your brain, controlling them and committing evil deeds. Any Gouald who has a tremendous amount of power is often regarded as a "System Lord." The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, who harbor the Gouald parasite in their bodies until the Gouald can be inserted into a person's brain. Through the episodes, we usually see the SG-1, the exploratory team composed of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, traverse the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they encounter new crops or bandits. Some episodes are in the world, which means they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and deal with pressing issues on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you get to see a decline in the SG -1 team so united, and more character building story lines. This, in turn, means even more episodes in the world, which is perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although most of this program is good, there are some examples of stories not always wrapping up and less emphasis on travel in recent years. But still, top-quality science fiction!
