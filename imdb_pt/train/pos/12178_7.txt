I think this movie has a low rating because it was judged by its worst moments. There is a joke of diarrhea and an embarrassing scene, but in addition there are some moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee is presenting a wonderfully subtle comedy in this film and Julia Stiles manages to be very funny. Also, this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, best movies to watch, but definitely not the worst choice ... Congratulations
