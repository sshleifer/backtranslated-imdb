Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, tender, courageous and lover. It gives a superior dimension to a film that is still a masterpiece, both by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) and by the story or the rhythm . Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
