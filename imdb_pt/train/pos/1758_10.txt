I was really surprised by this movie. Going to the premiere, not knowing anything about the movie, except for the trailer I saw, I thought it was going to be some kind of Dude Where's My Car. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic main character who will fuck in the end, because that's how the movies work. Instead, I got a clever and amazingly original movie about a decent, average guy who has never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is full of sexual jokes and vulgarity, and occasionally, hey-look-nipple-but it's done a lot in the spirit of Bad Santa instead of Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to fool a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I came in thinking that this movie would be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's very exaggerated (come on, it's a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very well done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you're really pulling this guy to have sex, which says a lot about the movie because, honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found your car or not?
