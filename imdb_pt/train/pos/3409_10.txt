North Africa in the 1930s. For a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara, a beautiful woman emerges who seeks a meaning for her life and a handsome Trappist monk who escapes her crisis of faith. They will meet and the passions will be agitated, but not even the Sand Diviner will know if they will find happiness or sadness, here, in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure hokum, but the film is still very fun and cute to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are a couple of superb screens. She is simply beautiful, and Boyer gives a more effective and discreet performance, letting her sensitive face do much of her acting for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a nice role as a count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a sympathetic and talkative guide (all the "Arab" he and others speak of in the film is pure jargon); Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic book porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as an old and wise priest. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (peering over the nun's shoulder) as convent girls; Nigel De Brulier, skinny as a monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as an employee of the hotel, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The colorful 1930s movies are rare and adorable to see, and this movie is no exception - cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be filmed on the spot. Yuma, Arizona, gave the filmmakers all the sand dunes they could wish for, but it contaminated the drinking water and the 135-degree heat soon left the company in disgust. When the daily races showed that Boyer's face had burned a bright red tomato, producer David O. Selznick finally gave up. The rest of the film was filmed on a Hollywood stage.
