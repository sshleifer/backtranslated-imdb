Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine is just beginning for this (there is no site yet? With?), So I doubt most have already heard about this. In fact, I also had not (more or less). When I got the post, I thought it was another code name and I was really worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when it's not working, so I take full advantage of it as a mere viewer of deadly movies. Turns out it was not Transformers and I was aware of it from when, like 'that Neil Gaiman movie'. What is this about? Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. More than that and I would be giving plot information which is (a) a breach of contract and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it's all about, go buy the book. There are rumors that Gaiman may be a kind of writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so enjoyable if the surprise is worth it. And for this, it certainly was. This exhibition was "special" as it included not only film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a cross-cultural showing) and local fiction / fantasy staff. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the Stardust title, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how sweetly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a fairy tale written by a famous author in the comic book. But it was not the Lord of the Rings. He was no longer a wannabe of the Lord of the Rings (ahn, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all this. <br /> <br /> But like the Lord of the Rings, it was the humanism of the movie that sold the fantastic qualities. It is certainly a romantic tale, but with generous touches of humor. And that mood is the kind that is not Shrekism. It's more along the lines of drama than of comedy. Before we go any further, let's review the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is at least good. It is always difficult to say more than that to fantasy films, but I believe there have been significant and superbly represented roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not, unfortunately, one of these. She plays a villain and does the job. Nothing special. But Rupert Everett was a complete idiot. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter Frickin O'Toole - which is wonderful. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be enjoying himself most of the time. When he wanted to deliver the goods, however, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the main character was a great surprise from a guy I've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been of mixed opinion with her. She may be great, and then it looks like she might miss the mark. In this, she is the first. And she's literally the star of this movie. Of course, your accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox is not on the scene. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are silenced, but realized, and only meaningful where they should be. Best flying ship yet - sorry Potter. The steering is light and flows very well. Cinematography could have been better, but not everyone films in New Zealand. Everything else is square brackets. <br /> <br /> And now that this is done ... <br /> <br /> writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you demon. It is difficult in the current climate to do something original, and at first you begin to wonder. A kingdom, an agonizing king, a boy to prove his worth, witches, ghosts, a mission (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you with your superficial familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And although you suspect how things will end, you begin to wonder in the third act and - if it is me - you see yourself in the exciting climatic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be, but often are not. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs. Tristan, but I will not ruin everything for you. <br /> <br /> For those who read the book, rest assured, it was done correctly. Those I talked to later had the same impression as me. A great movie for all ages, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank space is only filled in after the movie's release because, well, you may be waiting for it. You'll know when to leave, anyway. I truly hope the Stardust does not get lost among the tentacles. Even if that happens, it will be a pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> <br /> I forgot to add the {WITHHELD}. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Maybe a little high evaluation, but I'm still confident that years are formed now, there will be the same "Oh, I love this movie" response to this, as now exists for the princess bride
