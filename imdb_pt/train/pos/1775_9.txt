I often wonder why this series was much criticized. I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and executed. I think that at the time of coming this will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever cast it. Many comedians and young comedy actors appeared in this and everyone went on to bigger things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and no less Julian Rhind-Tutt than the huge and successful Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of the modern era. Anyone who could produce comedies like Father Ted would not be able to write something that was not worthy of publication. If it is ever issued, I will certainly buy it.
