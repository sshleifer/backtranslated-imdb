What are the chances of a helium balloon "Mermaid" traveling from Yuba City, California (on November 8, 1993) and landing 4 days later, (on November 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film helps not only children deal with losses, but older people as well. I hope everyone likes it !!! Rhonda
