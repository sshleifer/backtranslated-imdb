It's not Braveheart (fortunately), but it's good entertainment with engaging characters and good acting around. I liked this movie when it was released and upon seeing it again last week, I discovered it has weathered well over time. It's not a classic movie, but a very good and watchable movie to enjoy great entertainment.
