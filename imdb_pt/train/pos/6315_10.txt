Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it's none of the following: <br /> <br /> A vehicle star George Clooney Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know, the base for the film is another movie. But as far as Hollywood is concerned, this can be classified with its most authentic productions in this decade - and for me, that happens. <br /> <br /> The film is from beginning to end, an absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is not a bad performance in the movie. The funny parts are funny. Nerve parts are nervous. The script contains, not a moment of monotonous dialogue Cinematography is new and rather beautiful. And that does not conform to Hollywood standard (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing ads for the movie. This movie came on the radar after not winning much at the box office, nor is it a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by movie goers is because they are accustomed to seeing Transformers 2. If the film is as original and funny as this, since many millions of pieces of s ** t movie experience it would be a much cooler place - <br /> <br /> When 'they' say they do not do as they used to, 'they' did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> /> A fun, captivating mini-comedy masterpiece that refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
