This is a very memorable western spaghetti. It has a great plot, interesting characters and a very good performance, especially by Rosalba Neri. His role as evil villain in this movie is truly classic. She steals every scene in which she is, and expresses much with her face and eyes, even when she is not speaking. His performance is very believable. It can be quite mesmerizing without being exaggerated (not that there is anything wrong with being exaggerated). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie as well. <br /> <br /> The score is excellent, and the theme song is the type that will play in your head constantly for days after watching the movie, whether you want it. to or not. There are some parts that are a lot of fun. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri strips off in front of the parrot. There is also a lot of guns that is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would probably have given this film 8 or 9 stars if it was not for two things. The first is a silly fight that takes about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous fights I've ever seen in a movie. It's very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number than a bad musical than any kind of real fight. We could ignore this if it were a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious Western, and the fight really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that bothered me about this movie was Yuma's fellow Mexican coward. I think it should be a comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like that, and he was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> All that being said, let me assure everyone that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western, despite the flaws I mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.
