Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a rifle, a Winchester in a shooting contest. Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a bad loser and steals the arma.Lin takes his horse and goes after Dutch and his men and rifle with his friend High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The rifle enters different hands on the way. He will return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and created this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play the lead. He was always the right man to do anything. The fantastic Shelley Winters play Lola Manners' part and she's great as always. Dan Duryea is fantastic for the role of Waco Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend, Steve Miller. Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the film, and they are played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point the group is surrounded by Indians, as this is a western. It's great to watch this survival game, where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner. All true western fans will love this movie.
