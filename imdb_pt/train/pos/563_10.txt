The second-to-last collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (excluding the few days that Mann worked on Night Passage before separating from the star in less than friendly circumstances), The Far Country belies its conventional look to offer another portrait of a bitter man involuntarily dragged into his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way. This time he is a cattle driver, whose response to labor problems - defying troubled cowboys for a gunshot at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire's law school judge Roy Bean. Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge while he deceives them or kills them out of their claims ... Although not great Surprise that Stewart turns in the end, he is a surprisingly insensitive animal along the way, even using his desire to be left alone to apologize does not warn a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance, because it's not his problem. . For most of the film there is really only a hair difference between him and McIntire, something the judge immediately recognizes, reveling in the company of a similar spirit, even when he is gently planning to lynch it. In many ways the people of the city who put their faith in him probably recognize that too - despite their appeals to their better dead and buried nature, there is a tacit acknowledgment that the only person who can stand the judge is someone almost as bad as with Mann, there is an exceptional use of high places, although at least once, the final confrontation takes place on flat ground, and the film is almost perfectly released with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman ( although Corinne Calvert's young romantic interest shifted to the annoying one). Unfortunately, the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is little favored by a distinctly average DVD transfer with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.
