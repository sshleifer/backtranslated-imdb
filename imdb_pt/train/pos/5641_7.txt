Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are some holes in the plot; yes, it has a quality made for TV; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget all this ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun in an After School Kind of special, but fun anyway. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as mother does a great job ... so good that I will start watching her movies. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also does a great job. If I were a casting agent, I would be exploring some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are above the usual standards of TV and the music was really great ... better than several big budget films I saw. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for German noir this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and underrated movie, this is a good movie. It's one that you could show your 10-year-old daughter, but enjoy it too.
