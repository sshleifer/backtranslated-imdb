Especially for a time when little science fiction was being filmed (1973), this is a fantastic vision of a future where everything went wrong. Lots of people and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It's set in New York in 2022 (I think), and it resembles your worst view of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I began to appreciate the performance of Charlton Heston after seeing him in Touch of Evil by Orson Welles. He was (may be) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here he is torn between being a policeman who is just a little corrupt (having food rations rich in the rich), and being totally corrupt (actively tolerating evil). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to take place at night, and sweat runs from everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Even though I have not seen this before, I knew the famous ending (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly anticipated. Big scenes with Edward G. Robinson: Going to the council (made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents, it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then going to Thanatopsis to check. <br/> <br/> Gritty, pre-Star Wars, dystopian science fiction.
