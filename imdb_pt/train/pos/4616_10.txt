The title of this movie is taken from a party game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, NY, and he describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other preteen teen kissing games. According to the rules, a boy's and a girl's names would be drawn, and the chosen ones had orders to come together in a dark closet and stand there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there would be speculation among party guests whether or not the two had the courage to hold hands, hug and / or kiss in the closet's privacy. At the end of seven minutes, the game leader would say, "Time is up" or knock on the closet door, and the couple would come out of the closet. After being questioned by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their "Seven Minutes in Heaven." Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. The couple who admitted doing the best would be the winner of the game. <br /> <br /> These games have served as social "ice breakers" for children and teens, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy people. . The film received this title because it deals with the first experiences of adolescents with passions and romantic love.
