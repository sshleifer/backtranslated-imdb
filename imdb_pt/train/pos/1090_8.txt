One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size, the housing would now be a mansion of dreams. Still, Cary was earning a living in the advertising field, though he was trying to find a catchphrase for Wham-branded ham. <br /> <br /> What made this movie so interesting? Popular was the lack of housing in the post-World War II years. Veterans who returned from the war were claiming their rights under the GI Bill of Rights, which included home loans. The problem was there literally there were not enough homes to meet the demand. By the time Eric Hodgins's book and film were so popular, Congress approved and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act, which put the government first in the home-building business. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and an aunt who were at the same time building their own house in which they moved in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and wanted to leave downtown Rochester. Their place was not as grand as a Connecticut house with eighteen rooms, but they still lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna probably did. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive and the costs kept rising, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer advice, usually too late. Truth be told that he's kind of sweet on Myrna, and Cary knows it. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles is moving to the country and that William Powell has the headaches that Cary Grant does, the film would still work very well. <br /> <br /> Blandings Builds Your Dream House still works well as comedy because situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate, who have lived together in the dream house for over 40 years.
