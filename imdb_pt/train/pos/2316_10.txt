I watched this movie by chance, I'm curious about the trailer on TV. I like it when I discover movies like this, little stories about ordinary people. Even if the ending is tragic, "The Man on the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in Dani's first characterization with his innocent and pure love for Court. It's really a beautiful and thrilling love story with 3 highlights: Reese Witherspoon's performance, which kept its promises in the movie world, the beautiful cinematography of "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the fantastic soundtrack of James Newton Howard, which is really the soul of the movie. Their themes (which deserve an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that it seems they have turned the script into music.
