I saw this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It is simply amazing how homosexual relationships between author and protagonist are sublimated in the film. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gays. <br /> <br /> The movie begins slowly, but when we revisit it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that writer / director Brooks creates. <br /> <br /> Notice the incredible cut at the beginning, where assassins and killers are linked. Cutter on the phone is matched for Perry on the phone. Cutter washing the face is combed for Perry to wash his face. Only Perry is looking in the mirror and seeing her eroticized male body creates a costume to play a guitar in Las Vegas to empty the chairs. This failure / fantasy coincides with the fantasy-flaw that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska just to find it perpetually empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about firing pheasants and the fact that the pheasants do not know they will die. we cut to the clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream about a yellow bird, "taller than Jesus" that attacks the nuns who chased them. "The nuns begged for mercy," he tells us, "but the bird killed them anyway." The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says he has aversion to nuns, god, and religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom. <br /> <br /> The director puts on all kinds of what-ifs and only-ifs. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep in a friends house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a photo of her and the house later. Nancy can not sleep at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming to dinner. The decision seals your destiny. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre." But it's another picture of Bogart, "Beat the Devil," which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of this film ended up with nothing. Dick wants the cash, the $ 10,000 he thinks is in Clutter's vault (which, ironically, is as fanciful as Perry's Mexican Treasure). Cut to Herb Clutter by signing $ 40,000 life insurance. He is thinking about mortality at the moment. Ironically, its mortality is about to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes you a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours. Dick said they did not want witnesses so no one would remember them. Later, in fact, it is because they have eliminated all the witnesses they were reminded of. <br /> <br /> A witness, "the detective goes on to say Dick later. <br /> <br /> But was it witnessing the friend of prison house, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? <br /> <br /> The viewer becomes the witness after watching to the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating film.
