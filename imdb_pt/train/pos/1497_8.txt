This film is a rather fun horror anthology film (in the vein of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's good fun for horror fans and has a great cast. The film must also be seen for Doctor Who fans, as Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has a fun role as a star of rude and nasty terror!
