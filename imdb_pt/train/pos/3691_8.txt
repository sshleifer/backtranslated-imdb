The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problems. This film features a line-up of some of the most creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. The segments are created around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. Actually, considering that approaching the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms, it's incredible that we might even feel like we're still watching the same movie. No great effort was made to turn it into a comprehensive whole. This buffet has many great ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in one single dish.
