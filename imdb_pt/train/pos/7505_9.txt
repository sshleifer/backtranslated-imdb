If there's a genre I've never been a fan of, it's the biopic. Always misleading, full of false information, overly dramatized scenes and tricks everywhere, biopics are almost never done properly. Even in the hands of truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Brilliant Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skepticism takes the place of hype with most of the biopic coming to the big screen and Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and bystanders opposed Gretchen Mol, who took on the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and did not have the chops for the role. I never doubted that Mol could handle the role ever since, but I never expected to be as impressed by her performance as I was watching the movie hours ago. Mol does an Academy Award-winning performance as the iconic 1950s girl who, after a lifetime of abuse (portrayed with subtlety and good taste, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most commented models of all time. . The image covers a lot of ground in its 90 minutes, though no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing in the story. The fantastic screenplay by director / co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner is only marked by too abrupt and not as clear as it should end. Still, you have to give credit to the two ladies for creating an almost flawless biographical film that manages to honor both the theme and the decade that it imitates with mastery. When it comes to Oscar, Mol, Turner and Harron should be getting leads. Doubt will happen, though there certainly are not three women more deserving of them. 9/10
