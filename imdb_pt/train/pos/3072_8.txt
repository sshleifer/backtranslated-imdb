Panic is a little gem of a movie - you think you figured it out in the first half hour just to realize, with great pleasure, that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director than that. The film develops slowly, with one scene quietly devastating behind the other, all perfectly staged by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most notable child actor who I met. I have seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who offers his lines as if they were completely improvised thoughts being created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.
