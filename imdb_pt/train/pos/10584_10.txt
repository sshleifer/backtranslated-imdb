"Parade Footlight" is fascinating on many levels. There is no way that the supposedly staged "theater prologues" have been produced in any theater on Earth, of course. Think of the huge pools and tall three-story fountains of "For a Waterfall," for example. (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They made me a criminal" six years later and had the Dead End Kids sing "By a Waterfall" while they showered.) "Shanghai Lil" is the best number of the image. It is a catalog of sensibilities of Warner Bros. Note the African faces mixed with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other period films, unless they were trainers or maids in a big house. Here the blacks are sitting at the bar and singing with the others. I also get excited when military dancers make a presentation in the card section of Roosevelt's picture. There is also the Eagle NRA - the New Deal controversial National Recovery Administration logo. FDR was the new president and the hopes were so high that he would take the nation out of the Depression. You would never see something so hard-line oriented out of MGM, of course. A Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the increase dictated by F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than she is playing the Chinese whore, "Lil." She barely looks at her feet while dancing, which was one of the failures of her signature. <br /> <br /> The pre-code stuff is fun. The number "By a Waterfall" is wonderful in this respect. The girls swap swimsuits on the crowded bus past Times Square with all the lights on. The extended eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of groin pitch that would not have been seen for 35 years. In a few months, the Production Code would eliminate these impertinent pleasures.
