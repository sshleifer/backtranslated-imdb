The world of Dragon Hunters is a world challenged by 3D gravity. Planetoides, pieces of buildings and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere, while the ground toward most of the characters are falling nowhere to be seen. It's a world reminiscent of Neverending Story, when Nothing came to devour the world. <br /> <br /> Funny, the villain here is also the World Gobbler. This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with eyes of fire. The heroes are a large and yet taciturn warrior, a boring and greedy helper who manages the duo's entrepreneurial side and a strange, useless animal. They join the most talkative little girl in the world who, to my disappointment, did not die a painful and hopefully premature death. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. The voices and sounds are top notch. Too bad the story is as simple as you can imagine. They will stop the World Gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they defeat him. The end. No real development of character or story revolves. Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such a plot. <br /> <br /> In short: it's a cute thing to see, kids would probably have fun, but that's all. No depth to this world (pun intended).
