Although I bought the DVD when it first came out, and I've seen it several times, I've never written a review. <br /> <br /> I loved it when I first saw it and still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems like you've never made enough money to motivate someone to do a follow-up. I have to assume qt still controls rights, but after Kill Bill if he makes a movie that's as true to comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another tough female lead, someone unfamiliar with the character will see this as Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense than on action thrillers. <br /> <br /> The pull of wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true. to the source material and is tense, suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who does not have to have blood and explosions. Alexandra did a great job of interpreting how O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this particularly ahead of the curve after the extremely necessary reboots of Batman and James Bond. After two bleak efforts, though not as well known to the public, this is really a reboot of the Modesty character, and it's really sad that probably no other movie about it is made.
