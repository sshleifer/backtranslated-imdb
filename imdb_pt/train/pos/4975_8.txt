By God, it's been a long time since I've seen this. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The movie tells us (children) all about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally put together - Disney-style animation, plus human actors - was directed by Frank Capra, for God's sake! Half an exaggeration. I wonder if the very high production value is worth the value of the information of a film strip on the human body? But the boy will see these children learning: by now I can clearly remember Dr. Baxter being challenged by Hemo himself to name the common material more like human blood, to which the Doctor immediately responds "sea water."
