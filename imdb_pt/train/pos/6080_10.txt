Othello, the classic Shakespearen story about love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story at school, I actually thought that Othello was probably my favorite story of Shakespeare, because it was fascinating, that Shakespeare perfectly captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, you could get into so many philosophies about why Othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. Later, however, for my report, I also saw this version of Othello and have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just pick up the story so well and understand that it's the darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is the great soldier of his city, he is loved by all, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello has fled with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is enraged, but excepts. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his man aside, instead of Iago, who stayed by Othello. Due to his insane jealousy, he is out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he just insinuates Othello that Desdemona is betraying him with Cassio, never says they are, just makes Othello think that this is happening. Othello is insane and has no pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I recommend you read it. It's an incredible story that makes you think after reading. Othello the movie is also great and once again I recommend, he captured the story perfectly and has a great kind of sensation, or you could be in shock with what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes his true love would betray him. This is a fantastic film, great performance, good sets and good direction, that's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
