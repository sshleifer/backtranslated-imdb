Convinced, infuriating and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to sit down, but Parker Posey is actually the only actress who could take this story and run with it. She is at once touching, funny, cunning. The supporting actors are also committed to this. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you the plot. It involves characters from Henry Fool of Hartley and tries a tale of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue together - understand. In a way, completely ridiculous. It becomes increasingly ridiculous as you move forward. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous cinephile willing to deal with something that is not a cookie cutter. In the end, it offers something that defies description.
