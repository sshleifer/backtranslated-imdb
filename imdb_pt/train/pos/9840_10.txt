Born again Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man could come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live on a little girl's head <br /> <br /> Revenge he would get <br /> <br /> By the murder he's known <br /> <br /> By the face that's now in his wife's bed <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a highly underrated classic episode that makes part of what set The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the first show came along and I was too young to watch it as parts of The Jersey Devil but I specifically remember watching that episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely scared by the scene where the guy is hanged to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode has a special aura now of the strangeness factor that I have grown since then. It's enough to let me look beyond some of the obvious flaws in the storyline, such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 years old before her earlier life-spirit actually started demanding her revenge. Or what she was doing randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think your parents would be worried. And maybe they were we do not really see that part of the story. And it was with telekinesis? Aside from adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already frightening story, there really was not any kind of good explanation for it. But even with its minor flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and has little or no reason for me not to like it. 10 out of 10.
