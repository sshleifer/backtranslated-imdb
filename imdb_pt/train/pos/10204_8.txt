Although not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I liked Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read the comic book and only saw it in the store and decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> The animation was OK, I got the feel of the 80's anime from it, which is what set it for me. Why everyone hates it is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Character development was good. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death. for you who do not like it, obviously was not paying attention. Lucifer tells him how this happens, and she used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a good mentor / soldier to her. his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone here who hit it needs to take a new look at it and reconsider. Because all that people have beaten this can be said about everyone's favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
