The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with buffalo hunting, as much as a sport and business, and as a method of winning indigenous plains wars. Before the white man stepped on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains used to have flocks of American bison as large as some of our larger cities. At the time of the period in which The Last Hunt was created, the buffalo had been eliminated. The 20th century, due to the efforts of conservationists, saw a rebirth in the species population, but not as it once was. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger are co-starring together in a second film. and this is far superior to all the brothers were brave. Here Stewart Granger is the cool guy, a world-weary buffalo hunter who has to get back to a job he hates because of financial considerations. <br /> <br /> The partner with whom he chose to lie down is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor at the moment, I doubt there has ever been a soul more evil and unpleasant than Charlie Gilsen, whom Taylor portrays. On Devil's Doorway, he was an American Indian fighting against the prejudice instigated by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, he's the racist here. It kills buffaloes and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills an Indian family when they steal their mules and leads the widow of a captive. Like some barbaric conqueror, he awaits the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. He's really crazy when Paget does not see it that way. <br /> No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed, I was never really convinced that he was an Indian part. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However Lloyd Nolan, the gray old buffalo skinner Taylor and Granger bring is simply great. Nolan steals all the scenes with the cast. <br /> <br /> For those who like their real westerns, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen onscreen, and who does not like cheap heroism, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
