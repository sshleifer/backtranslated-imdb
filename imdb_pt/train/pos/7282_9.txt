This was a very good movie and it is absolutely unfair to judge it without regard to the time it was released. There are some movies that do not age, but this is clearly outdated. However, I saw this movie when I was a boy and for over twenty years, both the pictures and the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we were able to enjoy it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this movie as the subject of several conversations and meetings where older boys talked about things we have in common. So there was a small feeling of disappointment and even sadness when we finally got the DVD. First, there was a theory about how naive our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would like this film to have something that should be interesting to all modern filmmakers, specifically those who focus on the decadent horror genre. This is the mutilation, the idea that gives coherence to the film; the fact that a mutilated human being produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick it felt when the monster ripped Kurt's arm. And at the end when the creature bites the doctor's neck to get a piece of his veins. Another notable thing is the morbid atmosphere that prevails without decaying in intensity in every scene, no matter if the action is in a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striper locker, and so on. May be the reasons why it is not a good movie anymore are just technical things. For example, at the scene of the accident and the man saving his bride's head, a more precise job, made for another modern second-unit director, might be interesting. Same thing with all the action scenes, including that of Kurt's arm. Also, something could be done with the monster makeup. Some remakes were good; I think in this case an attempt would be worth it. However, the black and white tones should be preserved.
