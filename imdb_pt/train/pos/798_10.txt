This excellent drama left me in suspense all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this intriguing murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how life can be sad and difficult. I actually cried in the end (which I do not want to give away!) It also lets me realize how cruel and nauseating people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only member of the bad cast was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director did not. I say this because he met someone who did not look at all like Anne Marie Fahey herself.
