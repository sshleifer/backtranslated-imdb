From time to time, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a movie like "The Golden Child", especially. This is a movie that you would imagine would star perhaps Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone. But Eddie really works; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, courteous, economical, clean, and everything else a hero should be. <br /> <br /> Having been chosen to secure a mystical child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (perfectly embodied by Dance), Eddie goes from California to Nepal and back, while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he is all he claims to be and an old crazy man (Wong, perfect as ever) knows that he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, breathtaking, shocking and, of course, funny. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start a movie making rude comments behind a guy reading a porn magazine and ending with smart comments about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "child": it is a "Golden" find. <br /> <br /> Nine stars.
