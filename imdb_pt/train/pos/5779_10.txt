For starters, I did not even know about this show for a year or more because of the internet. I have not seen it once on TV before in my country, and many people do not usually know about this show. It's a shame because this is easily the most original and intelligent animation I have witnessed in years. <br /> <br /> I do not distribute a lot 10 points, but this is a show that really deserves everything 10 points. Even though this may seem like a typical cartoon at first glance, but keep in mind that this is not a spectacle for children. When the full story unfolds, you know this is a real deep plot with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on animal-spirits, an old Indian believes it has been preserved for many years. This gives the show an original twist that you often can not find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also something very different. Sometimes it looks a bit like Spawn in terms of design, and sometimes it takes a more visual approach. I believe that David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, has animated a segment in the show (as he also designed this segment in the comics). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show of twisting the mind, a show that assumes various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you start watching, you'll probably watch it to the end. A minor fact may be that the program receives less material from the comics, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains, where is the DVD?!
