I started watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another idiotic plane disaster movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most TV movies. He could have easily made his debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, including veterans Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga does one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Leeves of Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is convincing everywhere. In fact, the final hour is so full of twists and suspense that you can not leave your seat for a second. If you get the chance to see this movie, invest the time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
