"I just wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain." This is an excellent movie. It should have been reclassified to PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first film and the greatest. The follow up sucked. But I have not seen it for years, so here's what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) has to juggle the love conquest of his life, Apollonia (herself), keeping her band together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in her family. But his rival band (The Time Like Them) is ruining his life. As Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday night fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Very good. Rent, laugh and cry and if you like, buy.
