This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen on television. The first season was hilarious, just like most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the end. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut into people's imaginations, often portraying the characters from famous TV shows or movies from the '70s. It's a rare show in which I enjoyed all the characters (with the exception of the final season. .. too late to try to develop a new character and made it was not so funny). Red's foot in his comments never aged, nor Kelso's stupidity. Bravo the fox for keeping such a good show for so long, even for a long time.
