For the life of me, why did this movie receive a R?! While it's about meat-eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a good family movie - at least if your kids are 10 or older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- albeit a bit skewed! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the style of the film is definitely geared towards children (much like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - but some idiots slapped him! Believe me, most kids have seen violence worse than that and it seems ridiculous to make the public think that it is an adult-only movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a parallel world. While fashions, cars and customs appear around 1953, in this bizarre world there has been a fierce recent plague of zombies that resulted in the "zombie war" and major changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed combat and there is a cute scene at the end of the movie where the father gives his son a gun and tells him to put it in his backpack "just in case"! As for life outside of school, it is also very strange, as people have now learned that zombies ARE NOT ALL DIFFICULT! Heck, using shock collars and training, they can be turned into slaves who can do their housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be their "special friend." <br /> <br /> This film deals with a particular family that finally buys its first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes friends with the zombie. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - as he was forced years before to kill his own zombie dad and he still has not gotten over it !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie needs to be seen by a much wider audience.
