I saw this movie back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and out of the 14 movies I saw there I would rate this # 4. The 900+ theater was full and in the end it received a standing ovation. This was the classic Peter Falk if you are a fan of Falk and showed a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the film seemed too long and too strange for me. I'm surprised that this has not been released in general. That was a lot better than most of the trash the big studios throw at you. Maybe very adult, as it was baby-boomer and senior audience. A lot of people could relate to situations in this movie. This will probably enjoy a rebirth several years from now when people look back on this film and consider it a kind of jewel. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
