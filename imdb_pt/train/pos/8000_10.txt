... do not read any summary of the plot because, in words, the plot may seem trivial, brain dead and meaningless. The film is great, the performance of Denzel and Dakota (she goes to heaven, trust me) are simply fabulous, and the plot is mind-boggling. In fact, "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is based only on real facts and some characters are not fictitious, a fact that adds up to the shock I had during and after the movie. If you like both actors and somewhat insane movies, you still have not watched your favorite ... Trust me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is incredible, see, rent, buy or whatever ... just do not miss it
