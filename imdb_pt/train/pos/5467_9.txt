In my opinion, this has to be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. She was just one of the few actors, then and now, who could say more with a single glance than with a whole page of dialogues. And I was lucky enough to see the original uncensored movie with the extra 4 minutes of extra footage. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who can barely hold the job for her father in her illegal underground. His only link to anything is his good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African-American (and having a white woman as the best friend of a black woman in the 1930s was as controversial as the subject of this film), and Lily is not, they have a special bond. And this is not sexual. Only two women were trapped, or pushed, into a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies, and she does not know what to do, she is told that she has the power to get out and get what she wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the main point of this movie. Then "they" had to ruin the last few minutes. So until the last minutes of the movie, it's a great movie and worth watching. The film's "lesson" is still as valid today as it was then, and I'm sure 100 years from now. Women, it's horrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.
