This movie was another passage into adulthood for a gay man, and how he should handle everyone. Her mother is depressed, her younger sister is a pain, her older sister is somewhat accepted. The relationship looks good with your boyfriend / exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy runs over and says he really does not mean anything. Our young gay goes crazy and ends up in the little box and eventually leaves, leaving his new lover and starting over. We stayed with him starting again and seeing, not participating, happiness. So maybe things will be better for him in the future. The ending was kind of bad, but the whole movie was totally realistic and so I'll let this real end escape with a high rating.
