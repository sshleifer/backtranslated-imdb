Once again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the screen in the movie Black Mask. In this film, Li plays Tsui, a fugitive from a super-soldiers program that seeks to recover the humanity that the program took from him. To do this Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires him to clear the problems of his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super-soldier program escaped at the same time as Tsui, but want to equate the world instead of finding inner peace. Thus, Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This movie screams across the screen at a frenetic pace and never lets its audience go. Martial arts are incredible, but because they use wires they may not be appreciated as much as the American public deserves. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and require good acting performances because they deal with psychological and physical conflicts, then the Black Mask is for you. I'm happy to see that some of Jet Li's films are finally being released in the United States and are eager to see how the changes that this release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. This is one of Li's best movies, come out and watch it on May 14 when it's released in the United States.
