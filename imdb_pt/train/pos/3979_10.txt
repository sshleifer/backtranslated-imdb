I wish all fans of this documentary would know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm so proud of him. This VH1 miniseries shows the drug culture in the last 30 years and my uncle worked hard on it. The amount of time and effort I've watched you put into this documentary and the book that started it all (I can not find my way home) makes it much better to watch it on TV. I know he loves what he does and does well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he himself did, and the incredible additions he adds to the commentary. From music to videos and everything, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of those who lived. I appreciate any comments about this from those who liked (and did not like) and would love to hear from the fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
