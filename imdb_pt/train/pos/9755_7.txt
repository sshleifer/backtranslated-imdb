The last time I saw the movie I was around seven, so my opinions may be tired over time. At the time, I liked the filming that changed between cartoons and live action. At the time, I was saddened by the blue camel and its sad life. I also felt joy when, after Captain Contagious kidnapped the heroine (a princess or toy shepherdess), the tables were facing him. Unfortunately the producers have never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so all I have are memories of twenty years. I'm sure that if I saw the film again, I would consider it cheesy and mellow, but I really enjoyed the film at the time.
