For those who think of Dame May Witty as the gentle and slightly crazy old lady of Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this movie requires an adjustment. Here she is anything but gentle or extravagant. Instead, his son, George Macready, is the nut. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise your eyes light up and no furniture cushions in the house are safe. We now know what he has in mind for Nina Foch's prey if he can just get out of the mother's dominating hand. <br /> <br /> A really tight little woman in distress movie that keeps suspense everywhere. The script never deviates from Foch's dilemma. She is held prisoner in a large, old gothic house on the edge of a rough sea. They will kill her, but why? Your situation does not make sense. The tension increases as she tries one escape trick after another, but even strangers appear against her. We begin to feel her helplessness and her paranoia when the world moves away from her. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so. So also watch Foch run subtly through a range of emotions without going overboard. Witty also shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how she can manage to keep her crazy son on the line. My only reservation is the climax which seems very artificial considering the time of the events. However, it's a good and stressful way to spend a little over an hour courtesy of Columbia Studios.
