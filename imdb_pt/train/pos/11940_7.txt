Like a stubborn baseball, this movie is contrary to what I expect in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action, believable characters, and an original storyline. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds in the last two. "Angels" tells the story of Roger and J.P., two foster children in Anaheim who are passionate about baseball but looking for a family with the Angels, struggling to attract fans and win games. Pushed by the promise of his drowsy father that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant, Roger asks for some heavenly help, and gets it in the form of diamond-dwelling spirits intent on reversing the downward spiral of the franchise. And when short-george coach George Knox (played by Danny Glover) begins to believe what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to change their season - and Roger and JP find something to believe. Glover in particular performance, and Tony Danza, playing a pitcher, also does well, although clearly have ZERO idea of ​​how to get out of the game!
