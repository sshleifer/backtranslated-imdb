I hoped this movie was decent and possibly clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him so far) played an incredibly good leader; He was so sincere and romantic, me and my friend who saw the movie with me totally in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I liked before (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me appreciate her even more. Her performance was fantastic, I could not even say she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the cast was perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally successful; DeNiro as that gay pirate ... priceless, invaluable. I laughed so much in that scene that Septimus comes on the ship ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as the snippy mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and malicious comments throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was funny (but not a slap!), romantic, special effects were not all that frequent, but when they were, they were great; the appearances of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Promised Princess or even the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> He kept my interest all the time and I'm going to buy the DVD when I leave!
