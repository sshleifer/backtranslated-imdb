I was young to know about Prince, but in recent years I've seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee and I thought they were cool, but I did not want to buy a T-shirt I did not know about. Then one Saturday it happened and I decided to watch it. I did not know what the movie would be before watching, but it was great when I found out. In the movie prince was not known like prince, but like "the boy". All the performances were great for me, but my favorites were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki and I would die for you. All the songs connected to what was happening during the movie, when his mother and father were always fighting with the song, when doves cried, described what he was feeling. I also like how smart the prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked it when Prince and Appallonia met for the first time at the club and he got behind her standing up and then once she turned around he disappeared! great movie and now I can not even find one of these t-shirts :(
