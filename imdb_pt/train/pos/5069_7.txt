The movie is more about Pony than Gray Owl. It is also about the aborigines, Canada, the English, the gray owl aunts and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent history. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, more like a book, that raises interesting questions about identity and cultural values. The main scene is Gray Owl admitting his imposture to Pony and his reaction. <br /> <br /> Some comments on user ratings. Note that user ratings are bipolar groupings in 5 and 7; It is not for everyone, but it has strong followers. This film is underestimated and neglected, but will be noticed in the coming years. In addition, few women watched the film, but rated it more than men. Has it been marketed correctly? <br /> <br />
