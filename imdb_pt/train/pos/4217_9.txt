It is always rewarding when a detective covers up a case and the criminal is taken to the book. In that case, the climax gives me even more pleasure. Seeing the smug smug wipe from Abigail Mitchell's face as she realizes that her victim has left the "deathbed testimony" that leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Please understand: as long as I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, your character really, * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way, doing an act of little girl that is embarrassing to a woman her age. Worse, she has now established herself as a judge, jury, and executioner against her dead niece's husband. <br /> <br /> When Columbo is getting close, she tries to infuriate him by manipulating him to do an impromptu. speech for an audience of high-class ladies. He turns the table to perfection by uttering a warm and humane speech about the realities of police work. <br /> Nothing can distract Columbus from the pursuit of justice. Abby's last call to his good nature is rejected because he has too much respect for not doing his job well. Here's a situation you can not avoid Mrs. Mitchell!
