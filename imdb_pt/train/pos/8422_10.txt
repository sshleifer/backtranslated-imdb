An extra is called to play a general in a film about the Russian Revolution. However, it is not an ordinary extra. He is Serguis Alexander, the former commander-in-chief of the Russian armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene, which suffered professional and personal tragedies, to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander. Now may be the time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. This is a powerful film with Von Sternberg's meticulous direction, providing the greatest irony of Alexander's character in every possible way. Jannings earned his Oscar for the role with a very touching performance playing the general at his peak and in his deepest valley. Powell lends a sinister support as the vengeful director and Brent is perfect in his role with his face and movements showing as much expression as the love of Jannings. All around brilliance. Evaluation, 10.
