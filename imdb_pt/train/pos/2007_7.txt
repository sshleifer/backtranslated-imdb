My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a real story for the vampires of the first John Carpenter, but I do not care what AMEI. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. He really made me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the plot, there should have been more in the movie. There should have been a continuation of the film that followed the story line of the films and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampire films. I really liked the clothes people wore and the scenery they chose in Mexico. I liked what old Mexico was like and not the new Mexico. with mud houses and old-fashioned churches. I was a bit confused with vampires and how they were able to walk in churches, but it was cool how they did not follow Dracula's vampire rules.
