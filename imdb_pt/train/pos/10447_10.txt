There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in a lifetime but for some reason or another we remember these people for the rest of our lives. These unique friendships occur between people with long distances and there are always some natural reasons why we do not find these people anymore. We do not always know their names because we are never introduced to each other and sometimes even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how ordinary humanity makes casual friends and we like to keep it as such because getting together can ruin good memories, or we do not know them. We're too scared to check this out. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' got me watching. I never intended to watch, but as the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I took a look at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect, but the young couple did not either. They had time to argue with each other until sunrise and anything could happen before they had to part. I think this movie has had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet lives on at least once or twice. It makes us think of all those people we meet only once in our lives.
