I always wanted David Duchovney to go into the movie business, and finally he did, and he made me proud. This movie lived up to what I expected. Duchovney interpreted his character very well, being able to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder that we are accustomed to. So I give him extra credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing this particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you do not get tired of throughout the movie because it never ceases to amaze you. He has weak and strong points, making the story even more believable. I also really enjoyed the narration, I added to the story a good deal, and I had some memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This movie also had an animated score. I recommend this to anyone who likes drama, and does not mind blood.
