SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I really am in the minority in this movie, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it's definitely engaging and a ride full of adrenaline. I definitely thought it was worth at least a grade 7. <br /> <br /> Maybe the reason I liked it is because I did not see the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this, the strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and therefore have little to compare. This was not a masterpiece, but I got into it a lot and really made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were some things I liked about it. One of them was the cast of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was excellent and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. As most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be great and he was. This was a big role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it was made for television. I had no idea that this was the case when I watched it. It sure looked like a great movie and I would never have guessed it was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very absorbing. I'm not into action movies, but I was sucked into it. Besides, it was so much more than an action movie in which there was drama, mysticism, a love story, peculiar people in every way you became. (I did not even recognize Priestly.) And it was moving. This was not a great movie, but it's watchable. <br /> <br /> And then there's the end. It has a strong impact and if you are involved in the story up to that point, it is very difficult not to be paralyzed in the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and although I am highly skeptical about how that would be possible, it is a film and realism is not an ingredient that is always present when we make a movie. <br /> <br /> So I have to say that I found the ending incredibly unrealistic, but very touching in a manipulative way, which I usually do not like, but for some reason, it's almost forgivable in this movie. Of course, many things were just props for the plot (could the villains have been more stereotyped?) But the creators got a lot right, even if they missed a lot too. However, having said that, I admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original would hate this version because although I did not see the original, I saw many original movies that I loved being redone with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually the sequel.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of high quality. <br /> <br /> People compared this to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road version of "Legends of the Fall" and also "Thelma and Louese"? I'm sure I felt the touch of both films (of which I'm a fan). I do not think, however, that this was a great movie. It was better than average for me, but far from great. But it was an absorbing movie, full of adrenaline and touching, with excellent cast of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
