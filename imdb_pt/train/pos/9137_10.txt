This is the only movie I've seen Prince in, but it does not matter. And I thought he was great at singing, I was wrong. This is probably your best performance. The music is great. That's why he won an Oscar in 1984 for best music in a movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammies on his resume. Although the curse disrupts the movie (just make sure there are no small children or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should really go out and get that movie that your collection is not complete unless you have that movie in it. What more could I say except to go and get this movie now!
