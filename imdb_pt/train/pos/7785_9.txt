I just watched 2 Pang Brothers, The Eye and One Take only movies. When I watched The Eye, I was kind of disappointed with these two guys, that I had heard good words about them before. This film (The Eye) has a very bad script, especially the ending (childish, clich√© and very coincident in my opinion), but still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to see One just picked up and did not disappoint again. Still great photo, stunning image, MTV style editing, cool music and this time the story has lots of indie, logical and beautiful spirit, you will see some small holes in the plot but it does not cause any problem with the plot. The only problem about this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
