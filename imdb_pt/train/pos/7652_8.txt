The acting is fantastic. The story is incredible. The script - wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes it is slow and has mostly talked about, but the whole story of all their lives and how it is told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to hear every little thing to learn more about this scary and tragic story. I personally am reading the book from which the film is based and it has shown me even more light on this story and answers some questions that went unanswered in the film. I'll also read the Song of the Expresso, which is the other half of Gilmore's story. This film made me think a lot about the phrase "penetrating the other side of the mirror". You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is from a punk band who wrote a song about what it would be like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and while you listen, which is after the last time Mikal sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a bit differently, if you were just here the song itself. This movie opened my eyes this way and many others. I highly recommend this movie (and the book).
