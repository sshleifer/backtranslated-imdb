Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country has ever had, showed that he was equally at home with movies. With "Panic in the Streets," Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, perhaps with his masterpiece, "On the Waterfront," though both films share only the water scene because they are different visions about different subjects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan was filmed in New Orleans. Daniel Fuchs's adaptation of the stories of Edna and Edward Anhalt, which are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places no tourist dared to see when visiting "The Big Easy". One of the great assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography of Joseph MacDonald, which shows New Orleans at its best. Also the music of Alfred Newman and the music of Billie Holiday give the works a nice touch. This movie might have been filmed in New York, or in another big northern town because it presents us with characters who speak more like "broklynese" than perhaps a Southern accent that one can hear in that part of the parents. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, burns on the screen every time Nobody sees him. He was so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, whom he does not know, is afflicted with a fatal illness. Blackie, comfort this man by caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the oily hair of the dying man with abandon. Remarkable also, was the fact that Palance and Mostel seem to be doing their own action scenes, something so refreshing because both actors make it look real. <br /> <br /> The film also features a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later he and his wife discuss how it looks like they can not make ends meet with their salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person, is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, like the wife, looks like a suburban Connecticut woman. <br /> <br /> The film is enjoyable thanks to the direction of Mr. Kazan and the excellent cast working on the film.
