Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are "Three Smart Girls" in this 1936 Universal film, which features Deanna Durbin for the movie audience. He is also starring Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, who now live in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear that their father (Winninger) is remarrying. Having not seen him in 10 years and knowing that his mother still loves him, they embark on a ship to America, with the help of the nanny / sitter, determined to disrupt the marriage. Realizing that the intended, called "Precious" (Barnes) is nothing more than a gold digger aided and aided by his mother (Brady), they organize so that she is presented / displayed to a rich count. This is organized by the parent accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls confuse him with a real count (Milland). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is a delightful movie, not cloying or overly sugary, with some enjoyable performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The girls are beautiful and they all do a good job. The emphasis, of course, lies on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a young woman is much more uniform than it would be when she was an adult - she has no problem with sharp notes, as she later did because she put a lot of weight into the middle voice. She sings a delicious "Il Bacio" at a police station. <br /> <br /> One of the cool things about the movie is seeing his father, played by Charles Winninger, not wanting his kids around-until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes, like the prospector, is not that young, but the girls' mother looks there, so the inference was probably the older man in search of his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he sought in his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin the big growth of stars here - she has the last chance in the movie. Ray Milland at this time was still paying off his debts, and it will probably be a surprise to even film the fans as he is young and attractive. <br /> <br /> A lot of fun and of course, this led to a sequel and great stardom for Deanna.
