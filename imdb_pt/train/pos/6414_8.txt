I was curious as to how critics reacted to this exciting and inspiring film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was disappointed to find that the pompous peanut gallery that is our country's film critic gave the film an average of 43% or "Rotten"). ) ranking. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if this movie does not move you, you have no heart. (It's interesting to note that the same movie on the same site had 74% audience). <br /> <br /> Not that the opinion of critics is so important to me. After all, I can not think of a more useless and excessive profession. Some schmo get paid to go to the cinema (that hard life) and does the same thing that everyone does: form an opinion. But these idiots have a way of coming across as if their opinion is more important than yours, and worse, they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I'm going to make sure that this movie is old-fashioned (well, except for the f-bombs), syrupy and a little predictable ... after all, you know from the outset that Cuba Gooding Jr., who plays the real-life hero of the Navy, Carl Brashear, will triumph (eventually) at every turn simply for the way he faces: determined and brave; of strong and optimistic will. <br /> <br /> But his performance and De Niro's (like Billy Sunday, a character made up of several real-life people) are so strong, so inspiring, that you'll be at your feet cheering on many of the movie's scenes , especially the court's climax. You'd have to be a real dick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes. Like the movie critics of our nation. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a stuttering dive student who becomes friends with Brashear from Gooding. If someone has already seen "Higher Education," this character fully rescues this character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this confirms what I've always felt: do not listen to the critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
