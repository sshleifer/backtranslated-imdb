I rented this movie on DVD without knowing anything about it, part of a winter marathon watching a movie every night. After several American adventure and action movies (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors struck me as a brilliantly original film. The story is complete nonsense, but I found the sincerity, goodwill and total lack of irony of the movie, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, special effects are not as technically as perfect as those produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are wisely more interested in color, composition and motion than realism and many of the plans are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters are in steep rock towers, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess's warrior sails through the skies behind her sword as bright as a hot-looking missile. And the colors explode from one shot to another, used to express emotions instead of representing reality. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same simplicity and frankness of the comic characters, not offering great depth in themselves, but referring to the archetypes. which resonate more deeply. Physically, several of the actors are incredibly handsome. They play their roles directly, without irony or cunning, and so are believable. <br /> <br /> The strangest of all, despite the clumsiness of the plot and the fine characterizations, I found myself very close to the tears in the end, I moved. by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and by the director's uncontrollably original and good-hearted vision. <br /> <br />
