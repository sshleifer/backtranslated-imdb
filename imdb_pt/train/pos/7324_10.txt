My personal favorite horror movie. From the first trace to the final turn of the story, this is Carpenter's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween night of 1963, little Michael Meyers kills his big sister. All eve of 1978, Michael escapes of the sanatorium of Smith's Grove. Halloween night, Michael came home to murder again. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael chases and kills nannies. There are no bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's fearful atmosphere that generates tension. Like any great horror movie, events are telegraphed well in advance, but still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience a chance to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark lighting, the long, constant-camera shots, and (most importantly) that damn song creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in the movies. There is a body count, but compared to the amount of slashers thereafter, it is relatively small. That and most of the murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but in not knowing. <br /> <br /> The performance is good for roundelay. PJ Soles provides most of the films with limited humor (and one of the best killings), Nancy Loomis performs a decent performance and then there's the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and insecure, but you soon realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and insecure and not prepared for what she is facing. And, of course, there is the perfectly chosen Donald Pleasence, as the determined (perhaps somewhat unstable) dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has a damaging flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this movie so many years ago, almost countless clones, copies, thefts and imitators have appeared and stole (usually badly) the best pieces of movies until almost everything has become familiar. Combined with the changes to expectations and appetites of the public, lies a large part of the raw power of the diluted films. To truly enjoy it these days, it must be seen as it once was, as something unique. <br /> <br /> Never, however, I have no reservation in recommending this movie to anyone looking for a good scary time. Higher Regents. <br /> <br /> 10/10
