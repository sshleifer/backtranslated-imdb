I'll keep this short. I believe this is an extraordinary film. I see other reviewers who commented on the effect that is poorly written, poorly filmed, has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that is not real in his portrait of life. OK, so it may not be totally believable throughout its length, but this movie brings a message of hope that some others seem to have missed. I hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible things that happen in so many lives. Gang violence is real, right? That's right, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics may not like, but which, however, should be praised rather than denigrated. I watched this movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with the same pleasure and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be better and is not beyond being saved (well, not until 2008). 9 out of 10 from me to this. It's almost perfect in my opinion. JMV
