Man, I really love the new DVD that Universal has released. I've never seen SENTINEL so well since I had to put up with bad VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, there are no extras besides a trailer that looks much worse for wear. And AVOID the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. Anyway, the troubled fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to the haunted NYC sandstone, only to be more than just haunted. It is also a portal to hell and the Vatican holds an old blind priest (John Carradine) to watch over him and make sure devils and angels do not escape. <br /> <br /> This has a star full of old actors like Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc. as well as appearances of 80s stars including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum was mysteriously overdubbed) and Tom Berenger . And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to reciprocate when I had not seen where I'd seen him before. Pleasant scenes of Alison's blood slicing through the eyes and nose of the rotting corpse of her father who was possessed. by the devil. And there is an interesting ending in which disfigured and deformed people try to haunt Alison to commit suicide so she is not the next to guard the portal. It seems that Alison's troubled past makes her an excellent Vatican candidate to become the next sentry. <br /> <br /> A great and chilling 1970s classic by director Michael Winner that should not be overlooked. I also recommended it to those who want something a bit more imaginative than the usual teen slashers and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
