I'm a sucker for movies like this. Movies that take you back and allow you to relive your childhood. I am an adult now and have many grown up responsibilities like a mortgage, children, dogs, a wife and a huge amount of others. I like my life, but it's not as innocent and carefree as when I was twelve. Mike Binder's Indian Summer knows this and explores this as he was twelve years old. It brings back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. This brings you back to a time when you worry about your first kiss and wondering if you could end the camping marathon were important issues. Indian Summer is a fantastic movie and it is one that must be seen at least once a year just so you can sit and laugh ... and reminisce. <br /> <br /> The film stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as childhood friends being summoned back to Camp Tamakwa by their former Camp Counselor Chief, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou is played perfectly by Alan Arkin. He is a kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group. He is also all knowing and embodies the true spirit of a father figure and one who understands the simple things of life. He has a hard time relating to today's kids who need a strident walkman in their ears when they are in a place of immense beauty like Tamakwa. This is a camp that has moose roaming the camp, leaves of colors that God gave them and water as far as the eyes can see. Uncle Lou yearns for the days of old and asks his ex-campers to return to the camp to see one of them take over the camp. While they are together again, we can see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love might arise between them. <br /> <br /> When the adults return to the camp, it does not take long for them to act like children again as the typical camp games are played again. They take toilet paper out of the stalls, put the toothpaste in the sleeping bags and so on. All this is done hilariously and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, it's all very funny. <br /> <br /> But beyond joy, we can explore some very real adult emotions that anyone can relate to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins are overlooking a bay where they used to do kayaking as children. Pollak can not get over how small everything looks and Perkins finally tells him that the bay did not get smaller, they just got bigger. It does not make sense, but does subtly. We all grow up, we all move on and we all unfortunately can not live like we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Indian Summer is a character-driven film and written beautifully by Mike Binder, who actually participated in Tamakwa Camp Camp, as Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the film) and is his living memories and loving stories of their experiences feeding the film. There are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones as well. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it and it's a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
