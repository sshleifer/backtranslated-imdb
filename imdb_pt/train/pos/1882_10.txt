<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It's a throwback to the glitxy, romantic sterling comedies of the 1940s. But with a modern twist. The screen explodes with intelligence, charm, humor and tenderness, the cinematograpy is dazzling (NYC has never looked so handsome), and of course there is the cast! Dudley Moore transforms into the performance of his career as Loveable, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also melancholy and true. One of the best lines in the film is his poignant "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won a much-deserved Oscar for his splendid performance as Hobson, Arthur's valet and janitor. Although he considered a "take the money and play the role," he brings to the character all the talent, experience and bravery of an expert tragidian and a cunning comedian. The supporting cast is also out of the world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's daring Grandma Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic Mafioso. <br /> <br /> The result is also extremely memorable and complements the film perfectly. The only real problem with the movie is the ill-fated sequel it spawned.
