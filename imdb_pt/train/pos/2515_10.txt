Moon Child, starring the Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> In Mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, Sho, Sho's brother, Shinji, and Toshi, who steal and murder. to earn a living. In one of the robberies, Sho finds Hyde's vampire Kei burning in the sunlight. Through the grossness of events, the true nature of Kei is shown, but no one avoids it. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal Kei, who never changes, raised Sho, and the two have an extreme. close bond. Sho and Kei then find the son in an outrageous gun fight, and they quickly become friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time skips again and shows a grown Sho, this time without Kei. He also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through tragedy after the tragedy, this film plunges into the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It's a truly touching movie that is sad but beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think Gackt did a magnificent job. Hyde did an incredible job for a first timer. <br /> <br /> The scenes were beautiful, but the film had rare and short shots. <br /> <br /> In short, I must say this movie is incredible, touching, and I strongly recommend it.
