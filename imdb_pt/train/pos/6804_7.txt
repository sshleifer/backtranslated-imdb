Do not let my constructive criticism prevent you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic. This film was filmed on a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to do the due. For example England is portrayed as on the border with Germany.BY a wisp will Victoria and her mother are pulling Holiday to Germany from buggy ride alone.They arrived very fast. This probably could not be helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she is told that she is queen, she goes to the royal room, where court members bow to her, where are the British citizens outside the castle cheering for her new queen? Why does not she show herself on the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Where are the public aware of these imperfections? I wonder how the critics felt? During the scene of the inn she meets Prince Albert, but ISBN is not excited about it. During the meeting on the feeding side of the inn you hear music from famous old songs from the American Civil War, such as "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Old Black Joe." What? Songs of civil war in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider portrayed as Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Is Magna Shnieder playing her too? Is it Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well, that adds up to the camp. It is not wanting to satirize the story of Queen Victoria. This is the only reason why you should collect or view 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
