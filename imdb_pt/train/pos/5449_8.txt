Did you know that Anthony Kiedis, (singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) father is in this movie? Blackie Dammit, is Anthony's father. I noticed this after reading the autobiography of "Scar Tissue" Anthony, and saw a photo of his father. I thought, "Well, this guy kinda looks like that guy in that movie I saw in the '80s. So I read over and he said his dad was an actor who had a few small roles. Comparing with a Search on the net, I realized that he really is his father in the movie. It's funny, because nowhere in the book does he mention he's in this movie. Maybe his son was ashamed of his father's acting work in this movie, but he I think his father, Blackie, did a great job on the show.
