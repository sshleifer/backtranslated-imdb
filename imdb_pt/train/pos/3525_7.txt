Dude, this is a hard-to-find DVD. I could only find it in Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Well, yes. Not so much because it is a masterpiece of cinema, although directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on "read" Robert, but the list of credits of DVD Curt), or because it has a pair of figures known from other mysteries of the murder - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my curiosity of a decade over the film was finally met. Essentially, a respected but self-sufficient engineer (Alan Curtis) has been by his distant wife and is in a bar in New York with two tickets to the show in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the bench next to him and he politely invites her to join him in the musical review. She accepts, a little gloomy. The mopey bartender gives them both eyes when they leave. <br /> <br /> In the show, the stormy star realizes that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts from the stage in anger. The band's drummer, Cook, looks at the silent lady, but receives no response. Curtis takes the woman to his house and asks her name, but she does not give it, and she does not want to meet his. If she had been a devotee of Longfellow, she would have said something about ships that would pass at night. <br /> <br /> Ok, Curtis goes home and finds out that his wife was murdered in his absence. The police chief, Gomez, hands him over to the DA. His only alibi was that he was with a ghost lady whom no one else remembered - not the bartender, the Latin star, the cab driver ("Al Alp"), or the drummer - and even the lady herself. disappeared, it is impossible to dig it. <br /> <br /> Curtis is condemned and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez thought about things and decided that she is probably innocent, because no one with a brain would invent such a stupid story. He joins Curtis's lovely secretary, Ella Raines, in re-investigating the case informally. <br /> <br /> They visit the alleged witnesses again. The sinister bartender gets hit by a car, maybe accidentally, so he's out of the picture. The hot tempered Latina has left because the program has closed and she does not cooperate and ignores the origin of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real killer, but not before appearing in a scene in which he hits the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression that does not suggest intense focus, but a monstrous and orgasmic insanity. Her eyeballs roll to the ceiling, her mouth opens, her hammering frenzied. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> No one's performance is exceptional, but everyone is professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always dependable. The best performance, however, is probably the Franchot Tone. He's the real killer and he fakes his alibi. It is booked and artistic. Even when he passes out, it's decorous. I do not know how to put this precisely, but Tom seems to be thinking as well as simply doing his part. Alan Curtis, as an innocent engineer, is almost zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to a B figure. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it's considered classic. It really is your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man is run over and his hat ends up in a gutter with water running around him. His use of shadows is discreetly effective. <br /> <br /> Glad I understood.
