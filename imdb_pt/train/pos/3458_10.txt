Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was pure brilliance. Cassidy embodied arrogance, confidence, charm, and intelligence-all with a small condescending, malignant grin on her face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (having appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance, is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down. Steven Spielberg did an incredible camera job (yes, there were some camera shadows on the actors at times) capturing the nuances and jokes at different and intriguing angles between Columbus and Franklin. In addition, the panoramic and tight jacks in Big Bear Lake, California (Franklin cabin home) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode then you owe it to yourself - It's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly contagious. His death in 1976, at age 49, was very sad and indeed very tragic - he certainly had his best years ahead. Rest in peace Jack, you will live for all eternity through your great work.
