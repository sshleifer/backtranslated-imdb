Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be with virtually no budget. All you need is an intelligent script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW delivers all that and more. Nic Cage plays a former Marine, wounded in Lebanon, who is reduced to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job in an oil field because of his injured knee. He plays the Red Rock and is mistaken for bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not so menacing - but still mean) by a Texas killer. <br /> <br /> He pays to kill his wife and make it look like stealing. Only when he gets there, just to check on her. She offers him double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get out of town with his free money and let the lovers of sparring. But a series of setbacks and setbacks results in him moving in and out of the Red Rock, going back and forth. Eventually this leads to a disagreement with Lyle from Dallas (a cheeky and somewhat friendly Dennis Hopper), the real REAL man from Texas who volunteers to help without knowing that he is making the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW has never had a great release, so most audiences have discovered it in video or cable TV shows. Viewing it in such a way may seem like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. The smooth, slow direction, the soundtrack and howling wind would have contributed to a big movie in theaters, but the best you can do these days is watch the DVD on a big HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point in the movie that I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's annoying femme fatale annoying doque-ish hairstyle. I certainly would not fall in love with her, but if you assume that Nic Cage's character belongs to militant lesbians, then you'll accept that anyway.
