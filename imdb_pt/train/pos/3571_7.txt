I've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. This should be a cult favorite! The best sentence: "Your dress is really cool!" says the prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like her stepmother. I also like the cars and motorcycles of the 1950s. The melancholic prince is a great starting point for the typical swashbuckler. He tries to stay cool but can not hide his love for the fairytale princess. His slipper is not glass (more true to the original story), but the Cinderella loses, however, gets back from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it is not shown over and seems to be almost impossible to get. We hope Blockbuster or Amazon will start stocking it soon.
