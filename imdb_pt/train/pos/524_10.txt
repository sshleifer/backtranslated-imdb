I saw this movie years ago on late night television. At that time, it passed the title of "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a boy, I remember being deeply moved by the story and surprised by the visual effects of the trial in court (those who saw the subject know what I'm talking about). Such an imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is up there with the greatest classics of all time: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and the Wind Took. This film is rated extremely high by the IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; more than 84% rated it 8 or more than 10. I was surprised that it was not listed in the top 250 movies until I realized that few watched / rated this movie compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1) I can buy it, and 2) others discover this hidden treasure.
