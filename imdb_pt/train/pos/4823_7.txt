It's a complicated thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and imperious, and on the other hand, she has to show vulnerability in a difficult situation, as well as muster up the courage and resolution to overcome the difficulties, since almost every movie about queens this line of basic storyline. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is pretty radiant like Victoria, but it's not as full a performance as I'd like, nor blame her. I can not help feeling that this is an adaptation of Mills & Boon's novel compared to a darker and dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. Blunt can not run the queen's range of emotions, at least not at all, since she is, you know, young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of film director. He made the last C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and boosted him to fame. It was a very different film, but I remember it looked beautiful and this is probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this was from Julian Fellowes, and although I really liked his Gosford Park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. Soon I got lost with all the government policy. Perhaps it was less enveloping because there was no potential decapitation of the monarchy. I'm just saying.
