Of all the break-dance / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street movie is unquestionably the best. The story follows a DJ, his breakdancing younger brother, a graffiti artist and a showbiz promoter one winter as they try to get out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The acting is not always on the same level and the characters are not totally exhausted, but they are more than made up for by real dialogues, a plausible storyline, fantastic dance sequences and a timeless hip-hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this film was shot in the cradle of breakdancing ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!"), And features appearances from break dance parents, Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata . Rock Steady Crew offers the best scene of the film when they dominate a dance battle in the first 80's break club, the Roxy. A must see for hip-hop lovers.
