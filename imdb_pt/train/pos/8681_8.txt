This cartoon is short on plot, but it is visually stunning work. There will be very, very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is unbelievably light underground gnomes are responsible for the return of spring every year, still must face a winter is not yet ready to remove the. The gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot as it is. But this drawing is not about the plot, it's about the color and the animation. The visuals are exceptional. In 1936, this bright color was still a novelty and there is an incredibly inspired work here. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through the pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of tubes aligned in line, from the shortest to the highest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it appear that the row is a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The visuals of the battle between the emerging vegetation and the winter storm that refuses to go quietly are extremely well executed. These types of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for, but they probably also helped bring MGM to the start because that design probably surpassed the budget and MGM finally decided that it could better control costs if the animation were managed by someone a bit more aware of the cost of what Harman and Ising were. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful cartoon and worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the 1930s characters. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
