After all these years, I still consider this series the best example of documentary production of World War II. Interviews with many participants from all countries set it apart from any other project. Would it be great to see a contemporary documentary filmmaker (Ken Burns?) Approach this subject and try to gather information from veterans before they all have disappeared. With modern technology to enhance the old archive images and much information that has been discovered since 1974, when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. The History Channel did some good shows dealing with many aspects of World War II, but an expansive series like World At War has not been tried successfully since the original. If you are interested in this season, do not miss this series. It is necessary to see.
