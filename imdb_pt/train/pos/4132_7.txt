A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". He marks the first couple of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before that little film about uncontrollable passion in the English marshes of the nineteenth century. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suitable for crazy comedy, everything flows very well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in the hotel suite of divorce lawyer Logan (Olivier) through an English fog that prevents travel. She does everything possible to annoy him - but in the crazy way the films go, he falls in love with her. And she falls in love with him. But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all she leaves Oliver on a note) is thought by Olivier to be a married woman. To make matters worse, and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife, whom dear Larry thinks should be Oberon! There is an interesting dialogue about the battle of sex and a fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not very confident with the comedy, but in true Olivier he is a consummate professional and delivery. And he deals with the twists and turns, perhaps not with ease, but with gusto. Oberon was not a great actress as an actress, but she was usually competent enough and, despite her reputation for not liking her, worked well with Olivier. This was shot early in the Technicolor that looks very primitive nowadays (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the impression needs to be clean.
