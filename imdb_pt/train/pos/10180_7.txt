Indian directors have difficulties, They have to compete with films like "Laggan", where 11 castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas," an unhappy alien return filled with binge drinking into oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors unrelated to anyone's feelings or feelings - though they live in a misery adorned with tapestry and red pomp. But to make a good movie, you have to walk a tightrope to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum fights, preferably involving a stupid "Bollywood" chief actor who is marginally beautiful. So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale from Leonine Village Head, which in its own words "defending your village" is considered a violent or very masculine film for a male audience. There are very few actors who can convey anger and the pathetic as Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar leaves you in her patio and watches him flock and mock the politician as his loyal admirers burst into laughter with every word of satire thrown at him while his daughter is taking a shower of her grandson. This is a scene so authentic you can reach the countryside. India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old acting school which is an endangered breed in Hindi Films. The violence portrayed is an intricate part of the narrative with Song & Dances, for the curious without which the films do not sell, a sad but true state of affairs. Faster this changes better for "Bollywood". All said and done, this is a good movie.
