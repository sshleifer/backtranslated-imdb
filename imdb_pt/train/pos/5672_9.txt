In this part of the series, Edmund Blackadder is imprisoned in the regency period in Britain (during the later part of the government of George III). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer - as instead of royalty, he is a servant of the very, very thick George IV (the price ruler). Unlike George IV's historical accounts, this is as bright as a tomato, and as a result Blackadder is able to take advantage of it and plan the contents of his heart. The only big difference in style between this and the previous ones is that the series ends on a very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. Other than that, all the usual elements of the story are there and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not appropriate for children due to their raw language and adult situations.
