I read the book and I must say that this film remains true to form. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as a leader, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the neighbor on the side. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think I'm going to buy the book and the movie for my collection. The suspense keeps growing until the end of the weather, the twist you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Also, what's interesting are the actors in the movie - you would not recognize them if you had not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum excels as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, which is understated, but great.
