What would happen when a depressed police officer works with a psychiatrist on probation? It can be a lot of fun ... This movie established a reference in the action / comedy genre of Argentine cinema. Dear characters, probable story and a rhythm that between laughs has some emotion. I recommended it for a nice time of entertainment. Peretti and Luque join forces to fight a cold and daring enemy at a time when it's hard to trust anyone. This movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin "Analyze me", but not in the same way, with nothing to envy. And if you like to get to know Bs.as there, where some scenes from downtown and downtown.
