Starring a primitive Peter Finch as lord of the mansion on some God-forsaken plantation, where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen, staying in the midday sun and going crazy. Well, eventually, they do, after the outbreak of typhoid or cholera, of course, and much mayhem follows. Taylor replaced sick Vivien Leigh in this panela / adventure movie. When the elephants invaded the house and arrested Liz on the grand staircase, I still feel shivers. Thank God, Dana Andrews is around to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!
