It is worth seeing this film for visual beauty and moving action alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and artists (both reunited in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are doomed to be relegated to subservience roles in China. This makes the unlikely link between an aged street artist and a young girl is even stronger as a triumph over the native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell with emotion made unnecessary by the performance of the actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory summer action films.
