I'm glad someone made a movie about how difficult it is to risk your heart a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - adorable, fun and gives you a good feel around your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not yet been used. The cast is perfectly selected, although Scott Wolf does not look like a father to an eight year old boy even when he is wearing a suit. So the sparks are in all right places, the cast support is lovely and although you can predict the whole movie, you do not want to switch the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
