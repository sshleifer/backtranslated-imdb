Now that's more like it! The first movie had some dubious dialogues and some weaker acting but it seems the team behind it put their stuff together for the sequel and released a solid, completely entertaining, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats. Seriously, this is full of good stuff, full of creativity, and it's less of a fake in the 1980s movies at the same time. The scenes in hell are great, just like the scenes in the sky. There is no shortage for the crazy adventure that this promises, and you will never see another movie like this. Even the last act of the movie is not as bad as the first, being generally exciting and enjoyable in its extremely cliche repertoire of family fun. And even Keanu Reeves, despite having seen about 30, is not so bad here. It sounds like a good deal to me.
