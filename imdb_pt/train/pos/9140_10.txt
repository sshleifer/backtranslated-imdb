I love this movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and has my heart since I remember. Prince is so tight in this movie. I went to a special Purple Rain performance last night and it was like a show that I was happy to see some real fans because this movie is so underrated, it really is one of the biggest movies of all time. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest in the city, and he has his eye on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt that purple is my favorite color. I can thank "The Kid" for this. So if you have not seen this then you need to do it asap. This is a classic - 4ever!
