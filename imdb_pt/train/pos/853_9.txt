"The Matador" is starring Pierce Brosnan as a burned killer. He is the James Bond who went to seed, in very tight clothes, gaudy, chains of gold and an ugly haircut. Our fighting killer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his courage. Staying at the same hotel is a nice lucky businessman, Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), also trying to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques, which he demonstrates in a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and appears in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard did the Q & A after this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard, too, was unlucky. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejecting recent screenplays, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character that no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (There's life after Bond!) He has a wonderful talent for self-deprecating comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay up to the final credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more Richard Shepard projects.
