"Burning Paradise" is a combination of the action of the neo-Shaw Brothers and the urban cynicism of Ringo Lam. When you watch the movie, they may feel that the fighting scenes are of a mediocre nature, but it does not matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. This great movie has both !! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in a scenario of "Raiders of the Lost Ark." However, these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations you can see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys fight to the death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that anyone can die at any time, there is no way to hold on. Too bad they do not make movies like that more often.
