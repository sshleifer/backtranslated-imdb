This would be a surefire classic if they chose ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is a horrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, shocking, etc. He stinks. It seemed that at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and practically made him jump like a monkey to make his solo scenes a bit funny. <br /> <br /> He is the only notable disadvantage (there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise. Best comedy to come in Bollywood from Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy performed on the shoulders of a brilliant script and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably your best performance to date. He better be a shoe for the best comedian in all the awards. AK has always been good at comedy but he takes it to a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and just the way it offers all the lines. It's a great performance. The crowded theater was going crazy for almost the entire length of the movie and I guess I've never seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the US. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have a "lead" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT + Beautiful girls which I found to have done a good job. I'm sure everyone is making their debut. Paresh Rawal is solid as ever, though his routine runs out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying ego (sick of his exaggerated act in all the movies). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's funnier than in the Entry, and that's a lot. It could have been even better if they had chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
