This was a wonderful film. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the actors' performances were great. I had to think about the movie for a long time. I think every student should see this movie to think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because it showed me how love can be strong. I wish I could be as strong as a woman. I really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the movie with Der Untergang, The Pianist. If you put these three films together, you'll have a great view of what happened during the war. We must remember something like war forever.
