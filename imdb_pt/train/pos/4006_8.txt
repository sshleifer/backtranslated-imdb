[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for whom the notion that their parents have sex makes her terribly uncomfortable. It came to my mind as I reflected on the public's reaction to "The Mother." People gasped as May (Anne Reid) squirmed passionately in bed with her youngest lover, Darren (Daniel Craig), or later saw sexually explicit drawings in May. I doubt the audience was horrified by the nudity or the content of the drawings, as much as it made them uncomfortable to see a struggling 60-year-old woman enjoying sex. Writer Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundry", "My Son the Fanatic") proves yet again why he is among the most compelling storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic. Your story is not easy to accept. This family drama is not a movie you can claim to enjoy watching because it is raw, complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. However, it is powerfully good. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed "Notting Hill", of all things) create a non-sentimental, painfully and superbly represented portrait of an older woman who realizes, after all, in these years, she can and should still enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a wonderfully epic moment, when his son, Bobby, asks him not to be difficult, May retorts, "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, in fact? <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn in May. It is subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often at the same time. Watch Reid when May watches Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous encounter. Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. At the most devastating moment of the film, May falls to his knees in front of Darren, willing to do anything for him, just asking him to be gentle. This is a tremendously courageous performance by a remarkable actress. I liked the use of Michell's natural sound, especially when May and Toots first came to Bobby's place. He perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the irreverent way in which his own family receives them. <br /> <br /> This movie has sometimes reminded me of the honesty and crudeness of Mike Leigh's work, except "The Mother" bears a bit of optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My only complaint: Michell's decision to give May and Darren the first love scene, an almost extravagant sensibility. Lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain floats gently in the breeze. And the only sound is May in the spasms of passion. The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely involve the role of Darren, open the way so fearlessly to these roles that it is unfair to hide the almost primitive energy of their characters from the audience . Especially since Michell has no scruples about making the sex scenes later visceral. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have immensely nice characters. We sympathize with May, but she also causes her daughter to suffer. But I doubt that Kureishi wanted his people to like his story. Your point, I believe, was to unmask a family that is already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. It is unshakable in its sincerity and, finally, unforgettable.
