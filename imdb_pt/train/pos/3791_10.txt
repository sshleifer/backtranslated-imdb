Our song is a wonderful example of making passionate films in their best aesthetic style. It is, in fact, a true marvel of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young girls from the inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their adult life will force each of them to make a number difficult to change choices that are likely to redefine who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate in the next few years. <br /> <br /> The writing / direction of Jim McKay is graceful and organized. There is no sentimental sentimentality and gratuitous, nor are there clich√©s solutions in this film. What we see here sometimes seems to be a true heart. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants of this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit for the movie's spirit goes to its top actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is unbelievably powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to disregard, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or emotionless. In fact, his silent charm, his sense of instinctive dignity, and his crude, sometimes unconventional intelligence throughout the film are absolutely fascinating. It would be necessary to be completely "out of touch" or completely indifferent to the adolescent's behavior of losing the resounding authenticity of what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Likewise, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, praises the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our Song is a film that can not be forgotten - by anyone. of any age.
