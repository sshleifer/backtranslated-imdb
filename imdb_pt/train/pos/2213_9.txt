Wow, this was a completely captivating film I could not believe I got up so late to watch it but came in late Oz I started to watch I could not stop had a full range of very good cast members even wow Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many other best-known actors and actresses, this was more than a glimpse into history, it was the eye opening in another part of society that people do not know and may even have ashamed to speak. I've never heard of a book or movie about it before and this is something that black history never tackles, it's just despicable because they were private and mixed, I recommend this movie
