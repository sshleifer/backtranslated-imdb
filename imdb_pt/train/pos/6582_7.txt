Okay, so there's a front view of a Taxi Checker, probably in the late 1930's model. It has the big triangular headlights. There is also a DeSoto taxi in this story of a love gone wrong, in black and white, driven by characters, almost a musical. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is the look of the interiors and fashions of the 1940s rooms and the hotel elevators. The hair styles, male and female are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, she could have been successful. There is an artist loft that would be the envy of all aspiring Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie expecting a great story from Casablanca or the Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. There is a little story under the catwalk model approach in this movie. My copy on DVD with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was cute, but it was not there with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. This was a RKO movie, but it did not have the airplane logo RKO used to use. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature in One Million, B.C., and Sampson and Delilah and especially on Violent Saturday. See if you can find this one. He was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers, called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson did I Led Three Lives on TV in the early 1950s. <br /> <br / Vic Mature was offered the part of Sampson's father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. He was supposedly asked if he would have any problem playing the role of father since he was so known as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I'm going to play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
