A magical journey invented by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS from British cinema mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of the most sweeping early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and twinkling musical Miklos Rozsa, along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all works wonderfully well. Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, the sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect script, which is aptly grandiose. DO NOT MISS THIS! Since posting the above comments, I got the DVD released recently and I can honestly say I had never seen the picture properly until I previewed this DVD version - The clarity and resolution are so accurate and the colors are so vivid that I was stunned - incredible classic can be seen again and never fails to delight and delight the viewer. Again, must see!
