Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of Christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with the books Left Behind, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the evangelistic association Billy Graham, gave us this masterwork . What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can not demonstrate it. The premise of the film is based on pre-millennial, pre-tribulation escatalogy, believing that Christ comes once to the secret take of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What used to terrify me in high school now makes me laugh. Patty's intriguing adventures and her journey during the Tribulation (and two of the three film sequences) tell of her remarkable story of unbelief and, finally, condemnation. I hate to admit it, but I still enjoy watching it. It still has Monty Python's SAME EXACT score and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make that observation.
