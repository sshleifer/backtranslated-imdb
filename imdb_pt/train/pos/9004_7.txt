I had my doubts about another love story in which people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's not at the top of my list yet. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplars, almost stunning, redeem this to be just another tear. Carter's depiction of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even exaggerated at times (sometimes her dialogue dissolves into indistinguishable murmurs). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh can be the perfect complement to your performance. <br /> <br />
