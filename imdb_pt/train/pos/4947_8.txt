We can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman may have time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I did not like." Of course, if you know Peace Vega, what's not to like? Her smile can melt diamonds. She is so fantastic that I can see anything that she is. The same goes for Freeman. it is just magical on the screen. <br /> <br /> The two gave us a movie that was funny from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. He was tender, charming and simply funny. <br /> <br /> You have to check this out.
