I just saw this movie on TV. <br /> <br /> I lost my dad when I was young and this movie certainly touched me. <br /> <br /> I can feel the lost the girl Desi felt ... the feeling of wanting to see her father again ... <br /> <br /> wanting to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> or at least given the chance to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> and I'm so excited about the letter that was written back to her .. <br /> <br /> saying that her father read her letter, and sent it back to someone to answer it and buy her a gift because there is not a store in the sky. <br /> <br /> Just let me feel that there are miracles ..
