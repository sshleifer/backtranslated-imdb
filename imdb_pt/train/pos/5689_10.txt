First, this is a review of the two sets of discs that came along with the rental of the "Wonderland" DVD. <br /> <br /> The two films included in the rent, "Wonderland" and the documentary of Johnny Wadd, completely obliterate myth created by "Boogie Nights". The myth is that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than lugubrious mourners who would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything but detestable selfish prostitutes. This is incredibly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" did with the fable of "The Godfather" and most of the rest of the romantic folklore. <br /> <br /> Now what has annoyed me the most watching these movies, and will probably annoy those who saw and liked "Boogie Nights", is how silly and naive supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no redeeming quality. Holmes was a sociopath criminal who abused anyone close to him, was totally consumed by his pursuit of self-gratification, and was undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal murders at Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film shows the great lie that "Boogie Nights" was, and reinforces Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult movie entertainment industry. This should be required, both features of the "Wonderland" DVD, for anyone who has positive reviews about the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
