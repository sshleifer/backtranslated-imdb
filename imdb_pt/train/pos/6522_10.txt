Throughout the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy Paramount Pictures mania really hit the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed supervised film Cecil B. DeMille and get it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures executives are blind and ignorant of the fact that they have a great pirate movie in their vault over a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, who would have helped make Crescent City a turn. again famous for its pirate connections. When Paramount Executives finally make it to the program and release this movie in digital format, I'll be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures is up to you to get out of your duff and get this restored movie now!
