please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen such a daring and original tale created for the big screen. daring, because the script constantly took a step to so many fantasy films safely avoided - a step towards something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, I've seen it before' or 'I'm sure that's what's going to happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected turnaround and would involve you more and more in the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with talent that fills me with admiration for the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is gorgeous and presents himself with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene he's in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names play prominent roles. I had the stuffing everyone is trying to give their best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply excellent. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a preview today, one day before the official release and hopefully have a huge success. There is lots of humor, but also tense moments and lovely scenes of tenderness. The look in the eyes of Yvaine, the 'frivolities' of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me this is the number one fun movie of 2007, watch and enjoy /> <br /> 11/10 - Outstanding <br /> <br /> peace and love
