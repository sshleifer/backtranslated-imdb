I should give a near perfect rating to How She Move, because the content is really great. As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie is on the 100 list below IMDB! This is absolutely ridiculous! Other movies - particularly those who share the dance theme - are unable to hold a candle in relation to this combination of high-level acting, compelling acting, and incredible dance routines. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the underlying story is finished (it's not just about winning a competition) it's very easy to dig deeper and it's surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters is two-dimensional and, at the end of the movie, it's very easy to feel emotionally involved in them. (And even if you're not the crying type, you might get a little tearful before the credits are released.) <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for dance lovers and even more so for those who can appreciate a poignant and well-represented plot. How she moves is not perfect, of course (what is film?), But it's definitely a cut above the movies that use cute faces to hide a semi-cooked storyline and / or characters that have no substance. The actors and scenarios in this film make a very realistic walk that is equally fascinating thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!
