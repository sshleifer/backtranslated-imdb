I showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I loved it too. The story of termites and their interaction with the environment is incredible. The cast of creatures is deep and everyone plays their parts well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is a truly classic filming. <br /> <br /> Alan Root did an amazing camera job and that should have won the Oscar for Best Documentary. The copy I have does not have Orson Welles narrating (Derek Jacobi) and is not called "Mysterious Castles of Clay", only "Castles of Clay". It makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added to the power of the star and an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS just recently and now it's my children's favorite movie. They brought it to the last family reunion instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you're really lucky.
