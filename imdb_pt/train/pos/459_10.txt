This is the best series of the kind I've seen all year. I can not help but think it's just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the steady stream of cookie-cutter shows ends up with endless episodes. <br /> <br /> I think the New Reasons Successful tricks are many. The scripts are good, and the mix of characters is superb. The acting is top notch, and the mix of comedy and drama works great. The stories are not so memorable, but that's not the reason why I watch shows like this. <br /> <br /> Theme music is a favorite, and we are disappointed to find that it is not available in any published edition. Great thing, BBC - a triumph of sense about sex appeal (besides the young cop, no one is there like lol, and even if he is, he can still act!).
