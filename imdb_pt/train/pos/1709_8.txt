After confusing a Halloween version of Orson Welles' classic WARS OF THE WORLDS radio adaptation for a true Martian invasion, a group of idiot Martians appears on Earth seeking to conquer their plans only when they really see themselves out of their limits. element and in reality all alone. <br /> <br /> This really is often very nice and funny with a few decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It's more likely to appeal to science fiction fans. This passed the test of time for me, as seeing it again recently, proved to be much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast of unnamed stars, this may be the funniest Martian invasion ever made to the movies. Curiously, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost all the classic stereotypes of the Action Hero / Hero of Science Fiction (adolescent 1950s, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and wacky scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare to die! Slag of the Earth!"
