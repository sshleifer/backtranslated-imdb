On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar, they drink a lot together and the next morning, he wakes up with her in bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) may be arriving in his apartment, and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Earlier, he discovers she has crabs and later, in preparation for her wedding dinner, he realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film certainly is the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent actresses and extremely beautiful, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly funny, have good performances. I laughed a lot throughout the story, but there are some scenes that are really hilarious. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds her paints; your imagination in many situations; at the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations on the crab medicine; most of the scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the department store; or when police find a suspect to assault Paul. I could tell a lot of other scenes, but it's better if the reader rents or buys this movie and has a lot of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Crazy For Them"
