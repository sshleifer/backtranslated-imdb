Before joining politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of Britain's best movie actresses. This film exhibits her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of a Royal British captain who has lost the memory of the last 20 years, and Jenny played for American Ann-Margret in a quasi-role unrecognizable as the loving sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from loss of memory triggered by shell shock during World War One. Sir Ian Holm plays a minor role as the doctor treating him. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not help but watch Glenda play a sloppy housewife and the first true love of the Captain, but they came from different classes. It's not the best movie, but it's good to see Glenda's incredible talent. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. She does Margaret Gray in a nice character and you see why a real captain fell in love with her.
