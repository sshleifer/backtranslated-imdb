Carlos Saura's Carmen is one of the best achievements of world cinema, let alone Spanish. It manages to excite the interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations of Bizet with powerful physical force. At the same time, we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of Carmen on the choreographer / director and the leading dancers. The fine line between life and art is breathtaking.
