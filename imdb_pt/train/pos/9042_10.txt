I think I read it somewhere: Joe Johnston (film director and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of their producers or something was breaking his head for a title for the movie, "Rocket Boys" (I think) was missing something. <br /> <br /> One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words of other words (ie: you type a word or series of words and blend the letters and give other words) I think the technical term it's an "anagram" <br /> <br /> Anyway, they typed "Rocket Boys" and sure enough, it's October Sky. They were shocked to say the least. The title summed it all up in the film since the movie revolved around Sputnik. At first, Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he was enthusiastic about it after the "movie poster romance" left and took off.
