Cracking good wire with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Many sexy twists and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his best taste. A precursor to the Thin Man series. Recommend it to everyone. Did you find out everything?
