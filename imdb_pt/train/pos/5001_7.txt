Aardman does it again. Alongside Pixar, Aardman Animation proves again and again how to make animations correctly. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of fun watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought that would translate well for the American public. My only concern is that most audiences will not have the subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> Having been a fan of the BBC version and the short, I knew what I was doing. when I sat down to watch it. The animators did an excellent job combining pre-recorded voices with a perfect matching animal. Look at the first episode with the Goat, which looks flat, and the dogs on the street that continue to be called "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not for a long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see the show last for a full season. But as I said before, the public will not succeed.
