A sweet funny story of two people crossing paths as they prepare for their marriages. The former police writer and public school teacher fall in love with each other in this grandiose New York setting, even though they are marrying other people. Perhaps a bit trivial in that the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the angle of Natasha Henstridge, and the girls - sell them the sappy romance, everyone wins!
