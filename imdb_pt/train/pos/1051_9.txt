This is a powerful documentary on domestic abuse in Cameroon. The "sisters" in the law are lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully sued their husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and conquered a woman from the divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is rather long - about two hours - but fascinating in terms of both individual plaintiffs and defendants as well as lawyers who have successfully represented them in court rooms chaired by female judges. It will leave you, as you left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. How and when did women hold positions of authority in Cameroon? Have the various cases presented in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against the expressed wishes of the husband, a unique event? I am not suggesting that the filmmakers could have answered these questions. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they made deserves a wide audience.
