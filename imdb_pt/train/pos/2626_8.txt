"Lion King 1 1/2" is Disney's funniest non-theatrical release. I recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years. I remember the first time I saw him, I had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by this highly prestigious film. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not exactly bad, it suffered some problems: lack of a good script and bad characterizations, which made the impact of what otherwise would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway: it's cool to see Timon and Pumba's personalities bloom again the way we (or certainly I) love about them in this movie; in "Simba's Pride" they were completely annoying and I also did not like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have been stupid but fortunately the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and instead focused on making this movie at times extremely hilarious. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The score is very good. There are two new songs that are catchy and two new characters, Timon's mother (dubbed by Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, who are nice. The friendship between Timon and Pumba is portrayed touchingly. The emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not seem out of place, which could have been done easily (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there something that distracts this image? votes from me? Yes there is. Although fortunately do not cause much impact, but I will mention them: 1. Many of the scenes from the first movie are used in this. Personally, it was strange to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. During the climax, some jokes become weak. <br /> <br /> 3. In the story, this is Timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his story with that of Simba, the script seems a bit rushed at times. <br /> <br /> But, these details do not affect this fun movie. . It's the only really acceptable sequel to Disney, which must be in every movie collection.
