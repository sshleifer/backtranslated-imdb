Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is the normal guy in high school. Getting ready for the big homecoming game, problems with girlfriend and hair growing in strange places - you know the usual. But the hair in strange places gets a bit out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a perverse case of fur balls. Now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf as Adam will have all the girls? 'Full Moon High' is not often spoken, but it's a silly and fun spoof parody. Larry Cohen (Q, the Winged Serpent, The Things) embodies as many jokes as he can imagine as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a good moment in the lead role. If you're a fan of spoofs like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies', I think you'll have fun with this party.
