After seeing Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction do not seem so extreme. Maybe by current standards of blood and bullets it does not look so bold, but if you think this was in 1972 and the film has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I first started Watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the scene "Dueling Banjos". In that scene, the brutality and edge of this film are truly visible. As I watched Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) go head to head with a seemingly retarted boy really shows how edgy this movie can get. When you think the kid has a little banjo, which he probably could have done by hand, compared to Drew's beautiful and expensive guitar, you really find out how out of your territory the four men are. <br /> <br /> How the plot goes is very believable and never exceeds its limits. But what really distinguishes this film, about four businessmen who earn more than they expected on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all the characters away from simple caricatures or stereotypes. So when the movie goes into complete horror and suspense, I really care about the four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally excellent. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the big cast. Jon Voight is probably the most difficult thing of all in this movie and this is turning his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, the character of Voight is transformed throughout the film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also good in an extremely difficult role, comes to be raped by a backwoods, while Ronny Cox turns into a credible performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that really made this movie powerful to me is that the villains were just as terrifying as any I've ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and extremely scary as the hick. <br /> <br /> The general abandonment was excellent and I suggest it to everyone except for people with weak stomachs and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
