When your DVD was released, I hit the market and bought it. And I think my money was on the right track as I expected before I bought it. Impressive movie what else can I say to Will Smith, He has been an incredible actor as always whether in action movies or serious. It always gives a record braking performance. I think this is the movie after August Rush that makes a person cry while watching. The way the director described the story was truly incredible. His previous life and his new life in the cinema were correctly elaborated for the public. Even I could not find any flaws in the story or the way they filmed it. I think your DVD should be a home because it will really be a cool thing for your collection. It's not the movie that needs fun, it's the movie that allows the audience to learn a lesson. Now, what is the lesson you can see while watching? And I advise people who are movie critics, please note that if you could find some criticism about this movie, then please talk to me.
