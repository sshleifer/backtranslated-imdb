Hrm - I think that phrase was from the old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is an idiotic movie that seems to have been translated from a language that was totally unknown to the translator. Here's a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and the text "In the future ..." will be fun. That means the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that, instead of fighting in wars, nations have giant robots galley and fight to determine, well, this is never very clear, but it is probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists, ie "we") and villains (Commies!) And there are big stop-motion robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effects budget was too small, so we do not see many of the big robots. There are plenty of cheap indoor scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. The space fight is especially enjoyable, since it does not properly serve the other purpose but the blow of the rest of the effects budget. <br /> <br /> With the money spent now, the climactic fight degenerates (and I'm not making it up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. I can always laugh at a bar reenacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> Like I said, it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
