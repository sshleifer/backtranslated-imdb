I came across this movie by accident when I listed all the movies I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on vacation and I'm so glad I included this movie. It deals with issues that most directors avoid, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for TV so I could not buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's a poignant story about how people with eating disorders do not necessarily run away from everyone and how many have diet buddies. I drew attention to the fact that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, they have more serious consequences for health, which many ignore.
