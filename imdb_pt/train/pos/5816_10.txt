The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dance. As I get older, I became more interested in acting as well. While the first half is only a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still fun to watch. The sequence "Badder" could have been left out, although the children were very good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially when the police officer told Michael, "I need your autograph right here," after stopping him for dancing in a non-dance zone. But it's "Smooth Criminal" which is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as the tough guy (and that hair was wild). The dance is perfect and the special effects too. The only thing I could have done without the spiders. Any fan of Michael should see this, if you have not already. I give it a 10+!
