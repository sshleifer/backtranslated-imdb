I myself am a child of heart, which means I love watching cartoons, I still do! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was my favorite still is. I thought man, this was a great "new" show on TV, and from what my dad said, "Bugs, I remember seeing him when I was younger" and I was like, "Dad, Bugs did not exist when you were older young ". So I think he's definitely satisfied more than a generation, possibly 3. I love the show is great for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's really funny, me and my husband, both in their 20s, we love watching the shows, and we do not care about the reruns either. This show brings back many happy memories. I love the Christmas special too with Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can not pick my favorite Looney Toons character because they have changed over the years. When I was little, it was Bugs, of course, and Porky Pig. Pepe's cool, I've always loved him. In fact, I have to say there all my favorites. I'm giving this show a 10 out of 10 because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, dubbing is incredible, the only flaw is that unfortunately came to an end two decades ago but the re-run are great !
