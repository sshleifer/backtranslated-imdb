Of course I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the lead writer for Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for more than 50 years living in Italy. He was a great storyteller and someone suggested that he write his stories. Then Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check your bio, you can see the number of movies that were made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the lead actor who starred in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to check out the locations of "A Girl in Australia" and created a great movie about a substitute bride after World War II. You can see your mood in all of your movies. I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently. GREAT
