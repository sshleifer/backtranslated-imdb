I recorded this a long time ago, but I only saw it today. I was sick so I ran out of things to watch! I am so glad to have seen it, and that I was able to erase my memory and see again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! This reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes at The Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people have said that this is a children's movie. I disagree - it can be done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I loved it! There were times when my spine tingled. The story is unlike any other movie these days, full of adventure. I just ordered the amazon book, I can not wait!
