This show is incredible! I've been a fan since it debuted, and it just keeps me watching ... I've seen some terrible things here that I wish I did not have, BUT, it really shows how addiction affects everyone involved, not just the addict. You can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict, or the foodborne junkie. And, in fact, it's very sad to see some of the famous faces that came along. We have seen talented musicians, an NBA player and even young people who really need the help. And since they started showing some follow-ups, that's been awesome too. Now, you can see how they are for a long time after their episode was aired. If you have not checked this, please do so. It's on A & E, and it's amazing! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10:00 pm EST, if I remember correctly ... then set your TiVo!
