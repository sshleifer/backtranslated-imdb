For me, the question of life and death is just that - simply the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, it conveys the class. It is stimulating, instigating, a mirror for the post-war world and relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply dazzling and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolor to accentuate the different worlds works perfectly. The characters and the development of the plot are almost perfect and attention to detail promotes a totally believable fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I've watched a lot - it never stops touching me. It makes me smile, makes me laugh, makes me think, makes me cry. It's as fresh today as it was in 1946. If I were allowed just one movie to keep and watch again, The Matter of Life and Death would be that movie.
