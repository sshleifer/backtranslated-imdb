Soylent Green IS ... a really good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought of it. I really do not like Heston in his science fiction efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to come across all the contempt and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And, in fact, he mocks a lot of Soylent Green as well, but as he should be playing a super-confident bully, I do not care. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people would turn their noses. in this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visuals (what you know - looks exactly like 1973), and lacking action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was so happy to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving and funny ending role. Small character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is quite relevant today, when no one seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. Funny, is not it, to see Heston in a prototype of the movie Michael Moore ...
