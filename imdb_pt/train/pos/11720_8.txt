I was not expecting much, and to be honest, I did not like this movie the first time, but I watched it again and realized it's cool. Of course, it's a joke movie, but it's a funny joke. <br /> <br /> Somebody posted what could be better written and could be. I think this movie has the potential to be an exaggerated My cousin Vinny. But with a host of horror instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately this is a wasted opportunity. With a little more writing, it can be a classic. Children are underused, there is no reason to cling to Elvira. Beyond the obvious reasons. It would have been great to see their relationship thrive. I know it's a comedy, but it's little differences that separate the good movies from the bright ones. <br /> <br /> Elvira is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Every time she smiles you, too. It's hard to beat a movie when the main character is so charming. And it really is her charm, do not let her seem to fool you into thinking she's a kind of pie. Well, she is. But she's cool. The kind of person you'd let your children take care of. I would not let her cook for them, though ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend giving it a try. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than a great set of boobs. She's also an incredible pair of legs.
