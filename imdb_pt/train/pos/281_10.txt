This game was really great and a great challenge. It has a terrific spooky plot and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all horror fans and it is very exciting from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would have liked more guns, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> A great game for fans of RPG and Shoot'em'up. <br /> <br />
