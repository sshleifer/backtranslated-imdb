I've been meaning to see this movie in the last few months. I was really surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of high school teens who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly intimidate him until one of them makes a horrible mistake that leaves Marty horribly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers is invited back to their own school which is now abandoned for a while. party. However, none of the reckless teenagers organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later in the course of the movie, teenagers begin to die in the most horrible way possible. I can certainly say that they are bloody too. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you discover that it was all a dream and none of this happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not happen, the burns and the jokes apparently happened. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, but okay. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies know what's going on with them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied with the victim's revenge. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that someone choose this if you are looking for slashers from the 80's. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheese slasher!
