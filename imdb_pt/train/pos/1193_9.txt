The memory of "The Last Hunt" stayed with me since I saw it in 1956, when I was 13 years old. It is a film that was way ahead of others when it came to the treatment of the natives, the environment, and the ever-present contrast between the short- and long-term effects of greed. It is as relevant today as it was in 1956, a cinematographic discussion of greater depth and relevance. On top of that, the scenery is beautiful and the cinematography excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me until the end of my days.
