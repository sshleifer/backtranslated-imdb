The visuals and effects are similar to the original movie and provide a lot of entertainment, even if the plot is essentially the same as the first two movies. It also seems much more erotically charged than I remember the other movies being. If you are a big fan of prehensile flying hair and tongues that can reach all the way up to your stomach, you will like this movie.
