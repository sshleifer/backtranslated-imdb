Although the story of a troubled boy turning to boxing by self-respect and control of anger is not new, the story gets a new twist when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. She just can not stay away from fighting. At home, her father is constantly putting her down. Her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up, she decides she wants to train as well. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie "Rocky with girls," I think. But that's nothing like that. The story really benefits a lot from the main character being a girl and not a boy. That way you can handle more problems at once. First, the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a girlie-girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl. It's also a story about how a purpose can change someone's life. How positive things can make you grow. I do not want it to sound pretentious, because the movie does not look pretentious, but what I'm saying is true. <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good at leading. It's a shame she got stuck in the typecasting of the "tough girl" now, because that's not really her part in "Girlfight". Of course she's a boxer, but the most sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> So, maybe this is basically its common story with a twist, but it's well above the Rodriguez crowd. performance. I rate this 7/10.
