Excellent effort by Warner Bros, starring Errol Flynn in one of his best performances on screen. He is often quoted as his best, and I can not really fully judge until I have seen his "Dawn Patrol". However, their work on "They died with their boots on" takes a little beating. I'm a big fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps him be an Australian) and I think he's just wonderful, a great onscreen presence and a great actor too. He is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as the legendary boxer with the extravagant footwork, but he is also backed by a warm, funny, literate script and directing by Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've ever seen loses a beat of his rhythm, he really was a born filmmaker. Walsh directs the scenes of the ring beautifully, as he does with the lighter moments and that great final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to that great production values ​​(the "Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And a lovely supporting cast and practically perfect entertainment. Alan Hale used to be Flynn's helper, but here's your father, and yet it works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. They're both in love with each other.
