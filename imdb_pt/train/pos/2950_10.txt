If you were sad about not getting a DVD movie, it was probably 'Delirious' you were looking for. How often do you laugh while watching the comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his prime time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not so funny) I never knew where Eddie had a great deal of his inspiration. Now that I'm older, and I've seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I realize two things: Everybody STOLE from Eddie, while Eddie LOVINGLY ASKED from Richard. That's the big difference: was Eddie original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. He was something never seen before. He was all we needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but once he was the king, and "delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
