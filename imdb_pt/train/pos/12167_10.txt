What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that it stops working? How alone can a man stay? When the mundane crap we have to do to be part of society is too much, what happens? Frownland explores these issues. Definitely an amazing original debut by Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic when we enter the mind of a guy named Keith who is so confused that he can barely make a proper sentence. We follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day by day. Most of us know people like that - people who say "sorry" too much or "I appreciate" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people out there like that, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because it's interesting and Bronstein and the lead actor, Dore Mann, do a great job. This movie is as un-commercial as a movie can get. Some friends filmed over a few years while saving money. It was shot at 16mm and the scratch film look has a low budget. Without a distributor, this can be hard to find, I think it's been running randomly for a year or two. I hope it's on DVD at some point. I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in Los Angeles. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that says anything about how weird this movie is. Highly recommended.
