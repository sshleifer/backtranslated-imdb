This was a must-see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004 so I definitely would watch the replay. I really sympathized with the main character in the film because, that's true, I have a milder skin condition than he had, Epidermolysis Bullosa Distrophic (EB). This is a sad, sometimes entertaining and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disease. Jonny Kennedy talks like a kid (because of vocal muscle wear) and never went through puberty, but he's 36 years old. Most moments of sympathy are seeing his awful condition and eliminating his bonds. Jonny had a rather mischievous sense of humor, he even narrated beyond the grave by showing his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. He won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director (Factual), and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and for the Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 in The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. A must see documentary!
