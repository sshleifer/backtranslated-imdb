A classic series that must be at least repeated or released on DVD.Billy Toth, after realizing that he is adopted after the death of his parents, embarks on a journey to find his real parents. After several rites of passage, your search culminates. I discovered that your father's identity was stolen and used by a trafficker of people in Europe! As I recall, the series ends on the Austrian ski slopes and a chase at the top of the cliff resulting in the death of Billy's traitor. filmed in various locations across Europe and appeared polished and incredibly well done with a few episodes that intersect the realms of the film noir and crime thriller. The main arch was often eclipsed by the slices of life that Billy spent during his years of toil to find the secrets of his mother and father. An act of class, but underestimated and forgotten.
