I watched this movie in the early hours of the morning when I should be asleep. This, in itself, was a testament to the fact that Deliverance was a binding film. I think Boorman did a wonderful job directing this movie. How skillfully the initial scene with the people of the hills and the banjos of mourning was made. It showed up as well and early as the inherently reserved and simple people of the area were. Case in point - near the end of the "duel", the boy who played the banjo was smiling (he loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the boy was too reserved to respond. The river trip never left you bored, for sure. The rape scene was brutal but needed to show exactly what the group was up against in that region of Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterwards was well done. Some said he was not affected by the ordeal. I disagree - if you really paid attention, he did not respond throughout the action immediately after, in which Reynolds put the arrow through the striker and they chased the toothless guy. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, on top of the cliff. It almost looked like the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and waiting to die, but then you realized that the arrow he had thrown before had finally come into effect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie, and I was wavering between a 8 and a 9 in my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave him a "1", I gave him a "10". The reasoning of this individual seemed to be based on personal prejudice rather than an objective point of view, and his vote was obviously an uncorrelated attempt to reduce classification.
