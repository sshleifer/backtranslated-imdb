This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a girls' movie and a little how I ended up with this. I had never heard of him or anyone else in him (Mike exits from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give incredible performances. Humor is consistently dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd practically plays the character Mike from Friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is stereotyped (I mean, we're not talking about Apocalypse Now here). But the characters are nice, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, production and direction work well. <br /> <br /> In all a great movie feel good that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I do not really understand the critiques of a star for this.
