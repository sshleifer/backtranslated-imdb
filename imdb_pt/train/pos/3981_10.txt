This is my fourth short Joe McDoakes I've seen and so far the funniest. In this, Joe takes voice lessons from a record representing Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, by the way), he asks Jack Carson the directions that are confusing. He then meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks in his most normal voice, who is not too far from his future Geroge Jetson and arrives at the set where he automatically disturbs the director. I'm going to stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and I was fascinated by the appearances of the movie stars at the end. The final scene was especially a scream, so go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be on Picutres!
