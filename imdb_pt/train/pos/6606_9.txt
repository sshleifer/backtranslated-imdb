Hollywood time to sit and watch! If the actors are acting like snobs, all you have to do is get the animators who worked on that little wonder. Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget you're not seeing humans. Although the voice of the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) is one of the best I've heard, yet the emotions portrayed by the 'cartoons' are unnerving. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadows makes the film a living painting. Ironically, this technical magic makes you forget that this is really a very good movie. The plot's progress and development are wonderful and the dialogues are clear. Synopsis: The disappearance of the main employee of a mega-company uncovers a tale of fraud and corruption with a cold-hearted hero at the helm. I can not say too much without giving it all ... except that while the film keeps you at the end of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> One must watch ... even for the 'adults who smile at' cartoons'
