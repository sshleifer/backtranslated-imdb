This film gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We as a people of African descent owe it to ourselves to make a change in this cycle of "all talk and no action" and begin to realize in order to make a change, there must be fewer conversations and more action. It is a powerful statement of our people's divisions on small issues, and our failures to recognize the larger picture and the need to come together to make a difference ... Despite its reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message that this film seeks to portray.
