The MATADOR is a hit movie ... if you can say that about a hit movie. Violence is never really shown, but often introduced. At first I was afraid that I was in another mid-'90s reattachment of gang-man-gang-hipster-dark-obscure, but I was happily surprised when I realized that this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. Nothing very exciting happens in this movie, but every part of it makes me smile. The three leaders have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a lot of fun making this movie together. The writing is clear, although it sometimes seems that the script had been adapted from a play because of the dialogue scenes. This is a good movie that I probably will not remember for long, but at the time it was a complete joy. Good movie.
