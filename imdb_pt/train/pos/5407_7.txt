I've always liked the Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very tacky, mediocre in some areas and sure, even if they are meant for small children, they are too adult in some fields to be able to protect them with the statement "Hey, lighten up, it's a children's movie ", but all that aside, they are still not good bits of entertainment? In my opinion, they are like that and I really like them. This is as fun as the previous three, and certainly more beautiful. It has some really sweet and exciting moments as it is the introduction of the lovely and cool Celebi Pok√©mon. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I like it more than the third installment, even if the third is not bad, and the whole series is just fun, harmless, fun in the popcorn family and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. This movie has some high notes of intensity and interest, especially around the climax / end, as well as all the installments, and the characters, while a bit more lackluster than the previous three, I thought, are still friendly and funny. This movie is the lowest and most criticized of the four feature length adaptations, and does not deserve this.
