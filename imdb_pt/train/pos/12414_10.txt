Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best in a series of prison horror films (such as "House of Death" or "The Chair") in the late 1980s. Twenty years earlier, guard Lane Lane had executed a wrongfully convicted. Now he is the prison's recently reopened prison director, and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very melancholic film presents a lot of violence and horrible violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are up front for the fun carnage.
