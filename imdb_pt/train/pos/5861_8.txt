Overall, I fully agree with Ebert's review. In a way, I feel I should not be commenting since it's a very veterinary film and I'm not a veterinarian (I was a tough one). The flaw is that Martha is underdeveloped and does not act consistently. My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian and spent very little time planning his character.
