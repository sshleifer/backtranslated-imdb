Girlfight is a story about a troubled teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is overwhelmed by her mother's suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community. A short temper and many things to light a fire, she is about to be expelled from school for fighting. His brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), is training with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Diana is informed by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to deliver this weeks pay for Tiny's training. While Diana is walking through the gym, she realizes that's what she wants to do. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to train, but he refuses because she is a girl and should do more "feminine" things. All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy. She is not despised because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, pure 'effing' genius. I recommend it to anyone who needs to see a good clean movie without 'monkey business'.
