After some of the negative reviews I heard about this movie, I was hesitant to give it a go but I had Â£ 3.99 in my wallet and thought Id gamble on buying a budget like the movie and saw this and gave it back and I'm glad I did, I liked it. Directed by the movie star like Chain Reaction, The Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox) I had to play with it, even though it was rubbish, but it was nothing, I found some of the humor quite funny especially Alfred Molina, the star of Spider-Man 2, the character Doc Ock. It was excellent the most enjoyable part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name, and that made me understand! and not his part is not great, it's too short at the end of the movie, it's not a big part that makes me believe that's why people hate the movie. I suggest you take a chance. Some parts are a poor well that needed polishing, acting and a little more action. But it's watchable.
