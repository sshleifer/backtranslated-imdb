Very well done and scary horror movie from PRC, which usually makes really extravagant movies like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. The German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his set of marshes tied to the studio. Gaunt and macabre Charles Middleton is effective as the Strangler.
