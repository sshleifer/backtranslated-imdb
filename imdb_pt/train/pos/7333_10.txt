This is a great movie. probably the best movie I've ever seen. I watch it over and over again. I should give 10/10 stars because, like I said, this is probably the best movie I have ever seen. This movie + popcorn + cocaine = best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch some movie, then I clearly recommend this. First I saw that I liked it, so I bought it and now I own it and probably watch it every day. my kids like it and think this is the best movie ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I do not want to ruin the whole movie so you can enjoy it after reading my text. Lovely Movie Lovely Characters, Lovely Story, And Just Great Things. a must watch movie. I hope you enjoyed my comment Cya <br /> <br /> Jim Make
