This is NOT a movie as bad as some critics, and like the summary on the IMDB page for this movie, say it is. Because? The first is the fact that in 1984 filmmakers were bold enough to confront the issue of domestic violence as one of the plot elements - so critics who complain about the plot are sadly missing out on one of the main points! Second, without the plot element of Prince's relationship with his abusive father, the musical climax would not work as well as he did - so those critics who say that only good music are missing once again one of the points. - specifically, BECAUSE it's so good ... because all the music in this movie has a plot element background that makes music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For producers and filmmakers for the first time, this is not so bad! There are much worse movies for talented movie people! And finally, critics who say the music is "good" have also lost their point - see Prince's variety of stylistic treatments, variety, musicality, and stage performance - truly unique, going musically where no one else was going during the 1980s, and with a style seen in the work of other artists (clothes and moves: what elements of extras came first, Michael Jackson or Prince's? Also, see if you can see the scattered fingers sweeping in front of the eyes which Prince does in this film, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction." As the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all.
