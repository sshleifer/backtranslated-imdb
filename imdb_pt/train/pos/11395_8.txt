I took some old musicals out of my garage and this is another of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. Won two Oscars for Best Film of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris trying to succeed. Nina Foch is a sophisticated media lady and is very interested in helping you, but soon discovers that she loves the guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls in love with a lovely maiden, Leslie Caron. Your main dance partner, and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. The famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So if you like good smooth dancing and fun scenes filled with Oscar Levant's agile piano fingers, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful jewel. 8/10
