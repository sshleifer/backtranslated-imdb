I thought this movie was great because Corrine and Sean were newcomers. It was full of action and a bit of romance, but there were some points where Corrine did not speak very clearly (when she threatened Sean with the gun) and she gritted her teeth ... maybe she should? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were portrayed very well, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I watched the next action star, I'm sure that Corrine and Sean made their own stunts, which were performed very well. I'm looking forward to another couple's movie, how they make a great team, or maybe a sequel to betting their lives - possibly called 'big making' in the big apple. ', this time it could be about Carmen ... I bet your life is EXCELLENT!
