The Sentinel features a sort of mill rush and clich√© suspense / mystery, but is raised with a good performance and a good pace. These stories have gone through most of the permutations we can endure, so what we have left is how good the acting is, how clever are the configurations and villains, how well worked the main plot is, and so on. ..... then Sentinel does a solid job, given its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland maintain some good bravado and attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on screen) brings a satisfying support. The whole side of the story case is totally implausible to knock it over a bit, but it deserves slack. Worth seeing if you like the genre.
