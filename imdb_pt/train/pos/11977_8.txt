IT'S OK. Who brought the cheese? I love it. During the execution, it became a phenomenon. The anorexic twins became popular.Bob Saget began to make a salary (instead of his REALLY funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. He was humorous and always brought home a good lesson. And this is where I differ from the norm: I liked the last seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children grow up, there is a lot more that you can do with the script. That's why I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it did. But anyway. I gave an 8/10 because of his funny and funny stories, and because of Bob Saget!
