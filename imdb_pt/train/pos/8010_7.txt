I previously thought that this movie was the worst of the Muppets' films. I would now like to portray this statement. In my opinion, now, MUppet's most ridiculous movie was the TV movie. IT'S A VERY HAPPY MUPPET OF CHRISTMAS, BUT IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE THAT WAS TRULY HORRIBLE. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than the MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the song 'You can not take no for an answer', the one that the Muppet Babies sing and the songs for the grand finale itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequel here (I was told that was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) <br /> <br /> The MANHATTAN MELODIES show was the true showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line "What better way could end something?". But I wish the thing between the beginning and the end was a little more fun. There are beautiful appearances by Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence by Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late and great Jim Henson) and the film certainly entertains. I must declare that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definitive MUppet films.
