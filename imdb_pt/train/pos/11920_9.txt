Christopher Lloyd is funny and really believable as "Al the head angel". This movie is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the former did not have, as well as a much better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> OK - it was written for kids, but adults have as much fun as kids do. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is not a cab meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as show some real acting talent for a change, a nice change. <br /> <br /> Watch it at least once - it's worth the effort to catch it.
