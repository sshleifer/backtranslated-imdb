Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just received a girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God in their church, with their two older children watching. Michael takes a vacation and the family decides to go to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive sights in all of Australia. Not being rich, the family camp near the place. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the stalls. Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy runs to the tent, a dingo dog is coming out, shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the whole camp looks for the baby, it is not found. Concluding that she is dead and that the dingo has fled with her beloved son, the Chamberlain struggle to accept God's decision and continue with their lives. But unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the media and soon circulates the story that Lindy murdered the baby. She is later arrested and brought to trial. How could this happen? This is a great representation of real events that shows how the "crowd rule" is not an invention of the imagination. The whole country turns against the Chamberlains, partly because they are seen as strangers. Streep gives her the best performance ever as the Lindy complex, whose own will-power behavior works against her every step of the way. Neill, in the same way, does a wonderful job as Michael hesitant and confused. The cast is one of the greatest of all time, with representations of people across the country taking an interest in Lindy's case. The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line. If you have never seen or heard of this movie, correct it immediately. It is not far from the truth to say that this "Choro" must be seen by all who care about the cinema and the misused power of the media.
