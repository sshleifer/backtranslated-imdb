SERIES 1 <br /> <br /> As the UK eagerly awaits the release of the 'Lost' series two, series one (which has just been shown here) did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> A group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crashed on a deserted island. They pray for ransom. However, as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the forest that surrounds them, they begin to wonder if they are alone. <br /> <br /> Of course, the series has a hard time keeping pace after the explosive. pilot episodes, that throw in the group a polar bear, a giant animal and the possibility of others in the island. However, the series manages to recover after some episodes and is notable for the final episode. Possibly the best thing about 'Lost' is the fact that we visited the life of each character before the accident in a series of flashbacks. This gives us more insight and therefore more suspense and excitement as events unfold in the present. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this show is an excellent combination of drama, suspense and supernatural; is, simply, a must-see. SPOILERS FOR THE SEASON 1 FOLLOW <br /> <br /> SERIES 2 <br /> <br /> After the cliffhanger which was the end of the Series 1 of 'Lost', the series 2 begins with our protagonists plunging deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the hatch. They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do. Meanwhile, Michael and Sawyer struggle to deal with the aftermath of what happened on the raft. As the series progresses, viewers will not be able to turn off the television set, as each episode the series contains more twists than a Curly-Wurly bar, one of which features a number of new characters. With each mystery solved with 'Lost', five new ones seem to come out of the wood. After the series 974th plot, it finally reaches the viewer that it does not matter if the survivors of the plane crash leave the island. However, the impressive end of the series answers slightly more than half of these issues, despite its anti-climactic end.
