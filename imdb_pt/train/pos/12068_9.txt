If you have some kind of appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, you will find plenty of absorbent material in this film. It was probably originally a play, and that's why the dialogue is heavy, but I can not emphasize enough about how these icons that we only understand superficially are transformed into truly complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> Film is better than any college course to tell you how to create a story based on characters. <br /> <br />
