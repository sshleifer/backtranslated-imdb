Obviously, there was not a huge budget for this movie that definitely stopped production. But the story and the ending were so brutal that they made up for it. I mean brutal at the level of Ju Dou and other (large) Chinese films. I saw this for the first time when I was 14, I rushed home and begged God to forgive me for everything ...
