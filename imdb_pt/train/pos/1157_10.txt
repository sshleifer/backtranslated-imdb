This is one of the best comedies of all time! The writing of this soap parody is brilliant and the cast, well, just look at the names of the cast and you will understand why it is so great. If you're a fan of Kevin Kline, he does (as always) a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
