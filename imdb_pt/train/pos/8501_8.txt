I think it's a great example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a great movie to show in a sociology class. I thought it was very funny and I must say that I am a sucker for that "leaves band together and do the job" plotting device. It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It has some dramatic elements and I think they blend in very well. Overall, I give a solid 8.
