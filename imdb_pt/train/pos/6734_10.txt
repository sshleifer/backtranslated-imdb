The Riding Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the story and stories of three influential big-wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an incredible job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated on having done such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is brilliantly edited and works perfectly with narration, interviews, animation and surfing pictures. The music soundtrack only increases the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making the Riding Giants a brilliant sight. Personal highlights include any of Greg Noll's comments, with his forthright directness, Laird Hamilton's filming on Teahupoo and the shots taken at the end of the film. But in fact, this whole movie is a big highlight and recommended it is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. It is a pity that it is no longer known, but it is a jewel that deserves attention. 10/10
