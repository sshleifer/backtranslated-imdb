Like the Jeffersons, Good Times was one of the classic American serials that never aired in the UK, not to mention it came out in the 1970s, a decade when I was not born yet. <br /> <br /> But like most of the program's fans, I watched a few episodes on You Tube - and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is led by James and Florida - two parents trying to get acquainted and, despite the lack of qualifications, encourage children, who have their own aspirations in life, to stick to them and take risks. James was the strict but loving father, who dared not discipline J.J, Michael, and Thelma-if they went beyond the limit. While Florida, in contrast, was a fair, kind, caring mother and a loving wife, though she was in many ways James-like, with respect to her attitudes toward fatherhood and family values ​​from an Afro- American. <br /> <br /> Children were as lively and fun as their parents: JJ was an aspiring artist with a silly personality and a crazy sense of humor, who used to wear multicolored clothes and whose 'DY-NO-MITE' slogan is as contagious and familiar as the "Whatchoo talking" about Arnold Jackson's Willis? of Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was the clever one, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while Sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. His verbal insults with JJ were largely hilarious, as was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was very well played by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Throughout the seasons, there have been a few appearances made, most notably Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as himself! I really prefer Good Times just said, The Cosby Show, which was a show from the 80's because: a) I preferred the Evans family on the Huxtables, both in terms of a) characterization and b) how I felt it dealt with social issues serious and difficult, in a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary aimed at highlighting the lives of working class African Americans in the 1970s. The Cosby Show attempted to serve the mainstream public in a "sweet" way, as the Huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily incorporated into a high-class American culture to which we associate whites, while the Good Times, in contrast, was much more edgier and was not afraid to approach issues such as drugs and child abuse in a realistic way . I really thought that while The Cosby Show might be fun to watch at times, it lacked a bit of 'bad luck' that Good Times has and made it more stylish and cool. <br /> <br /> The show did skip the shark over the last few seasons, as it continued after the character of John Amos, James died in a strange accident (actually it was known at the time that John left Good Times forever. so the death of his character was written as it is on the show). Without John, the show suffered and, unfortunately, lost much of its charm. <br /> <br /> Still, for a sitcom, Good Times scored all the right boxes. If they had shown this in the UK during the 80's. As it certainly is, as JJ would put it, 'DY-NO-MITE !!' My rating: 8 and a half
