I know a lot of people have a special affection for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens's story, but for me, that 1984 version is the one you should win. My wife and I own a copy of this movie on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often notice that we could watch on Halloween too because it is a very frightening ghost story. Scott-typecast as Scrooge-is tremendously evil and unpleasant, making his transformation even more miraculous and moving. I think it's there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each one more frightening than the last. Watching the dark, floating form of the coming Christmas Spirit causes shivers down your spine every year. And what a support cast! David Warner in particular is in top form as Bob Cratchit as well as Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to remember that this version is closer to the original story than most of the others - but I may be mistaken, as it has been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a fantastic Christmas classic.
