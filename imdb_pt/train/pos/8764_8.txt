Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been best friends ever since, and after graduating they decide to take a trip to Thailand. Due to an incident, they meet a mysterious and attractive young man who invites them to go with him Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are mistaken for heroin drug smuggling and are sent to jail. Now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. This was a very good movie, I've seen it a couple of times and after a while you realize that they are some holes in the plot, but the movie still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes did a great job as always, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
