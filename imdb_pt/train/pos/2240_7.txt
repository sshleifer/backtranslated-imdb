My permanent love for Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped boost my puberty with her 1965 performance in "Thunderball", led me to some rather unusual places. Case in point, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne's F.O.", which features Lucianna in one of her previous roles. She plays a princess in this, although the image is actually a showcase of the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, whose stars were certainly on the rise at this time. In this cute, often very funny movie, we learned about the island-island Gaillardia, which until then was a British colony until 1916 and then was universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of world attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there, and His Majesty orders Carlton-Browne, the fumbling, Foreign Ministry to take over. Terry-Thomas very well underestimates this part, as well as Sellers in his role of small-country prime minister. (This was the second 1959 Sellers movie about a tiny country that blends with the world, the other is "The Mouse That Resounded," of course). Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as the gentle king of Gaillardia, and my girl Lucianna is as attractive as possible in her minor role. The film takes the dry mood very seriously, though there are a few laughter (the reception at Gaillard airport, for example, and especially that Gaillardian May Day-style parade). And Sellers's decadent Prime Minister, with his English stains and seemingly perpetual sweat, is another memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the occasional case or two of the indecipherable, rigid, high-lipped British jargons, I found this image a victoriously modest entertainment, and well presented on this Anchor Bay DVD.
