Another Downey must see! If you are a fan obsessed like me, you have to see this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate who realizes that the life in which he has just entered is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a wise and happy lawyer married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on his one-year birthday when he gets hit by a car. He demands to return, only this time on the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., too much confusion and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this film is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is something like reincarnation. . And if so, how often do you find the same souls life after lifetime. I do not know the answer. But I know you need to see this movie. It's a riot and Downey looks SO GOOD in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love and true love never dies. It is only recycled.
