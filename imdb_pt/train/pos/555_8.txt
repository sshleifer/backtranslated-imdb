My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the United States in February 1955. I saw it at a "first run" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. Would you like to know if it was reissued or something wrong? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a good job as a corrupt judge / businessman / thief. Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives as good a performance as he already did. I've seen this movie half a dozen times or more, and I never tire of seeing parts of it again. The photograph and landscape are splendid and offer a remarkable amount of entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
