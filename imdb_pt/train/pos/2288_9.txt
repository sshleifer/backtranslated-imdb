It is so rare to find a literary work properly translated onto the screen that I may have rated this movie higher than it deserves, but not much. As a longtime student of Vonnegut's works, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to its readers, at least for those who love it as I do. The cast is inspired: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, perplexed in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is exuberant everywhere, but her way of dealing with the treacherous Resi and her tragic boom almost makes you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin offers a totally amiable but equally treacherous Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Do not think you have to read Mother Night to enjoy the movie; however, if you have not yet read Mother's Night, you'll probably want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the color changes to black and white and vice versa. Final symbolism of the Campbell Tie. See also the appearance of Kurt Vonnegut near the end of the film. Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I write in mid-December when the song is getting heavy and it's driving me crazy).
