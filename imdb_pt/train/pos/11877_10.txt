Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a film that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the "king" in the world of drugs while ruthlessly manages his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film has about 180 F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is fun and you will never get bored. You cheer for the drug master, and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as bad as some other Crime Lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you to see it. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
