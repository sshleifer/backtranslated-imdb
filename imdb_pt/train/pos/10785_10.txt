I saw this when I was small and excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices were cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle, where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius Snoodle and Doodle eat very sweet. What is sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that skips the Meices of Meecy in the head, then by a fairy will give some wishes Little Bunny Foo Foo, so he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoody, Doodle goes to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great kids will enjoy this show, new words, songs and watch them playing.
