Maybe I loved this movie partly because I feel depressed and it's a cute fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, clever story, beautiful effects, great acting (especially De Niro, which is incredible). This movie made me happier than I have been for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and clever film. The joke in the story of the prince's savagery and the consequences, the way he indulged in the magical effects of the witch and dozens of little smart touches kept me fascinated. That's a lot of what makes it so good; is an elaborate film, loaded with special effects, with more story than most fairytale films, but there is an incredible attention to small things. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm just going ahead and watching it all over again.
