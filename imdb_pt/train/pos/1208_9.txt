Every kid has that movie that he shows up on VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there's a nanny nearby. This was the movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times, at least, and I can say it's a good children / family movie. <BR> I still have the tape, I did not watch it in 5 years, but maybe I'm going to take a walk this week, and be a child of the day. <br /> <br /> You just have to love the nursing bears and your messege. <br /> <br />
