This movie was a classic. I would have to say that this movie got the best of a man who learns from his mistakes. if we could get along and learn how everyone in this movie did. He had an important part to show how family is an important part of life, and how pride can make you miss something important in life if you can not find a "GREAT THROAT" and swallow your pride.
