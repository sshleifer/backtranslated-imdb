As a child I remember being nine or ten years old and loving this movie. It was the Bollywood action / comedy movie. It's an imitation of Bad Boys, of course! All the exchange identity, but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out the window and then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing! The action scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still amazing scenes. The film is genuinely very funny and it was the great return that Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a gem as always and this is probably his best work to date, it shines as the side kick and offers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs ... The songs are both funny and catchy .............. proving laughter when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh like 'Bade Miah' .... your accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song. ............. Hilarious.
