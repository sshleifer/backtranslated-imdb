The Straight Story is a multilevel exploitation of America's goodness and beauty. On one level, a slow walk through the heart, are gentle denizens and grains of amber, on another level of aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Lynch gives us time in this film and helps me to remember that much can be said in silence. A remarkable film that will rest gently with me for some time.
