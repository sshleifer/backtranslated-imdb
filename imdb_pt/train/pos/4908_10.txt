I saw Martin's Day for the first time when I was only 10 years old at home on The Movie Channel, and I still remember the impact it has had on my life. It touched me like no other movie touched me, and I remember rolling my eyes out. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw him, I could not find him anywhere else. I'd ask around and no one had ever heard of the movie! I think it was one of those rarer movies that many people did not know because nobody, and I mean nobody, knew what I was talking about. I searched and searched over the years, checking video store shelves and scanning cable TV listings, but it always fell short. Finally, in 1996, I discovered that I could order it in particular, and I've probably watched it at least 50 times since then - and it still makes me cry, every time. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but genuinely a good guy), who yearns to return to the special lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place where he lived from nature, spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film, he escapes and begins to make the way back to the lake. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the police to find him, and Steckert catches a child as a hostage to persuade the police to go back outside. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (the second Martin) become best friends, and they have lots of fun adventures together - from stealing a toy truck to a train, all the way to that special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Steckert has his big flashbacks in the lake as a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the finalization for you, but I'll tell you, this movie is a must see. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am undoubtedly the biggest fan of this movie EVER! I was able to find the song that the two Martin are singing during the movie ("I'm coming back, from where I come ...). I'm even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cabin where Martin is. The day was filmed , I know, but this movie means a lot to me.
