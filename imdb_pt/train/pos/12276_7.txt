Can an environmental production like that have failed in its main objective, which was to correctly adapt Allende's romance? Obviously yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial and superficial film in which basic elements of the South American mentality are presented simply as parallel events, resulting in total incoherence. I can not believe there was a whole production team that did not understand the book! There is, of course, technical quality in this film and I think the actors did the best they could with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. And that something was the most important part.
