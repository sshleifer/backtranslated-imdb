I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with Rodgers and Hart, but could not solve the copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote among them, most of the songs for Bing Crosby contributed a great score. <BR> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this movie, "fit Crosby like a glove" and I could not have put it better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie, and in 1949, Crosby was Hollywood's most lucrative star. For once Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never more adorable on the screen. This was a woman for whom technicolor was invented. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's origins in Brooklyn stand out, but it's for a good comic effect. The trio of Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a good time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his optimistic philosophical figures patented with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. <br /> <br /> The third song he sings Once and For Always alone and with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for best song but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Pleasing also that Bing was able to record the Decca soundtrack with Rhonda Fleming, Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comedic talents without Bob Hope. I like the Road photos, but Bing was a comedic talent for himself and this movie is better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
