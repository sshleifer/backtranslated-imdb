Antonioni really did show some "cojones" when he made this film. He went to America working under contract for the most luxurious studio (MGM) and made the most compelling portrait of American society I've ever seen. Having seen LA firsthand, this is the most accurate picture of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial by the studio is understandable, after such a huge investment and a discouraging return. It's sad that people do not see this movie anymore, because I believe that Antonioni has proved correct. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space in the inhospitable (but beautiful) desert and beyond. How I would like to see the interest in this re-lit movie and a lavish DVD release. <br /> <br /> I beg people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a genuinely unique movie commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we forget that. <br /> <br /> An unexpected jewel.
