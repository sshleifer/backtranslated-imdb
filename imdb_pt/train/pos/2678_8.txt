Hey, now, I can not claim to have seen all the movies of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and sure enough there seems to be a lot of them, but that's one of the best (and strangest) of what I've seen. I'd say he was probably on his best lap in the late sixties / early seventies and anything lately has been a little strange to me, and it takes a lot for me to declare it. Anyway, this is like a big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points. This woman is an actress or something, she performs at some theater in Berlin where acts of "false" torture are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) And she seems to have this problem with the dream. The footprint for what is real and what is not in this movie is apparently that the real thing is in focus and the things of dreams are not. It seems to exist in a state of déjà vu. I will not say it makes much sense, but it's really wild and weird and fun. Berlin shots make it look like a lonely and scary place, which adds to the atmosphere. The ending is extremely abrupt, the film ends and the tape turns black, I think there is no need for you to know that it ended at that moment. My copy was from the Euro-Trash Collection, Anchor Bay, and I mean, give me more Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of this crap. But it sucks.
