Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. She is perfect. His inexperience in acting really works in his favor. We've never seen her before, so it sounds like her story. It also brings genuine resistance. This works against it, because we never doubt it. You never have to cheer her for winning because she never faces any fighters that we do not think she can beat. So, like a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> So again, this is not really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You do not But Karyn Kusama has it anyway. Like many indie films, "Girlfight" defies ranking or genre and stands out as folklore that can happen almost in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is doing poorly at school. She hits people she does not like (all the other girls at school, for example). It does not fit. His father is forcing his younger brother Tiny to learn boxing so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives little money to his boxing sessions and gives nothing to Diana, as if she did not need to defend herself, or anything worth doing in her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (clich√©, yuck), so he gives up his boxing permit for Diana, who really wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls in love with another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is looking to become a pro. From there, the story comes to the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title fight. <br /> <br /> What made me cold was that I never found any of it interesting. It's all a little too believable. Children with difficult lives growing up in difficult urban areas resort to sports. Many professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness that this education requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big Deal. <br /> <br /> Or there's another stance to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Female boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality we often see in boxing movies is replaced here by discussions about people's lives and feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of a great job for a first time director. The dialogue never surpasses the quality of the novel, but the story itself has really changed my mind about some things. Yes, the world now seems a better place. A movie did that. <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
