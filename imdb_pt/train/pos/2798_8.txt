Jess is 18, very clever and wants nothing more than playing football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents over and over again, as they would never approve of her pursuing her dream, they want her to be establish a good Indian boy and learn how to cook. <br /> <br /> Double as Beckham is a very funny movie that does not need to be deep and complex, okay. The cast is very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A great movie for the Family 8/10
