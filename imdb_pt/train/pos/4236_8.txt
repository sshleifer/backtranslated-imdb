Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the movie is incredible, but I like everything that Burton did. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the b / c world of that movie. It should not be a remake, and it's not. <br /> <br /> The ending was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
