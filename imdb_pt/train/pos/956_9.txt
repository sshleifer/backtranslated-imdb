The simple handheld gives some almost documentary feeling to this film, and also relates to the dogma films. <br /> <br /> Have you ever had enough of those Hollywood-style cop movies with tough guys who get chores? would be envious of? Fed up with the single, married divorcee, the divorced but the family man, the donut personified and the hardened hunter? Ever wondered what real police work is like? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. Situated in the north between western Germany and eastern Germany, the ex-DDR, a fired postal worker, begins her work, newly arrived at the police school. She quickly finds her way around the usual patrons, and gets used to life as a cop ... but that's not much fun. Other German crime films like Derrick, Der Alte et cetera have dignified officers talking quietly to suspects. These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. Good dialogue and realism make this an interesting sight, especially if you know part of Germany a bit.
