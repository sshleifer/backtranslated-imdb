Director Edward Montagne makes in just over an hour what other more expensive and sensational films can not do. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. who, while not one of the best of the genre, keeps the viewer involved in everything that is happening. <br /> <br /> Clearly a type B movie. In fact, the best thing for "The Tattooed Stranger" is the opportunity to take a look at the way New York seemed in those years. The crystal-clear cinematography of William O. Steiner, or has been maintained so over the years, or has been carefully restored. <br /> <br /> There are great views of New York in the opening sequence. We were later taken to Brooklyn for the Dumbo section and later the film traveled to the Bronx region and Gun Hill Road with its many monumental shops in the area. <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great presentation. detective team Patricia Barry is perfect as a plant specialist at the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord, who went to bigger things in his career, is seen in a role that does not speak. It was so much fun to see a city, as it was, because it no longer exists.
