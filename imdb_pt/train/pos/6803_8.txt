In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as Queen Victoria of Britain, when she is suddenly placed on the throne at age 18, learns to rule despite the machinations of politicians and ends up dating and marries Prince Albert of Saxony . . Kitschy and Campy (although surprisingly true to the actual events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Watching this film about British royalty spoken in German enhances its unique charm. On that front, one wonders why an Austrian film was made about an English queen; but then he remembers that in 1954, Austria was still under occupation by Allied troops, including the British. Maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
