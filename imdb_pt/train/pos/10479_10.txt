This is the movie that was really recommended to me by my dentist, and I'm glad he did! The mix of British humor (shall I say, Humor?) And the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a joke. Add to that mix the reality of what's needed to actually grow marijuana (those plants under the bushes would NOT do that without the TLC they got), and it's a truly hilarious and touching movie. I laugh every time I conjure up the sight of all the bar patrons sitting in their chairs with sunglasses in the countdown of the lights! Maybe it's just the blood of my Mendocino county, but the Brits definitely hit it right! 10/10
