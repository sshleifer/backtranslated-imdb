GOJOE takes a while to get used to in the beginning, but the end result is very satisfying. The tale, about a murderous samurai who seeks redemption by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. There is much at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The movie may look a bit like another anime-inspired Samurai movie at first, but it ends up diving into more mature / adult territory soon after. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the best samurai movies to appear after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)
