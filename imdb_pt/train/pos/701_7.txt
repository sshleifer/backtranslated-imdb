I did not know what to do, so I guess it was much better not to have spent too much time. Do not get it wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively young director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of praise for making this movie. You can say that it has been an act of love for her. The acting (out of Dominic) is a bit tacky and the quality of the film is not great either, but for a low budget film it's fine. There have been times when the plot becomes complicated and there are parts that creep along, although I do not think that this greatly diminishes the ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say for that. The gag reel was fun, I will not ruin this, but there is a particular scene that makes buying the DVD worth it just so you can watch it over and over. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know Dominic fans will appreciate this little piece of heaven.
