I could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie, and I believe this is a sample of how short most viewers are in the world. Really ... Are you forgetting that Cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it just entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not so easy the entertainment you get in movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you hate it so much: because it does not try to please you. It's just a story, very strange, I admit, but after all, it's just a weird story. It's not a great story, not even a great movie job, but I think it's worth a 7-star rating just for the courage of both the author and director to film a story that is not meant to please audiences, selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer. This film is, for me, a European-style film made in the USA, and everyone involved in the creation deserves respect. Be it for the courage, or for the unique sense of humor.
