I'm giving ten out of ten, it's one of the best movies of all time. Absolutely crushed, stunned and stunned by the whole picture, wonderful game of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the whole crew, incredible plot ... Just look at yourself and get your courage to admit, touched your soul because it is strange, but there are all the answers you're looking for ... The best, mr. Ritchie! The best of all. Those who were looking for a simple confrontation and skirmish scream that they are disappointed. But there are many shallow films in Hollywood these days, you can not remember what happened the next day. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly hope that it would be possible to portray such a clear and genial image of myself, of all who would watch it. Absolutely unsurpassed, amazing, stunning ... You can get a vision watching this, I have no doubt about it. In fact, no word can express my admiration ... I'm still wondering how it was possible to record such a movie after years of Hollywood junk we were watching. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, it's simply the best.
