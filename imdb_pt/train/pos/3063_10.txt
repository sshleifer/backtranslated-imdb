A director for the first time (Bromell) reunited a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle-aged, middle-class, depressed man-killer and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an amazingly interesting contrast to human nature. David Dorfman as William H. Macy's 6-year-old son is the most refreshing actor I have seen in a while. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written to him as a self-tortured struggling struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It is always good to see Donald Sutherland and here he is wonderful as Macy's insensitive father. The alternating audio track of movies is worth listening to the director explain how he chose the cast, the locations and filmed the film. The basic sound of the 2-channel dolby is suitable for this well-recorded movie. Cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any movie fan or observer of human nature will appreciate this, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
