Do not look for an overdeveloped plot here ... just sit with some popcorn and enjoy this one. A gallery of stars appears as the villains of the classic cartoon character in this live action comedy that features an incredible makeup and set design, not to mention the performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for kids and adults alike. out of ****
