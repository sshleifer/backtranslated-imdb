I've seen this movie only after hearing compliments about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience proved to be somewhat anticlimactic. But still, Alec Guiness energetically takes a wonderful cast in a joke, though stereotyped, through post-World War II industrial England. <br /> <br /> This is the familiar tale about the misfortunes of inventing the perfect product of everyday life. Remember the car that runs in the water? Remember the promise of nuclear power? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear, wrinkle or become dirty! Of course the fabric manufacturers and their workers are appalled at the prospect of being put out of business, and so the plot gets a little heavy. <br /> <br /> Guiness makes the whole company worth it, and seeing it blow up a factory research lab over and over again is a blast! (These Brits ... always with their upper lip hard when they're under fire.) The film may be released just like the silly invention of Guiness, but it's a good ride anyway.
