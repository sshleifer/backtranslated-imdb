IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that puts the greatest and deepest scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light and thoughtful film. You do not know exactly how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to cultivate nascent love, but at other times you hear them discussing some of the deepest space / time puzzles of our era. The end result is a fun movie with surprises everywhere. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a weird mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of an uneducated worker who is fascinated by science. All together, they create a farce journey through love and science, mind and heart.
