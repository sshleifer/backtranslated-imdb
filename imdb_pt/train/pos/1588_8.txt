* What I like about SPOILERS * Teen Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) will live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she does not know half the crazy things that will happen to her from now on, not just to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), boyfriend of Valerie Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you do not have funny bone in your body, please skip it; if you like sophisticated veeeery only comedy this is not for you; if you like a funny, sometimes heartwarming show with two hot guys who can play the lead (and none other than Popular's 'Mary Cherry' - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what are you waiting for? ? You're welcome to Tyler's House! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
