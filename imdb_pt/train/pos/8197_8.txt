**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go on , make my day!' <br /> <br /> The fourth image of the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who was rumored to direct most of the Magnum Force) and he brings back the violent society of the first two films. However, the film still lacks impact and credibility. This film was released in the early 80's, the time of Regan and the young republicans. The premise of a raped woman getting revenge on her rapist does not appeal to that period of time. This plot would have been better for the Enforcer, who actually would have made a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a plot like Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION: 3 STARS
