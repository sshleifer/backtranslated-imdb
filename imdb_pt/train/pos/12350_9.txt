I'm not sure how I missed that when it was released, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This film takes place around the 19th century red light district in Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of the samurai code of Japan. <br /> <br /> It is exclusively Akira Kurosawa! Even though he died before he could direct this film, his adaptation of the screenplay shows. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is recognized and sheds light on how these systems interact with one another. The characters can spin around each other, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world in which they belong. The samurai warrior who enters the world of the prostitute of heart and love returns to his life as she embarks on a world. another road with a man who is part of his caste system ... lower than the lows. Many cherish the world of the samurai above all others, but nevertheless, it is the inhabitants of the lower caste who can support each other and who can love without restrictions. The samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak, while classless lovers prove to be the most honorable. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. It is a tale of women's survival in feudal Japan. During that period, men were the survivors ... the strong, while women were just stupid and weak property. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to do to survive, and how their strength allowed Japanese culture to continue as it did. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The Sea is Watching" for who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if he is not a fan. It's an adorable, silent and soul-sustaining film, and one to be treasured for any movie collection.
