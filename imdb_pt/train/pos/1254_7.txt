Ed Harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen from anyone with whom he shares, and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little hypocritical, comes to life only in the scenes when Harris is questioned by the lawyer of another convict. It's breathtaking, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> The other cast members are all adept and Connery is dependable, just like Fishbourne, but the story itself does not pack. The plot largely depends on the premise that a black prisoner will always be mistreated and coerced by white cops. This is the engine that drives history, right or wrong, and makes us feel a little cheated in the end. <br /> <br /> Still, it's worth watching to see Harris in action.
