Being that I am a true product of the generation of dance electronic and hip-hop music, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some ways as Wild Style, is a movie that will surely bring the heart-chord of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban music based on DJs and electro clubs. Although I admit that sometimes the dialogue is a bit extravagant, you can not help but feel for the characters, and finally "I wish you were there" to the beginning of hip-hop culture in New York. Town in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-time real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is as essential to the archives of a hip-hop fan as any classic album. Watch some of the movements of the slow-motion circuit breakers, if possible, to really appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All compliments due to the Zulu Nation !!!
