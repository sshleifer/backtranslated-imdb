Although this film is somewhat sanitized (because it was made in a time when people just did not talk about sex), it's an extremely useful film to show pre-teen girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was paid by the Kotex company, although what may surprise many is that Disney made this movie - as they did a lot of educational films during the years 1940-1960. As good as the movie is, I think the filmmaker missed a real opportunity. Instead of the nice voice of the female narrator and the relatively mild visuals, it would have been great if they had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know this would have given old Walt a heart attack, but wow, that would have been a great movie! By the way, although the notion of sex is only hinted at in the film, it adequately explains menstruation in general. However, missing some details (especially about intercourse) that I assume were included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now, if I could find out why I watched a cartoon about menstruation.
