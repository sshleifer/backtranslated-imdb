The first two-thirds of this Betty Page fetish model biopic is very interesting. Betty, portrayed with great sincerity by Gretchen Mol, seems like a nice kind of girl next door, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there was certainly nothing wrong with that). Director Mary Harron, who also shot "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white images with new black and white images. When Betty arrives in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and skillfully executed. The first suppliers of fetish material are not portrayed with much condescension and we have the feeling that these people were part of a restricted "community". Betty never had much trouble with her notoriety, though we have the impression that her reputation has prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the world of direct acting. As the third act of the film is practically nonexistent, we get the impression that we watched a full-length documentary about Betty Page, rather than a structured drama. Failures aside, it is a movie worth capturing and represents another beautiful feather on the cover of producer Christine Vachon.
