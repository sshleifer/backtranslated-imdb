We can only imagine the movie that Mr. Welles could have ended without the interference of the studio! This film is an imperfect Welles, but it's worth every minute of it because you can see the greatness of perhaps the best movie director in America of all time! <br /> <br /> We can see the toll that led Orson Welles to film this movie. The story has many holes, perhaps because of the demands of studio executives who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions sent to IMDB comparing Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, to Woody Allen, when they should be all those directors who are to be seen as followers. of the great master himself. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. Thankfully we still have his legacy in retrospective looks like what the Film Forum in New York has just finished, or his movies on tape or DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth was never photographed with love. than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, like blonde, she is simply dazzling to words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles's body of work was his own appearance. If he had focused on the direction and had another actor playing Michael O'Hara, a different movie could have been achieved altogether. Orson Welles must be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the studio camera to the street. The visuals of this film are so incredible that we left the theater after seeing this movie really impressed by the work, vision and talent it gave us.
