I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005 and the 14 films I saw there I would rate this as my # 3 movie. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent with many of my ancestors coming from region of Norrland, Sweden, where it was filmed. I also grew up in an area of ​​rural woods in northern America, where many small towns were very similar to the setting of this film. It's good to see more movies using rural locations as your settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a very good film and I'm sure a very difficult film to be made along with its great cast, but director Kay Pollock really got it after an absence of almost two decades of direction. Helen Sjoholm in her cinematographic debut as an actress was fantastic and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I liked Michael Nyqvist in leading this well-rounded cast. I recommend this movie and I rate it as 9.0 on a scale of 10.
