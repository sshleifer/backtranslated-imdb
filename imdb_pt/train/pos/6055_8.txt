I was not expecting much from this movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and funny and very well observed. The central trio of insensitive cyclists was surprisingly kind as they staggered and closed their eyes on their drug-fueled trip to Wales. The humor was gentle and subtle, as indeed they were the three characters (testifies his sympathetic treatment to the shop). The atmospheres of Wales were captured to perfection and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Intelligent and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic picture of the alternative culture - I felt that I was there with them. Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you would expect from a movie about motorcyclists and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a little stupid - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But overall, an unexpected treasure of a movie.
