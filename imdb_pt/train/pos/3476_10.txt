Let's get right to it: if you're a baby boomer, you inevitably spend some time imagining that in 1976 McCartney had the good sense to visit John's hermit town and spend the day with him. You also certainly wondered how things were going. I've heard exactly the same reports the writer of this film has heard, from John and Paul's perspective, and I admit that I rebuilt the meeting in the same way this movie does. But none of my imaginations could have bought tears in my eyes in the same way as this incredible work and acting. I found it incredibly realistic, perfectly plausible and 100% saccharin free. Now, can anyone explain why I have not heard of this masterpiece before being shown by CBC last night? I mean, she's three already, for Christ's sake! And yes, if you're a Beatles fan, this is a must-see! Even the subtle paraphrase of the Beatles melodies in the background is inspired.
