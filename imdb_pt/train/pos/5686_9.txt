July 1, 1981: Five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) are attacked while they are sleeping and brutally struck on the head with steel pipes at their home on 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. Main suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), ex-king of the porn, owner of a stick of 30 cm in length, and now an addict without hope. <br /> <br /> Investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating the case and try to decipher it with the help of a witness who claims to know that John has at least participated of the murders, David Lind. (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's boyfriend, and trying to get a testimonial from a witness of Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), the 19-year-old girlfriend of Holmes and Susan, who unfortunately does not remember anything but shadows about her night her husband's head was battered and hers almost suffered the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a prominent drug dealer (who is always close to girls like Barbie (Paris Hilton)) comes on the scene as a suspicious planner. of the Wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, knew anything about it? 'Wonderland' is an intense and taught thriller, a desperate love story and a story of the sad decline of a man, all in one; there is a clever use of Rashomon's technique (we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (though very briefly) and Sharon), a good direction and a great script, for performances, especially Kilmer, who takes the central stage with his impossible, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas, whose Launius is strangely appealing, the strong Sharon of Kudrow and the innocent Dawn of Bosworth. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
