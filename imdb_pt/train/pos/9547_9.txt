This film is the first cinematic experience of several people in the cast. All of them are experienced actors and have played in various series and TV shows. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's kind of weird seeing him in a thriller while he's at the height of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot of Togan Gokbakar and practically the first experience as director. But everyone did a good job. We are happy to see a young and enthusiastic cast. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay being longtime sweetheart of Sahan Gokbakar, is also a talented actress, who is known for her recent play in the play "number 27" and several TV series.
