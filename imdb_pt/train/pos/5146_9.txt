As someone born of a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from a unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis from one side of the family and the winners from the other WW2. This miniseries can not dive into all parts of Hitler's psyche and should give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and in the best possible way to Hitler's state of mind. In this series does very well. Carlyle is very good, like O'Toole, I would like, however, to have more information about relationships with others at the party, because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him who followed him to the letter many times without question and certainly no doubt later in his murderous career. What was going through the mind of Goebbels, Goring, and Hess? It would have been useful to see more of these relationships. But I hope this will get people to research more about it. It can also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not remain in power.
