I consider myself a great admirer of the works of David Lynch, as he offers viewers absolutely unique films with typical "Lynch elements". Having seen most of his work, I naively thought I could foresee Lynch's next move. I was completely wrong. Dumbland is something I could never imagine under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to contemplate this extremely primitive character, and concluded that all the absurdities, cruelties, brutality, and disgust presented here reflect bits of reality, being emphasized by distorting it. There are things in our lives that we hardly emphasize because they are disgusting or horrible, yet they are surrounding us, so I dare to say, Dumbland concentrates on those pieces. This is not a movie to have fun with, although you sometimes laugh at a strange and perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all the things we prefer to reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Accept it as it is, you do not have to like it. It just exists. And finally, if you're aware enough, you'll find typical Lynch elements as well. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
