One of my favorite "home" movies. I do not know if there are any people in our country who have not seen this movie! It's funny, and sad at times ... I do not know how people around the world (who have had the opportunity to watch) accept this movie because you have to know a few moments in our history and Serbian character of the Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, in order to understand it! But as I see here, there's someone from Canada who watched ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to figure out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Congratulations.
