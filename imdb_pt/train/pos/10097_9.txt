One of the first OVAs ("original video animation") I've ever bought, it still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A sci-fi cyberpunk comedy against an improbable scenario (for comedy, that is) of pollution of the near future in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of the Supremacy are the Tank Police, formed with a philosophy "if we can not conquer crime, we will have larger weapons," and which are, as the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and that are actually far more dangerous than any criminal are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these policemen are borderline psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the expression "loose cannons". <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and entertaining are your opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his hunter. (wo) men, the Sisters of Twin Gemini, whose existence always seems to involve the difficulty of the Tank Police. <br /> <br /> Animation is not the state of the art, but it is very good otherwise; the colorful palette and the caricatured visuals of the characters and wick fit perfectly with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> Dubbing in English is again very fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they've done a soundtrack album yet ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Dominion Tank Police is great. It is the Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy, full of characters and completely exaggerated situations, ensuring that you will never take yourself seriously. Highly recommended.
