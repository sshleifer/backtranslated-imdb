This is the best movie ever created. It's a masterpiece that brought a tear to my eyes. I will never forget my experience watching it. I do not understand why people do not think like me. The dinosaur turns into a performance that resembles De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator combined. This should be released on DVD in the Superbit format so that I can take full advantage of how it was made to be enjoyed when they were produced and filmed. Whoppi Goldberg really transforms into the performance of a life like a tough tough cop who is against his will joined a hot shot dinosaur as his partner, then the hi-suck follows to say the least. By the way I'm saying the opposite of what's true, this movie is total crap.
