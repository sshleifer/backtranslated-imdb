I went to a screening of the film during Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and made a brief introduction. The film rolled and from the first moment I was impressed: a long and continuous film of a futuristic Paris in glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I should not continue with the details because I think it's a movie worth seeing. The history of science fiction can be found on average for many ... for me it was very good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. Things you would not be able to do or see are performed beautifully. The performance of the cast is good, in my opinion nobody hits the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now, the thing that I found incredible is the animation. 3D graphics look like 2D. A BW comic brought to life. The details in the backgrounds give more texture as if they were made by hand (I'm sure it was, but when the angles change, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer on the show talked about the hard work behind the movie: 7 years! The director, she said, is brilliant, but maybe he was quite inexperienced, since he only had a short film on his resume. So many people had true faith in them. They started their own studio from scratch and have since faced the challenge they brought. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater for the final look of this movie is superior to his, I think.
