In the year 1990, the world of Disney's TV cartoons was certainly at its peak. Shows like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the Disney afternoon. This drawing is called TaleSpin. It's about the old Jungle Book character, Baloo the Bear, when he gets a job in the airplane business. In the series, he meets Kit Cloudkicker, ex-air pirate and good surfer in the cloud, businesswoman Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you may not understand as a child but understand later in life. This is a cleverly written series and is great to add to your DVD collection. Fathers, buy this for your kids instead of letting them watch all those awful Nickelodeon designs. If you liked TaleSpin, then check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Turn!
