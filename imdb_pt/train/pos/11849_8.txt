If only ALL the animations were great. This film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: History and Character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personified. I felt it for all the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. Beautiful animation and 3D animation did not work better in any other movie. This is a great movie for children and adults who want a journey of classic hero. 8 out of 10.
