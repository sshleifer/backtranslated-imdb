Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still has game! A few years ago, he filmed "Find Me Guilty," a proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can really act, if he has the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But he's still strong, his next movie already announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stick with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, its performance is top notch. The small nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or situations that evolve throughout the film are simply incredible. The frame (time) of the film, which keeps the toes all the time, blending timelines so perfectly, that the editing looks natural / flawless. The story is heightened so although even in a "normal" time frame, it would have been at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! : O)
