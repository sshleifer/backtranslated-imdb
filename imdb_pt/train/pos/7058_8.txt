Shortly after I saw the movie, the true magical sensation of the Walt Disney movies came to me and I realized that it was a long time ago that I saw the 'real' magic in a movie. <br /> <br /> The combination of the right music, speeches and magical effects brings the feel of Disney back to your body. Very special things I saw where the unknowing effects of the movie began with the Disney logo turning into Cinderella's castle and ended up as an old story telling fairy tale with her grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic returned in me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
