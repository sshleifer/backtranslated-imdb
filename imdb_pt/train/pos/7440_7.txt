I only saw the movie, and the scariest thing was that the people talking during the movie sounded like the actors. The film had its moments, but also stayed behind and became quite sick. Everything was meant to be a scam, but once you see the pathetic life of the people in the movie, you think to yourself "People like this are around us" All attempts to gain public sympathy are thwarted when the actors they do one stupid thing after another. On the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I'd wait for the video, but it was a good laugh. WARNING- Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not a beautiful sight!)
