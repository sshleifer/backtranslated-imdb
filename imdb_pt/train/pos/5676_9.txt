THIRD SERIES - BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want something done correctly, kill Baldrick before starting" Hot on the heels of the second series The show has returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and service as a butler to The Prince Regent , a vain and stupid fool for the poison of Blackadders, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comic puzzle. The format is similar to the previous show, after all they had now found the winning formula why change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich on the naive ruler's back in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick a master or trying to chase away a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent took control of the throne during his parents of madness and some of the satirized characters say a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all go through the events and everyone can steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
