Now for all the movie buffs out there, this movie may not be at the top of your list of things to see. But if you know anything about plot development, deep truth and the intentions that this film had, you would understand my pov. <br /> <br /> Granted, the details of the film are renderings of the writer, who did not you can expect to know what will happen in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and justifiably "scares" viewers into thinking about what it can be. I am a Christian, not because of this movie, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The movie and the potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed can impress someone in their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to frighten people into believing in God, but rather a means of getting their attention. As a Christian, I know I will not be left behind, and thanks to films like that, I can look beyond the superficiality of the film's entertainment, acting, and budget to appreciate the depth the film has to offer. This is a movie that you should not only see but feel with your heart and soul.
