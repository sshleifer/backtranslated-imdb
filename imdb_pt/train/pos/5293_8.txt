This is a very light comedy about a wonderful family that has a son named Pecker because he uses Peck in his food. Pecker likes to take all kinds of photos of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, and manages to catch the eye of a group of photographic art lovers in New York. Pecker has a cute sister who just gets mad about SUGAR and is actually an addict, taking spoonfuls of sugar out of a bag. There are scenes of men showing the lumps in their jockey with grinding movements and girls doing pretty much the same. It's very difficult to keep your mind out of the gutter with this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie to give you some laughter in a simple picture taken in 1998.
