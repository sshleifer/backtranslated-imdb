A Christmas Together really came before my time, but I was raised in John Denver and the songs from this special have always been my family's Christmas music. For years, we had a crackling cassette made of a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I finally managed to find a video of him on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for 21 years, I was able to see John and the Muppets in action for me. If you get the chance, it's a lot of fun - good music, poignant and tacky. It's also interesting to see the Muppet versions of the '70s and compare them to their latest versions today. I think Denver really had a little bit of heat to do a show like that - I think artists usually do not compromise their sing-long footage with the Muppets, but I'm glad he did it. Even if you can not track the video, the soundtrack is also worth it. It has some traditional Muppified favorites but also some original Denver songs as well.
