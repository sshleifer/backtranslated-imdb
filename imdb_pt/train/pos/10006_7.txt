In this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on real events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and talk-show host late into the night, is captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his foster mother (Toni Collette). doubts arise about the story of this boy, however, Gabriel finds himself involved in an ever greater mystery that hides a mortal secret? <br /> <br /> You really should stop reading those comments, and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> "How did he lose his leg?" ending with Ms. Collette planning her new life, she should be cut and sent to the "deleted scenes." It's an exaggeration. The true nature of his physical and mental ills should be obvious when Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly his blindness might be in question - but a revelation could be made with certainty in the scenes "highway" or "video tape". The film would benefit from a reprint - what about a "director's cut"? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (like Jess) do not initially seem credible as a couple. One or two scenes setting up your relationship may have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong character and not a "gay imitation". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Collette's "Donna" belongs to the scary hall of fame. Mrs. Oh is correct in saying that Collette may be, "you know, like that 'Psycho' face." There have been several years in which organizations giving performance awards seemed to reach out to women because of less dispersion of roles; Surely, they might have noticed Collette with some consideration for the prize. She's so good. And director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock - he even makes a sandwich from a vending machine come to suspense. <br /> <br /> Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere. > The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
