I saw the movie with two adult children. Although not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was very good. In a movie theater surrounded by kids who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know all the kids liked it. There the parents also looked compromised. Death and the apparent death of characters caused the appropriate sighs and comments. I hope people realize that this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful, although I enjoyed it as well. Personally I liked Scrat !!
