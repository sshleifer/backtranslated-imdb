It's been a long time since I've seen this mini-series and I'm happy to say that your remembered merits have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of 'A Perfect Spy', the adaptation of LeCarré's best novel, in my opinion, are top-notch. Its main aspects are the soundtrack and the masterful script, the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft, who was also, I believe, the writer of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' with Alec Guinness a few years before. The actors are mostly very good, some superb, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes at every angle of the camera. The passage of time and effects on the physical appearances of the characters are done in a very believable way. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only jerk comes after the character of Magnus Pym is transferred from the very capable hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a very old Peter Egan, fresh out of Oxford. But this is a small and unimportant whole. <br /> <br /> Egan only finds it difficult to be convincing when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be emotionally upset, that is, to cry. None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments, plus the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all she deserves and steals the episode with ease. Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym. She has part of the character under her skin, but often displays an amateur petulance that diminishes her as a difficult diplomatic housewife, which Mary Pym is. Rüdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel, fun, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's tour as the Baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of Americans is vividly presented in some hilarious scenes. When the Yankees go out to confabulate with Bo Brammell (MI6 chief), the American contingent is portrayed as an empty-headed clown who seems to have memorized many long words from the dictionary and generously seasoned them with American jargon and psychotic babbling. , much to the disdain of the English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are subtly mixed. LeCarré has an ability to blend disparate elements into his stories, and Hopcraft brilliantly captured the melancholy yet melancholic atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> It is not a perfect production (what is it?) and yet the best of the LeCarré adaptations to reach the cinema or television so far. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all espionage thriller lovers and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available on Acorn.
