Despite some negative comments that this movie won on the IMDb pages, it is still worth taking a look, as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while on a difficult mission in the Panamanian jungle. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us to watch this thriller in Panama. The film has some good moments as Beckett, the veteran marine, takes a newly arrived man recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel boss and the corrupt army general who may be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what has been entrusted to him. <br /> <br /> Miller, the arrogant newcomer to the jungle and guerrilla warfare between the military and the drug dealers against the infiltrators. American intelligence men, learn a valuable lesson from Beckett. What sounds good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle. Tom Berenger, is an actor who does not register much, as he proves in this film, but in the context of the film, he is sure as a man of few words. Billy Zane, playing Miller, does what he can with a role that gives him no glory until the crucial end. For action movie lovers, "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action that with a little cut would have made a movie more satisfying.
