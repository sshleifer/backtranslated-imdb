When I first got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I LOVED it! The graphics were great for your time, a good storyline, great courses and above all, the best music I've heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I do not completely remember the plot, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario has to rescue her. The game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle. Each had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are secret parts of the castle where you can get more stars. But of course you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser in * Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character, and receives helpful advice from Toad, so he is basically one of his only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game. in the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are a lot of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Then how about people say that the game is more important than the graphics, and I completely agree. But with it great plot, there are great graphics. Especially for your time. I have a lot of other Nintendo games like 007 and its graphics do not compare with Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and awesome sound effects.I found the graphics in the water courses very, very good.Next to Bowser's world, have the best graphics in the game. <br /> Now the music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up, when I played this at a young age, I would be happy to leave the game all night so the music would put me to sleep. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay which was peaceful and wonderful. There are others that are great too, especially in, once again, the worlds with Bowser, they are the ones that trap me most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite past time as a developing player, and I love it. This game has 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5 ) GO PLAY THE GAME!
