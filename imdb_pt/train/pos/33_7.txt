This interesting Giallo stimulates a typical but still gripping plot, and a really sadistic killer who obviously likes to hunt down his victims before killing them bloody. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year before, also made the very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on this), the film starts a little slow , but after all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub-plots or sequences. This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but was released in Germany in video only in a 15-minute tweeted version under the stupid title "Horror House." At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy all husbands, are completely intact, and the viewer still gets the murderer's motive in the end. But the Italian version containing all the pictures is still the one to look for, of course. <br /> <br /> A compelling Giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended for Giallo. fans and a bit superior to the other mentioned Miraglia thriller.
