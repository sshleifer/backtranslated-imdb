The FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. His influence has been felt for more than a decade. However, certain elements related to how this wide-screen entertainment was directed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone, date it quite, and the sometimes slow pace of the movie does not help. But the compelling central idea of ​​the story surrounding Krell's ancient and extinct civilization and "Id Monsters" has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film a "must-see" movie. What I'm more interested in saying here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The film has never looked so good in home video and its elements urgently need restoration. I hope this happens soon and we receive a special edition of this SF classic.
