One of the biggest movies I've seen this year. Last maybe before sunrise, which is also seen late at night alone in the lab. I like the idea of ​​the movie, which suggests the free will of man and our weakness against fate. With time passed by James and Kathryn are bound to fail and an indescribable grief comes. I like the ending. but a great question also comes. The virus will not be released again, should it? <br /> <br /> In the last scene at the airport. Joseph is sent back to find James again by future scientists. When he tells him that the scientists have already received his message and know that someone would spread the virus. And the two together find Kathryn when Kathryn tells James that the real man is the DR. Assistant Goines. So it's clear that Joseph also gets the real information about the virus (James keeps an eye on it at the time, remember?) And he has teeth. So why does everything still happen? Why do future scientists do nothing after the truth is revealed? My biggest question after the movie ...
