If you are under 13 or over 13 and you are very drunk, you will enjoy the D-war. If you're a dedicated fan of all sorts of brainless action movies, you'll love D-war. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. After the film was over, all the children (my nephews and their friends) did not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Acting and driving are horrible. The plot is extremely simple. But as half the audience was children, they screamed, screamed and applauded every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to bring your kids, but other than the final sequel to the battle, D-War is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10 mostly because kids loved it so much.
