Viggo Mortensen stars as a new prisoner in a haunted prison in which the director (well played by Lane Smith) has a terrible secret that may be the reason why several guards and prison inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the soldier who knows the secret and is afraid of his life. When I think of prison movies, I always think of action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or high-profile dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect a more ghost story along the lines of Exorcist III. The arrest, however, is an atmospheric effort and certainly remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The film is scary and has a good performance from a cast of (at the time) unknown. Lane Smith is the best because his director is not the usual clich√© of evil personified, but nervous and restless, which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> (Good)
