A true dark noir film and a very graphic film, a nice story of a man seeking redemption, who may have left everything too late. Visually there are some really pleasing artistically amazing scenes about what can be done with a minimal budget. Full marks for Gareth Maxwell Roberts and team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although hopefully more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray looked lovely did not see her before and hope to see her again in the future. Subject all the interesting subjects about Sex, Drugs and Violence. May come. I would definitely say to rent this one and check if you are in the mood for a temperamental semi noir.
