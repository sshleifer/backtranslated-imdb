It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to gain an advantage and makes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it turns out that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the young son can help him out of this - as the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) gets the car and looks for help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for it. There is a double question that the film poses. How far would you go to help the man you love, and on the other hand - noticing Stanwyck's behavior toward the stranger - does she really love her husband? As a good tale, this film leaves the viewer with himself with questions that he can only answer to himself.
