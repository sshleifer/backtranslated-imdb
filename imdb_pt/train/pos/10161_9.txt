I got a flyer to rent this movie, but I have to say it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography and high production figures, etc. Proves that Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom / with above bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who assaults and calls acting. Who's going to think? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class on their own in this regard and should try to offer projects as good as "Over Your Dead Body". The Lake Bell is great too, and this is the first time I see it. And finally, Paul Rudd begins to shine in a really good movie instead of smaller movies. <br /> <br /> A movie like that never gets its debts from men with a closed mind. Is very bad. As other critics of the magazine here have noted, there is nothing defective about this gem - without writing or acting. <br /> <br /> And his portrayal of contemporary LA and California in general makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean and otherwise stunning in every way. Never before has a movie made LA seem so good. Oh, what a talent and a lot of affection they can do for a movie. <br /> <br /> I will not divulge the plot, but as a long-time and hard-core atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy the supernatural theme in order to enjoy a great and joyful piece of entertainment. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also so nice. <br /> <br /> This film exposes popular but otherwise banal films such as "Ghost", for the mediocre and overly sentimental festivals they are in. We already know that public tastes lean heavily toward the mediocre. Some of us salute our praise for what it really deserves, though. <br /> <br /> If you liked other gems neglected as "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich, etc., you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> First class work everywhere (even though it's hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for over five years). But even this plotting device does not detract from the importance of the film. global excellence.
