In the film Kongwon-doi, he presents a relatively intimate look at the meaning (as well as the general lack of meaning) in the lives of various Koreans; empty people looking for ways to fill themselves, taking advantage of the escapism of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film, we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn about their deficiencies and their desires, the general complexity captured in human life (and even the general simplicity of humanity). Although the film is slow, it can be very contemplative. He does not force any ideas, but allows ideas to arise about themselves, allows concepts to unfold. <br /> <br /> The movie ends as well and as suddenly as it begins, and one truly understands the meaning of solitude, this love is often an act of selfishness and the many mistakes we make. It is a look at everyday life, very well and very well done. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for action or intense drama, this is not the movie for you. However, if you like honest, original and meaningful films that are not forced and lackluster, this is a great movie to watch.
