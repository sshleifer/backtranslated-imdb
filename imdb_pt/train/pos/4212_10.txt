Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a rough, brutal, well-made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who accidentally acquires ultra-secret microfilms and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough guy who is used as a messenger by his evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good, its great character, the actress Thelma Ritter, steals the film. Like Moe, a tired street saleswoman selling neckties (and who also sells information), she looks great in a role that earned her another Oscar nomination. It's incredible that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Oscar and never won. This should have been the paper you copied for her!
