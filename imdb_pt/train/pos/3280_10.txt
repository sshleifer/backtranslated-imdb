I only saw this movie once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it, I think it's even better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than just a horror. He had an incredible level of emotion and a great characterization. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really great here. It's a shame she did not do anything else, since she was an excellent actress. Her portrait of emotion throughout the film was perfect with the right amount of subtlety to convey the message, especially in the end when she realized that although Marc had died, she knew he would be fine. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the strange radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke and fell apart. <br /> <br /> In short, an excellent and very moving film.
