As far as I know the real guy that the lead actor is playing he saw his performance and said it was an excellent picture, I would agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a well-endowed boy / man with a special body part helping him. Oscar and BAFTA, and Daniel Globe-Lewis, nominated for the Golden Globe, plays Christy Browna, a paralytic man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot, he can write with it, paint with it and hold things with it. He learns to talk later in the movie, it's very good for a guy like him. Also starring in the Oscar-winning Home Alone 2, and Golden Globe-nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA, winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated for Best Director Oscar for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Outstanding Material Based Screenplay and Best Picture, was nominated for BAFTAs for Best Picture, Best Makeup Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 in The Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 in Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 in the movie The World's Greatest Actor 28 in the 50's greatest British films. Exceptional!
