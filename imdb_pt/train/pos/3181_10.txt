I had the opportunity to see this movie premiere at the Appalachian Film Festival, in which it won a Best Film Award. This movie is brilliantly done, with an excellent cast that works well as a set. My favorite performances were by Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, which I was surprised to find that this movie was made on a small budget. Screenwriter and director Adam Jones, who I believe also won an award for his writing, does an excellent job with directing. The public loved this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see.
