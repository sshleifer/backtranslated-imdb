Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, the screenwriter and director of the highly acclaimed mini-long 2002 "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic, at 1hr 53 minutes, is another beautiful romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gays like me, need to be transferred out of our safe zone and be told real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity. While "Yossi & Jagger" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the confines of Israeli military service, "Ha Buah" is centered on a group of civilian, heterosexual, and gay friends who share a unit in the heart of Israel, generally tolerant to gay, but not always gay-friendly, capital Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> "Ha Buah" opens with a dramatic border checkpoint scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller ?? Yossi & Jagger?) meets the handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon blossoms ?? but in this political climate the opportunities would have to be quickly seized or lost. From there we followed an intricate interaction between the members and lovers of the housemates and the inevitable effect of the very conservative family of Ashraf. If you follow the dialogue of the film with enough attention, you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Ha Buah" is vibrant and the visuals are beautiful and hard ?? that is, real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and enjoy world cinema at its best.
