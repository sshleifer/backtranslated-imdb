Before you see, please make sure you have seen Night of the Living Dead ... This may be the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! "Special effects" absurd (the rope, the rope !!!) and slices of maniet bread ... what more do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Do not watch this movie while you eat bread ... you can be scared!)
