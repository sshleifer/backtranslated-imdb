This movie is good. It's not the best of the great CG kung fu movies, but it's very good. First, the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​gods against fallen gods deal with super powers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are many characters! It was very confusing when they switched scenes! The special effects were AWESOME! The fight scenes were very fast and complex. This virtually all computer generated movie. The performance is superb, as always expected from high level players. Ekin Cheng is an excellent protagonist and solitary character. Zhang Ziyi did not do anything for me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger party, but she did a fight scene and a lot of barking. The bad guy, all the army of skulls and the whole thing of the blood cloud is very scary. The music is also great. For me this story deserves at least one miniseries and not just ONE movie. There is plenty of history to cram in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This movie sacrifices the integrity of the story by action. I highly recommend Storm Riders on this any day.
