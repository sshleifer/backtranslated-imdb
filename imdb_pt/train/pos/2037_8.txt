Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is clear in his debut movie, 'Creep'. 'Creep', though somewhat loose in information, proves itself worthy of a true bloody classic. A little less brilliant than the recent horrors of the US (Horror remake of Amityville, remake of House of Wax) this dark and gruesome tale follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of subterranean tunnels and disused railroads while she, and a number of others along the way, try to run away from a killer attacker. Although some negative reviews have predicted this movie, I truly believe that on a tight budget and for a British production of the first director Smith, "Creep" really lives up to its name. It provides accelerated gory action more or less from the beginning, sometimes very fast, as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best reaction of the character in the end I've seen in a while, 'Creep' offers some scenes that are definitely a nightmare.
