One of the best (if not the best) view of Stephen King. Dark as the dark can be, amazing non-Hollywood ending, terrifying atmosphere, incredible book adaptation, excellent cast, educational (do not play with life after death), anyway - all a great horror should be ... /> My favorite horror movie, direct 10+.
