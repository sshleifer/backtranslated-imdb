Indian Summer is a hot, multi-character movie that would make a great movie in the afternoon (with a bit of editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past with a group of children showing a moose, which sets the perfect tone before cutting off the present, when a group of adults of the "golden age" of the camp is invited back to spend a few weeks vacation at the head of the camp, Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their moments at the camp, and form new memories in their last stay. <br /> <br /> The movie succeeds in the great way it brings your characters. in this stunning setting, and allows them space to develop without having to worry about the evolution of the plot. Watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is about what the movie is and why it works so well. It never reaches the top and is melodramatic, always maintaining its warmth, charm and realism. I've never seen a movie where nostalgia was captured so well, and I found myself being attracted, although I never went to one of those camps as a child. <br /> <br /> For a hot and nostalgic movie, I wholeheartedly recommend it.
