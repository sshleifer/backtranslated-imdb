"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for its frantic editing style and "sick" photography. His detractors cite their superficiality and criticize his use of "style over substance." I could not disagree more. I believe "Domino" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film career. <br /> <br /> Having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tony Scott progressively approached a more subjective movie style. In Crimson Tide, Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine were incorporated into the excellent use of long lenses combined with Dutch angle framing. This was then taken to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a shift to a more aesthetic expressionist of painting. Here, Scott used an old-fashioned camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive anger. Although not entirely successful, he introduced techniques that should find his full expression in "Domino". Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation "Domino" features the life of the infamous bounty hunter through his narrated disjointed fragments of memory. It grabs the memories as we all do - in fragments, flashes, and brief excerpts. As Domino conveys his story verbally, Scott transmits it visually, illustrating not only the events he describes, but also the point of view that guides them. She has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is in any way Unusual - that of a woman who avoided the luxury life for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> It is when Domino begins to relate the events that led to his captivity that Scott really does tear. Together with director of photography Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary American art. Gradually we begin to realize that although it is unusual, Domino is no more disjointed than the "90210" culture he rejected. As she walks through this cultural mix, Scott makes her viewer more aware of the innocence he destroys through the underprivileged children that the narrative introduces. Ultimately, Scott portrays his salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this film for being overly stylized is like criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing what is known as human. Like any great painting, the meaning in "Domino" is on the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not in any way associated with Scott Free, but I've always been and will continue to be a big fan of Tony Scott's work
