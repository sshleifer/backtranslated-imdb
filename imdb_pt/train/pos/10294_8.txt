Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, along with Jennifer Aniston, combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this season in 2003 (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's crazy and personally forgotten roles in past comedies. With a slightly caried tone down Carrey still with only the zap and crackling of her old self, Carrey powerfully takes this movie to the pinnacle of laughter and also some dramatic, weeping dark moments. Elements of Jim's real acting skills continue to appear in this film. This delightful summer entertainment hits most buttons, including dramatic elements and funny moments that fit perfectly into this script. While still lacking in the superbly polished set of comedy / drama, Bruce Almightly deserves credit for being a great date film along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that retains his taste for good nature. Eight of ten stars.
