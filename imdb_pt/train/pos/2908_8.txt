A journey of discovery, this film follows the lives of a family living in a quiet island town in British Columbia. Poor and dreamy, the inhabitants are content to allow life to continue around them until a young and new teacher with new ideas arrives and brings the life of the continent. Slowly his indolent state is awakened, the father (and headmaster of the local school) looking for excitement, the mother for stability, the eldest daughter out of love and the youngest for power. Although not an incredible or groundbreaking film, the film is quietly nice and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada can find it easily accessible.
