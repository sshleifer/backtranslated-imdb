Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into a fun and well made movie. Starring Sigourney Weaver as the director, Shia Labeouf as Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well presented, and the actors played their roles well. <br /> <br /> The movie had inter-weaving plots that everyone took to the end. The main plot is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second plot is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and is the deepest plot of the film. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100 year curse on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories were woven very well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many people's beliefs, I do not think you need read the book to understand the movie. The film is fairly easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (the director), and Jon Voight (Mr. Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Lula), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Axila) and Brenden Jefferson (X-ray), increased the film's comic relief. . However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with some serious issues like racism, shootings and violence. The dramatization of the film in some points is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages regardless of whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
