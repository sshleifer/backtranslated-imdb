Coming into this movie, I've heard good things about it. Leaving there, I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character like his other films. There was some laughter here and there - not very funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances on the club scene. I have to try this the next time I meet in a club. A couple of stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that girl from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it very entertaining to see an appearance of Thandie Newton in one scene. Of course she's in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see that as a throw up, you'll like it or even find it a little annoying. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is lovely in this movie. : 3
