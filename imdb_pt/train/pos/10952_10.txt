Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the forum material and people simply do not understand. Nothing that appears on TV is an accident. A lot of money, time and work are put into producing a TV show so there are mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is youthful because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile. I thought the jokes were great and the thematic show, like the other musical numbers, are wonderfully bizarre. It's a lot like the Pee-Wee Playhouse, for twenty-odd misfit and clumsy, Future Pornstars of America's Valley. The cast is incredible. Scenarios and action are well paced. I hope this show has been successful since Comedy Central did not allow David to continue his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? She is not in the cast on the series homepage. I would love to see you standing. Does anyone know about their concert dates or DVDs that may be floating around?
