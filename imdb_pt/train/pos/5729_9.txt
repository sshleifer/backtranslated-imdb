That's a bit of a puzzle to many of Lynch's artistic crowd. They tend to try to write this as a kind of parallel, meaningless project by Lynch. Thus, Lynch passes gas between his true works of cinematographic art. Well, it may be a fart, but it's one of those intriguing farts that you realize and are ashamed to admit they like. <br /> <br /> Distilled Dumbland is additionally art. What can you do with aspects of modern life, but laugh about it? If you were serious, you'd go crazy. You cling to it, smell it, provoke it, feel its agonies, your stupidity irrational and then express it in whatever medium you choose. This is called art, and art is not stupid. But it's Dumbland.
