The ghost train is a treat for those who enjoy the typical humor of the 1940s. It incorporates World War II in the plot, but not as much as I initially believed, and the characters are a unique blend that play their roles reasonably well. Askey, playing the role of Tommy Gander, is what illuminates the story for parts that could be portrayed as boring or "dragging". <br /> <br /> The story of the haunted season is really scary even for the present. patterns of the day. It's unique and the way the characters communicate with each other is fantastic to enliven the mystery that is the Ghost Train. Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members, while the rest goes very well. He is always the center of attention and can be dubbed "boring", but is one of those who do not appreciate the humor of 1940. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes it sweet to see. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Askey / Gander, this movie would be shorter in action, fun and the result would not be as effective my opinion.
