Normally, I do not watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually pretty alike. This movie had many scenes from stereotypical action movies, but the characters and originality of the premise of the film made it much easier to watch. David Duchovny doubled his normal approach to acting, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and did great acting. Great cast all together. A must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
