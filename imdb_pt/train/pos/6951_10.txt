I've never been a big television fan until I watched 24 for the first time. I joined the series very late. The fifth season ended before I even saw my first episode. It was an episode of series 3 that was in the box of my parents DVR (digital video recorder) while I was sitting at home for the weekend. It took an episode for me to be hook line and sink into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy was I addicted !! I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty dollars and needless to say it was the biggest blockbuster I ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. There are 72 forty-minute episodes !!! I'll say that figuring out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine the anticipation of attending the 6th season from week to week !! I find this a bit torturing and cruel, but I'll try it out and watch it like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet I'll be chewing the little !!
