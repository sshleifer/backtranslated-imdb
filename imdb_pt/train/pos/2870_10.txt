This movie is wonderful. Always was always will be. I mean really what is better than a maid fall in love. Walt really left alone. And the music! A dream is a wish that your heart makes is beautiful! What more can you say besides great! I can not wait until the special edition is released, it will be so incredible! I can not wait to hear all the deleted songs! This movie is made so cute and clever! It is kind. And about cute mice too! I know I keep saying the same things over and over and over, but hey, this is a great movie! Woods was fantastic in this beautiful beautiful and beautiful film.
