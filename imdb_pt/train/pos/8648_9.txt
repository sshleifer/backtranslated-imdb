Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road ever. The road without return. The plot is about a couple who set off to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that happened in America and his girl - who is a photographer - will take the photos. So they set out on a trail of famous murders without knowing what awaits them on the way. To share travel expenses, they decide to find another couple and place an ad. But the couple that responds is not just any couple. He is one of the strangest couples of all time. The girl is a naive and fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. Man is the exact opposite. A cruel, ruthless killer. We learned this early in the film and followed it along the journey to Kalifornia (not with C as usual, but with K, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey of betrayal, murder and ultimately defeat. All the protagonists, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed, not even one of them was a star. The picture is incredible, with darkness covering the biggest parts of the film, and the song adapts to the film's dark character. Overall, this is a very good movie. Do not miss it. You'll think again before you pick up a stranger in your car to share the gas!
