It's not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you're not 100% sure of your mental stability, because he'll be severely tested with this movie no matter how wise you are. I have to say that Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment movie, so most viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to get to their delightful side. More or less like Tarkovsky's films, but different in one way. I myself can not say that I enjoyed myself much watching. But it is a remarkable and very interesting experience for those who are only plagued by the clich√© that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger in his brain and scratches his mind. You can not just sit and watch, you will be using exclamations or looking with your eyes wide open throughout the movie. A movie that is similar to this style is the Nachtgestalten, but was considerably better and less violent. This, for example, is not for kids or for those who are mentally sensitive or moody. Most viewers would probably give 10 or 1 for this movie. I give 9 because I saw the phenomenon of several stories in one movie in another movie and it was better. But this is an excellent piece by itself. Worth watching, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
