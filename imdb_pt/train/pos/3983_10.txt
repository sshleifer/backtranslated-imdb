Totally deserving of its prestigious nomination for the Hollywood award, this is a fun little gem with lots of enthusiasm and some nice surprises. Extraordinarily funny scenes include a hilarious (and re-filming) shoot-out of a World War I trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as a non-with optimist and the unfortunate McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman messenger ?? all under the pale eye of Ralph Sanford's delightfully irascible anguish; a lost McDoakes guided and re-guided by Jack Carson equally perplexed; assistant director Chandler rejoicing at an opportunity sent by McDoakes: "I'm going to be director!" Comic O'Hanlon has a double role, playing both McDoakes and him playing McDoakes! Strangely, Richard L. Bare, who performs in one or more entries in the series, declined this opportunity here. In real life, Bare is a six-foot-tall Rock Hudson-like youngster, but here he is represented by a veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
