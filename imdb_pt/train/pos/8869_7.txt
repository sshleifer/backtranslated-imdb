In this little movie we have some great characters, but a very superficial plot. It's really nice to watch because Singleton does a great job of presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This causes the viewer to forget the nonexistent realism that this movie is supposed to be. In fact, what we have here are all possible cliches and stereotypes placed on the celluloid at a rate higher than that of soap. It's definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.
