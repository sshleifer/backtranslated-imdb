More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger outlet for their talents. 7:35 De la ma√±ana is an absolute genius. What Nacho is able to broadcast in 8 minutes takes some Hollywood movie hour directors to achieve. I watched it smiling, but feeling a bit dirty and not the sexual way. You sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min. nugget. I was entertained, but I was disturbed at the same time. Few people can do this in just 8 minutes. It starts out pretty simple. A young woman arrives for breakfast in her usual place. She sits down and someone starts to sing. From there, the movie takes you through so many different emotions at a time that is difficult to describe. It's in black and white, but it helps with the feel the movie gives you. This movie makes you want to know more about the characters, how they interacted earlier and how the ending impacted their lives later. I think it's like the old adage: "Let them wanting more," Nacho Vigalondo is able to do that. Watch this when you can. Show your friends and imagine how 8 minutes can be fun without undressing.
