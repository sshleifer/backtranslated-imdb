The House of Spirits is an exciting tale of family intrigue, South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring the romance of Isabel Allende to life with all her passion and suspense. This, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and matures with a lot of credibility, while Clara's Meryl Streep maintains her warm, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas form a beautiful couple who fight for the acceptance of the family in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. The interior of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's farm are effective and the period when US cars contribute very well to the post-war atmosphere.
