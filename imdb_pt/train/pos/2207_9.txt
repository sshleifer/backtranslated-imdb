Not a bad word to say about this movie really. I was not initially impressed by this, but it grew in me quickly. I like it a lot and I find it a shame that many people can not see beyond the fact that it was banned in some territories, mine being one of them. The film is delivered in the department of shock, blood and atmosphere. The score is a beautiful instrument of suspense. It seems fair that Chris Young was one of the best composers in the business. The acting in this film is of a high standard, if a little wood at some points, and the effects are very real and courageous. All of this is a great compliment to a good horror movie in my book. I have noted in some comments that the film got serious due to P.O.V's shot of the famous killer. And I ask: what is wrong with this ??? It is a classic photo that evokes fear in any fan of the genre and is great for keeping the killer's identity a secret. The only thing that keeps this movie from receiving the best grades in my book is that the surprise turnaround (revealed killer) is not treated more carefully, I mean it happens fast, although great performances make that credible. Also, PRANKS is a great movie (although I prefer the original title) and it's a pity that so many people consider it a cheap piece of junk. It's more than that, but only few know it as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of the early 80's slasher. What a shame ... It's a very good movie people! Believe me!
