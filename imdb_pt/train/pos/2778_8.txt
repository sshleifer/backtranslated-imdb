I saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! Bend it like Beckham is a pretty typical movie about the age of a rather atypical girl. This is the role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (this is football for us Americans). And even though she is much older than her character, she plays the perfect role. <br /> <br /> This is a friendship film - specifically Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate who also goes. for family matters, especially with her mother, who wears purple enamel and small loops on her shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lace panties and flirt with boys and fears that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess love to play the game and have trouble trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. They also, unfortunately, love the same man - Joe, their trainer (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes a certain tension in your friendship. <br /> <br /> In some points, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, scenes drag on for a long time, and this movie probably could have benefited from more restricted editions. <br /> <br /> But this was a fun movie about growth, culture shock and love of football. It is about empowering women, pursuing their dreams and supporting their friends. Funny, charming and entertaining, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and did. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10
