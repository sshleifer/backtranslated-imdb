Wow!! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), then I am surrendering now. In her short skirt, high boots and pronounced bust line, she's a real baby, even if her kind of zombie shadow comes and goes. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the sexiest of the series. Notice the realistic and revealing struggle with Bronson until he tosses it awkwardly in the jaw, ruining all the fun. Okay, I should probably leave my hormone response. <br /> <br /> This is a half-hour very well produced by the underrated force behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Of course, the producers want to lead the third season with an above-average entry. It's nuclear post-holocaust in America (we know why it's part of the invading force) and only the American Bronson and the Soviet montgomery are left, along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage. They wander between destruction in alternate moods, as we wonder how long it will take for biology to overcome politics, which, of course, eventually does (Bronson's luck). And that's about it. No real conversation, except for what Bronson has to say, which is very exaggerated. However, the script is still entertaining, and bold for its time, suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truckers (a popular Cold War era stereotype). <br /> <br /> Passing ... It's curious that Bronson (Buchinsky), Slavic in appearance, was scaled like the American and Montgomery looked brilliant as the Slavs. Apparently, it should be the other way around. My guess is that the producers did not want to put the American into the woman's physically weakest role regardless of appearance. However, there may be some of the fear or the atmosphere of the TZ always, but the episode remains very, very pleasant to watch in 30 minutes.
