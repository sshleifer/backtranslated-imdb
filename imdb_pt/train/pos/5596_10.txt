"The Tenant" is Roman Polanski's greatest film, IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this one is much more original and unconventional and absolutely creepy. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I've shown this movie have been very upset about it after, so be warned that it affects some people that way. Polanski does a great job, playing the lead role in "The Tenant," in addition to directing it.
