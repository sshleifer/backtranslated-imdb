When I heard of Sir Alec Guinness's death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-watching. What a wonderful and fun commentary the film offers, even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as luminous as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered lifelong favorites.
