The herd is unfairly defamed as a minor "Se7en" ripoff. There is really no reason to compare the two, except perhaps for the similar scenario in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Now that it's out of the way I'll know why The Flock is very interesting in some ways. It's mostly a piece of drama instead of a full-length thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sex offenders. In the beginning, you can clearly see that his work was the best for him. Evident in two scenes where first he is interviewing an offender and patting him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think about are his standard questions from his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the social worker mentioned above. His manner of performing his work is no different from that of a policeman, he carries a weapon and is constantly checking newspapers and provides information to the authorities if any of his "gangs" may be responsible for a sexual offense. He is also a person who has lost all the happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from demanding his own vigilant justice in his flock. Twice you see him smile once when he is apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after he has beaten a member of his flock. Like a thriller, The Flock is not so successful. A little confusing and with some annoying plot holes, but it has an impressive number of fixed parts. <br /> <br /> The Flock is a solid drama about a man doing inhumane work and in the end he has to work hard. to avoid being swallowed up by the abyss into which he surrounded himself. The world we live in is a very sick place, and the further we can distance ourselves from the worst, the happier this person is. Flock understands this point well.
