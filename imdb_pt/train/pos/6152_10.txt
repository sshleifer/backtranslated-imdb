Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best Disney musical adventure. I've loved this movie for over 35 years because it's so imaginative, clever and fun. Even in spite of the silly scenes of "flying bed", the other scenes and dialogues are magical and funny. Could they choose someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can not think of anyone more fit for the role. Redoing this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, despite having few roles in quality movies, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten these days. English cranky, cousin and proper - no one could really do clownery and pull it as gracefully as it does. It would be tragic to remake this movie because Tomlinson was deceased for a few years and no one could stand in his place and do justice to his character. Sweaters and dancing armor have a magical aura about them that other films with witches simply do not capture. I particularly like the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can. <br /> <br /> Bobbing together, swaying along the beautiful salty sea floor. Richard and Robert Sherman excelled in the musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road being one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that still holds until today !!
