This game is above all by now. I had the honor of playing mine on PS2, so the graphics were pretty good. The dubbing was above standard. The level of difficulty is right. Wesker has to be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion. The story surprised me and gave many twists that I did not expect. The only rating this game deserves is great.
