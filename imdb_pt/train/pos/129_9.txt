With stunning cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity, this film took me out of the simple but fascinating opening scene. The movie is very much like a dream, and I think that may be why people hate or love it. Characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is small and perhaps a little pointless. But these are movie failures, but conscious choices. The film is not trying to work as a story, but it is a deconstruction of the war movies of the 1940s. I would have trouble arguing that there was a lot of real substance in the film, but the film is a cinematic marvel that I was completely taken away. This is one of the most beautifully shot films of all time, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can fully understand why people would hate him, but I give 9/10.
