I just saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The tentative title was 'Dog Days'. The reaction of the public was mixed. Some people think that explicit sex and realistic violence are too much for them. Others genuinely seemed to appreciate how good this movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is animal poisoning, an old citizen's striptease, an orgy bathroom in a shopping mall, anal penetration of candles, and the harassment of the mentally incompetent. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like too much to deal with, then this movie is not for you. This film shows the most desperate and pathetic humanity. The banality of our existence is thrust into our faces with the greatest joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming mankind here. And why should he? This film presents excellent performances from all involved, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made in the film for some time.
