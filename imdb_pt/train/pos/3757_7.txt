As with a lot of guys at school, we should give a positive signal. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. Those two strange things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the dumbest and funniest in the whole movie. This is much better than the first. And yet for some reason I feel that something is wrong. Something big. Something important. I made a better house and girlfriends. No, I would say they are better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave it a 7 out of 10 because of these two robotic puffs. <br /> <br /> The Grim Ripper, do not be afraid that he is not the type to die, it's funny. When it fell from the sky I split a gut. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. What where they? Scientists No way.
