I thought this movie was very well assembled. The voice-overs were great too. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely worth the time and money to watch. Atlantis has some comedic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It's a film of any age you can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the "teacher" crazy or until he meets the crew for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was good too, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It's like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
