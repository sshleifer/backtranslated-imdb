A sharp political commentary postulating how a maturing story is what this movie is. The irritant is that it works effectively on both levels. It is not supposed to, but it does happen. This tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 Belgrade communist is a warmer heart. That's what you call classic cinema. Obviously, in 1953, Belgrade is not a dictatorial and fascist environment as hard as communist society is often portrayed. One can hear rock and roll, one of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba" title of the movie. But jeans can not be bought or certain drugs that are illegal to own. Contrary to a heavy criticism of a communist society, this movie shows how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as the four of us. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and she travel to join him, the piano that is taken from the use of communion of one of the boys, the sudden delivery of his house and rooms to their new companions because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is clear that they despise the fascism that communism has created while engaging in discussions with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed in his hands. All this leads to the actions they take later and to the memory of a fading time, as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie is worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but neither is anyone's friend."
