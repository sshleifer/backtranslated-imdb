I am and I was very entertained with the movie. It was my favorite movie of all time in 1976. Being raised in the 70's, I was so passionate about the visual and behavior of Kris Kristofferson, of course I'm not a film critic, but at the time I think it was very good. I really like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I've seen the movie many times and still love the two like Esther and John Norman. I'm a big fan of Kris and I see him in concert when I can. What a talented singer songwriter, not to mention, actor. I've seen him in many movies, but I still think of A star is Born.
