Like Tarzan, the Monkey Man (1932), but more. There is more of everything, more animals, more varied African tribes and scenes in which the thought must be, if it were good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan fights with crocodiles - the crocodile machine spins in the water like a roller, around and around, jaws hitting. Tarzan can kill him with his omnipresent knife, if the damn saur√£o stops. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a growing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people wearing big monkey costumes and elephants. In fact, they use much more friendly and trainable Indian elephants than Africans with fancy ears attached to their heads. The human story: another white man, worse than the rest, appears to join Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard. Tarzan will not show the way, so the bad guy shoots an elephant so he can follow him to the deathbed. Tarzan intercedes, and the bad guy shoots him, but of course he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone dies, Holt and the bad guy and all his "boys". People are expendable, especially Africans, and there does not seem to be much distinction between black comrades who die because they work for the white men who travel through the taboo country and the blacks who kill them. This must be Tarzan's last film before the Hays Code got Jane to wear more clothes. There are a lot of underwater scenes in which Jane swims bare and, although the light is blinking, the movement and the glimpses are very attractive. Apparently, one of Weismuller's friends on the Olympic swimming team did the nude scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, moves through the film using the same type of thong that Weismuller wears (plus a bikini top), showing a splendid glimpse of the thigh and hip. They still do not have to say much. They sleep together and go out with cool animals and stay away from the cities. No wonder they are happy.
