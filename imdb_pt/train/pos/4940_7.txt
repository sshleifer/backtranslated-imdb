This movie is about human relationships. Charming, funny and well written, with meaningful text. It seems Morgan Freeman certainly had fun on the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really like her acting. Woman like her is a good motivation to learn the Spanish language. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the cute Paz Vega, the vision is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about the direction of their lives. 10 items or less is about the enthusiasm of life. If you like this movie, see also The Pursuit of Happiness, with Will Smith and his son. This is not an action movie or a bare comedy. It's all about human relationships.
