I remember this show that became a regular show on a Saturday night. Sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunts who, as you can see, are witches and she is one of them. So, Sabrina must learn how to control human powers and use them effectively. She must also deal with the school of a ruthless rival named Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle ... The show was funny and fun. He kept the funnier Saturday nights for a 10-year-old boy ... and made him laugh out loud ... and flirt with 'Libby' ....
