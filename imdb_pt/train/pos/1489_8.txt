Overall, the movie is fine. I think Sepet is better than Gubra in terms of his story, his sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that touch me. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his very good acting. Bright. I can say that his acting is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really '' menaikkan 'my' bulu '' rome. "<br /> <br /> I love the music. the song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan" I just downloaded the song.Good. <br /> <br /> And say hello to Yasmin.The final credit of the movie makes me play again.We can see how the Yasmin really appreciated his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the International Jury Grand Prix at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1st stars.
