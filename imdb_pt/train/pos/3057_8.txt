Wow, I really enjoyed this movie, William H. Macy is great as the serene hitman Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Alex, a successful married man (like his father) with a young son, is going through a midlife crisis and wants to leave the family business, so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will sneeze Sarah from whom he falls in love. One day, Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch if you like mature and interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
