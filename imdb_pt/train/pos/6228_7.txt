Another fun, witty and musical RKO with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. Although it does not show the great melodies of SWNG TIME (although the final number "Face music and dance" is one of the best and most fair of the team), it is extremely enjoyable, since these two can virtually not miss the decade of 1930 Again, the plot is light and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger together is a paradise. These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in movies do in a huge love scene. Although there are better musicals of Fred and Ginger, this is certainly a must-see.
