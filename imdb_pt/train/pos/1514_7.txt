Featuring some of Hammer's stars, this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a home and the fate of its previous tenants, whose stories are told to a Scotland Scotland detective in search of a missing actor. <br /> <br /> The number one story, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who have just moved home and plans to stay only for a short time so that he can write one of their stories. romances of terror. He creates a demented character named Dominic, who is a very frightening-looking strangler, and soon finds himself going mad when he begins to see this beastly-looking man wherever he goes. After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is presented which frankly did not work for me. I will not ruin everything for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) stars the wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson, a man who moved into the house by his retirement and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum (who deals in the macabre) where he is very surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon after, an old friend (who also has a story with this woman) is in town on business and comes to see him. The two men are in a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than you see. <br /> <br /> Three star story one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid After moving home with his peculiar daughter Jane, the nanny he hires becomes very suspicious about the way Reid represses his daughter. Well, come find out ... if she knew what Lee did, she certainly would have understood. <br /> <br /> The final story is a rather cheerful vampire tale, starring John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson finds himself transformed into the same creature he portrayed several times in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pace and direction were very good, as was the most of the performances. There were good gothic touches here and there and an effective punctuation to complement the environment. This is a guardian and is highly recommended.
