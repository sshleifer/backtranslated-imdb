Patten does not seem to be the friendliest type and seems to resent the extra work that Fanshawe's visit will entail, the big empty house providing an endless amount of food, cleaning and maintenance for him.

The BBC's Ghost Story for Christmas series unfortunately ended its initial series of 1978 films with The Ice House, mostly based on the work of the great James MR. In 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and happily A View from Hill also marked a return to the work of James, whose ghostly writings haunted many generations of readers. Director Luke Watson, who is new to the series, may have worried fans of older films, but he returns to the period left behind by later films, which immediately set the tone for a great story of Ghost, his direction is guaranteed while he remains faithful to the film. The mood of the masters works and gradually increases the fear factor to a terrifying climax, while maintaining what the viewer sees at a minimum, thus increasing tension and mystery. The autumn landscape offers lots of atmosphere, falling leaves and the low-lying sun providing a disturbing backdrop to the ominous events that are to come. The cast must be said they are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles. The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye can not see, may even have influenced √Ålex de la Iglesia in his film The Child's Room 2006) the following year, with which it has remarkable similarity. I had heard mixed reviews of this particular film but I must say I found it intriguing at all times and even raised some hairs on my head and gave me some creeps, something that does not happen much these days, I find any negativity around of the film can only be attributed to its rhythm, which in my eyes is perfection, but for the modern public will be seen as deadly slow. Much time is given, even within its brief 40-minute length, to character development and plot expansion, and I must say it's one of my favorites and certainly one of the best films of the decade.
