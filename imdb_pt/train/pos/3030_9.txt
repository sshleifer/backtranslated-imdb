This movie has scenes that come back to me in the strangest moments - that intense scene with Mr. Muckerji telling Mrs. Melandez that someone he spoke to witnesses the girl being pushed out the window by a woman who fits IN HIS description - is one that rolls around - the way she keeps referring to him by name - in a Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and then when Boyer finds out she has just taken poison and gives him one last kiss on the side of her head before she dies --- it's delicious! "Fools - Fools - all my life" ... etc etc - you get the point ... I have to buy this one. I love the acting of Dan Seymour - he usually plays a foreign sultan or police chief and has appeared in Casablanca and many great photos.
