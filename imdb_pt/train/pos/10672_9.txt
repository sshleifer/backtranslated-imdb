Anyone who has watched this movie and reviewed it badly, I refer you to Roger Ebert's review of this movie. He is one of the most respected Critics in the industry, and he gave 3 and a half stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect, or spectacular, but I liked it. The Chorus Line is not so much a story, but a bunch of stories about the lives of aspiring Broadway musicians. I read reviews where people said that much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie. This is an incorrect view. It's another story, along with all the other stories that are told about each of the aspiring Broadway. What people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things that the average man does. And this I think is really the whole point of the show. It is to show not only the talent of these special dancers, but to give us some moving things to think about in general life. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star watches this movie with a great sense of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points, and sometimes gets a little confused with the rhythm of certain lines of the story, but after all, I liked it very much. Take a look at the movie, and then maybe you'll understand what I'm talking about.
