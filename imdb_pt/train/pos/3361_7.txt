I intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of Marcello Mastroianni, with numerous films of him that I have in VHS; however, given my merry Christmas marathon, I had to settle for just that! By chance, it presents one of his best performances - and he was nominated for an Oscar for that (with his own film being honored). This was also one of 14 collaborations with the other most widely recognized star to emerge from Italy, Sophia Loren; both, incidentally, are playing against the guy here - she's a glamorous housewife and he's a homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the main characters are reunited on the historical day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself is shown in long filming), but refers more specifically to the brief encounter of the stars in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, briefly, passion - although each one knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to the abrupt abrupt end of the film. . This is practically a two-hander (with all the other characters - except for the nosy doorman of the apartment block where the story goes in its entirety - which includes Loren's fiercely patriotic husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, appears only in the initial and final sequences); yet the tight scenario does not hold director Scola (for the record, this is his 7th film that I watched and I have 3 more on VHS) and the director of photography Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result - although essentially low . key - is far from being a theater: the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building, observing the procedures intimately or dispassionately, as the situation demands, but always in an intense way. <br /> <br /> The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars to be convincing, and both deliver (their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable); It is interesting, however, that while Loren has pulled away with prizes in his home territory, he is Mastroianni's outsider but not sentimental (the rather dubious film seems to equate his sexual drift with Anti-Fascism!) Which has often impressed the international audience !
