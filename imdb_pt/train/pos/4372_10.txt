Rob Roy is an underrated epic of passion and action! Some READING SPOILERS INSIDE. Liam Neeson gives an impressive performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best of his career. Jessica Lange is a perfect card as your wife Mary. They have the greatest passion and chemistry I have ever seen on a couple of screens. John Hurt gives his Tim Roth portrays one of the big screen villains. His rape of Mary is repugnant and distressing. He really is a magnificent bastard in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best sword fights of all time. scripted and tagged, and Michael Caton-Jones's direction is impeccable. 10 out of 10.
