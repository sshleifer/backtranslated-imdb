This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln (born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky and died in Washington, 1865). Ford's great film takes Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied law, common law and began practicing as a lawyer in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his record days, initial relationship with Mary Todd (Weaver), following the couple from their first ball and their exit to the candidate's congress. But it focuses mainly on a brother (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) accused of murder, the subsequent trial with amusing court scenes in court and the protection of his mother (Alice Brady). The Lincoln-Fonda as defending defender and Donald Meek-promoter are nothing short of brilliant. Henry Fonda's excellent performance as an idealist, traveling attorney from Springfield, he should star regularly for Ford from this movie, such as "Grapes of Wrath, My Dear Clementine and Fort Apache". In addition to sterling acting by Alice Brady as sad mother, she was a great actress of silent movies, but this is her last film because she died early from cancer. The deeds of Lincoln are developed to entertain deftly attractive. nostalgic longing for past things and old values ​​and describes their kindness, honesty and willingness. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a direct man who never varied the ideals of his youth. This American masterpiece is correct in both respects, as splendid biography and as magnificent drama.
