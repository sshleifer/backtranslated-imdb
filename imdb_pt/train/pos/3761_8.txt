Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is the continuation of the excellent adventure of Bill and Ted. His false follower of journeys almost directly after the first film, and does a job as good as, if not better, to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bad person from the future who is trying to kill Bill and Ted using evil robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with the grim reaper (death) and return their lives to normal. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film is top notch, and I even thought it's a little weird at times, especially the conversations of Bill and Ted, it's a great movie. The would-be rockers certainly made another great movie. Get it the next time you go in the blockbuster!
