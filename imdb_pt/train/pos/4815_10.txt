This is on my list of all time favorite movies! It's a fantastic and insightful film. It was historically interesting and great to watch! I thought that Emily Blunt's performance was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen by Albert. The costumes were beautiful and the scenery and scenes, like the opera house, were surprising and detailed. I just loved everything! I loved the childhood scenes where she is being bullied by John Conroy. And where the mother says she has to walk upstairs with an adult. Once again the writers did it! They produced this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> He deserves the awards he received. (Oscar and BAFTA beating Sandy Powell for costumes, BAFTA for best makeup and hair, an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Achievement, Best Makeup Conquest Award from the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Costume Design, also nominated for best actress Emily Blunt, CDG for Excellence in Film Showtime, Hampton International Film Awards for Best Narrative Film, PFCS for Best Costume.Sudbury Cinefest, Does not Say What to Do.VFCC for Best Actress, Emily Blunt. ) General: 10 wins and 11 nominations! That's really good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Take a look, it's really interesting! Personally, Rupert Friend should have received a prize.
