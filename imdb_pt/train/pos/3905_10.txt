witty. funny. intelligent. impressive. I was releasing channels late night years ago. I came across it and a fire started. I was staying up late every night and recording for everyone I know. a little. like 3 people out of the nearly 100 people I did clock it did not think it was as awesome as I did. the others were laughing so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. Run, do not walk. Check this out and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it's a win-win situation. I would like to have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we, as a society, need more .... stalks.
