A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels, it is believed to be composed of monks from the small island of Iona on the west coast of Scotland. Telling the story of a young apprentice of abbots who goes off in the woods in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless knight of pagan mythology. Hoping to recover a lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The movies of true beauty are in your animation. Shaded cell in a bright and inspiring style of deep complexity, resulting in an appearance of less simplicity. Deriving much of the artistic style from the brilliant Cartoon Network 'Samurai Jack' series, for its genius use of mark-making and depth of depth, Kels' Secret creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <The story can be intensely inaccurate and the lifestyles portrayed lack realism, but these facts are totally irrelevant as the film sets itself into a world of Celtic-revivalist fantasy and mysticism. The girl in the woods is a wonderful addition and, in my opinion, makes the image what it is as it slides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing as a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat of Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kels is an absolute delight. For all sexes, all ages, is a beautiful piece of family cinema. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to be admired, but instead pleasantly impressed!
