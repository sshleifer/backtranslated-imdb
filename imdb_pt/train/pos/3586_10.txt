I saw this for the first time when it debuted over ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. She fought alone is about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who likes to hurt girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she is raped, the clique turns on her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film chronicles Caitlin's struggle against an entire city, including a school that basically allows athletes to determine the social environment, allowing them to escape with whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best performers, and there is a real chemistry between the two. them throughout the movie. All the actors in this movie, which was inspired by real events, did a great job. She fought alone really captures the essence of what it's like to be in high school (at least in 1995) and have her self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10/10
