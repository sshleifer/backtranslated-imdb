This movie has not created any controversy in India (as far as I know) and its advertising was also kept low. Initially I thought this movie would simply be a waste of time since most Indian directors and producers used to change the subject, although it is very sensitive and adds a love story in the original story and spoils it all ... most Indian viewers would agree to this topic if you remember Ashoka Mangal Pandey, LOC etc. <br /> <br /> There have been so many films in India that they would become milestones or mega hits if the love story was not unnecessarily added. <br /> <br /> But the treatment is very similar to the movie Pinjar (also need to watch). <br /> <br /> If I tell you, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making a great movie ..
