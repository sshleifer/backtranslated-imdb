I think the Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequences ever, as if it was not the best of the three Lion King films! In the movie, Timon and Pumba tell us where they came from and had trouble fitting in with others, like Timon having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumba go to find the place of their dreams, find him and find him soon, and also Simba they create, but soon they must choose between the place of their dreams or help Simba to face his evil uncle Scar and proclaim your right as the Lion King of Pride Rock! Full of wonderful new characters like Timon Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was a lot of fun and was voiced by funk comedian Jerry Stiller Ben Stiller's father. Disney was clever to climb Stiller in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation and history and music Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride, although I admit I really enjoyed that too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel the whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and it's a lot of fun! 10 out of 10!
