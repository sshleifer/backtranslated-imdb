Orson Welles can hit me on my ass with every picture of him I see. Lady of Shanghai is at the same level as her other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. The plot may tend to be confusing at times, and sometimes seems to be moving perhaps a little too fast (about an hour was edited when the test shows went bad). It does not matter, though. You can not watch Welles movies and focus too much on the plot. Your direction defines what the great direction is. Almost any scene from this movie can withstand any other scene he directed. Check out the court scene. Usually they are stock footage that I can not stand. Case in point, try to sit through Welles's own speech near the end of Compulsion. In Lady of Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in that court scene. Notice that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the process. Or just take a look at the lighting of that scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian, and it's been used consistently in noirs movies and crime films of the time, but Welles gives it its own beauty. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the ability, a skill no one else seemed to have, to make a criminal film containing examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he was speaking Shakespeare or spitting hard lines, he had the power to shake the soul. 10/10.
