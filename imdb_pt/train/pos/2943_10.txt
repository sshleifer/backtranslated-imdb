I think this is still the best routine. There are a few others, such as "bringing the pain" of Rock, and "Men Are Pigs" by Allen who are hilarious; "Damon Waynes last stand" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no mistakes. All the jokes are funny and the 70 minute time limit is perfect. Just enough to last 20 years. I simply love how he allows the audience to be totally himself and unrestrained. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot Jim Carrey growing up, watching a comic more relaxed is cool. Do not put in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you are bloated. Thank you Eddie, God bless.
