I saw this movie when I was little - It was called "Glacier Fox". I was totally traumatized by it! Follows a cute little fox family around. The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the foxes. I also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while I was hysterical. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say it does not go well with all the foxes. I was used to Disney-type nature movies, where animals do not actually die. Oh, man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was too small and truth be told - all I remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one die. Rent it if you can, but do not show your children!
