After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally ends up inside an invisible ink bottle, which was part of a chemistry set. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so predictable results occur, meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry is often only defending himself, but often he has a sadistic trait that plagues the cat whenever possible , even when it is not provoked. <br /> <br /> Here, he makes Tom think that his eyes are cheating on him when cheese from a mousetrap. disappears before your eyes, or milk from a plate. Tom can not take it any more, so he tries to sleep with this nightmare, but Jerry sets fire to his paw! Dude, I hope little kids have no ideas watching these cartoons in the 40s and 50s! I always found Jerry, the mouse, more evil than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, generally, any damage suffered by a character is lost in seconds and it returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way when Tom learns the story with Jerry, and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located (like putting flour on the floor to see his footprints).
