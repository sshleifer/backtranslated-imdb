As someone already said here, all the scenes in this movie are beautiful. Most movies are fortunate to have a perfect scene, but Director Jewison does one home run every time. The cast got the right footprint in the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other song made a perfect match. Hard to imagine how they maintained the precise mood during the long production of a movie. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know mostly through his role as Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family until I saw him on that one and then on Broadway in the 1980s) deserved much more stardom than he ever had, and Aiello Losers Losers are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving praise to this tremendous cast. Has Jewison ever written about this movie? <br /> <br /> I'd love to read it. Hard to find out why the average rating here on IMDb is so low ...
