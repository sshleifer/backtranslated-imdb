Quite simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of the first season and not like it. I guarantee you will finish watching the season. So I guarantee you will watch the second season. <br /> <br /> Other reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. Locations in Europe are amazing 3. Games are mentally challenging 4. It is very interactive 5. In one episode, a player responds to another, desperate player: "I'm trying as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate, "not necessarily". <br /> <br /> You can find out ... who's the mole?
