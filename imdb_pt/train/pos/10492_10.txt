I saw Saving Grace shortly after it came out on video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex, but does not detract from the entertainment. It is full of comic moments and has a very nice quality for it. The characters are what makes the movie so good. Each one has its own peculiar qualities, which enhances the mood, and the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law come to mind. Outstanding performance was made by everyone, particularly Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were great together at some of the funniest moments. If you're looking for a good comedy I definitely recommend this movie!
