Cypher, by director Vincenzo Natali, is a complex and imaginative thriller that, while requiring some suspension of belief and a lot of concentration, manages to be a completely entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a stay-at-home husband with an arrogant wife, decides to add some spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at the high-tech company Digi Corp . His job is to travel to conferences throughout the country (under the assumed identity of Jack Thursby) and secretly transmitted the speeches returned to his bosses, through a small electronic pen. <br /> <br /> In reality, however, speeches are only a cover for much more nefarious activities. Morgan, along with the other conference participants, is being brainwashed. The drunk water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities. Once they are fully convinced they are someone else, they are told to apply for jobs at rival companies where they can engage in unsuspecting corporate espionage. <br /> <br /> But the Digi Corp plans are destroyed by the company. Intervention by Shady Liu, who opens Morgan's eyes to what is really happening. It gives Morgan an antidote to the mind by altering drugs so that it can withstand brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp. suspects that he does not believe he is Jack Thursby, he will be "eliminated." Morgan plays together and applies for a job at rival Sunways. <br /> <br /> However, upon arriving at his new workplace, he receives a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy. Fortunately, the heads of Sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to Digi Corp. and Morgan becomes a double agent. From now on things get progressively more complicated; the plot twists and poor old Morgan is not being able to trust anyone. In an exciting ending, everything becomes clear (but only if you're following the events very carefully). Director Natali takes care of procedures with confidence and certainly has a great ability to produce an elegant-looking movie for a movie. relatively low budget. He gets some great performances from his talented cast; Jeremy Northam in particular is fantastic - his portrait of the initially somewhat nervous Morgan is played to perfection. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to risk and I look forward to his upcoming projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
