Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and a lot of low-level comedy, and you'll get THE SOPRANOS, about a mob clan operating in northern New Jersey. It's almost as much fun as professional wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I really admire the complicated Tony Soprano, by James Gandolfini, a psychopath with an occasional glimpse of consciousness. I have also come to admire the contributions of people like Don Chianese with hoarse voice like the stunned but murderous Uncle Junior, Tony Sirico with silver hair as Paulie perpetually perplexed and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the dubious and difficult Carmela. Soprano. Violence is sudden and explicit, body counts are increasing steadily each season, but they are usually the smallest moments that matter most here. See Paulie and Tony's nephew, Christopher (Michael Imperioli late in LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in Pine Barrens and feel a cold and bitter night in an abandoned abyss, both convinced they had it.
