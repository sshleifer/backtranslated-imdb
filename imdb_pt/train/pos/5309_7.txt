The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It's full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the innocent Pecker (played so intently by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt ("he's a thief but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room. . <br /> <br /> The film makes a point of how each day has many riches to offer, and manages to do this without being too heavy. There is always a risk, when you make messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", of slipping into a kind of "holier than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these pitfalls, allowing the public to understand the allowing enough space for viewers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie mainly because it is so much fun.
