Personally, I think the film was done in a very professional way, I loved the choreography and the acting. The plot is also thrilling and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional, and what I liked the most was that it makes you think later. Antonio Gades has lived absolutely his role to the end, and I must say that is one of my favorite photos and Saura is a wonderful director.
