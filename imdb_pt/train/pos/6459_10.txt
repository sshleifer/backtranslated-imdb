Back to roots with "as it is in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes carve a message that appeals to all hearts. We have seen it twice in a movie theater packed last: pure love and joy within the music of a choir that is simple but full of power when everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the glitz of fame to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after fainting on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is drawn to the lives of simple people, hot and rough from the North. <br /> <br /> He wins hearts with music and gains the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Do not go see if you've been ruled for Hollywood. This stuff contains no extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
