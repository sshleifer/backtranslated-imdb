I am Italian and when I recently looked again at this film, I was surprised by its beauty: the first time I was 10 and I liked it, but today I can enjoy it with the adult mind and feelings. Now I can understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.), by that time passed. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Maybe this 'Odyssey' did not have English version because it's not funny enough ... it's not suitable for popcorn and coca. However suitable for Homero pathos and existentialist reflections. <br /> <br /> In Italy was recently released a very good version of DVD: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but it is only in Italian and without subtitles. Too bad: also the dialogues and voices of this movie are remarkable.
