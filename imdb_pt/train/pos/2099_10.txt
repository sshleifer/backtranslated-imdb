This is superb - wonderful acting, scenery, clothing, music - but, above all, history itself. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised there are no more critics about this movie - certainly one of the best of its kind. The 1980s. <br /> <br /> It is also a wonderful film to see together with the great "Random Harvest" which has the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - an English World War II unknown. The officer is in a hospital toward the end of the war, suffering from shock and complete amnesia with no idea of ​​his name, origin or place where he belongs - he proves to be a very wealthy man - when he "recovers." will not remember the years before the war - But then the similarities of the films end. <br /> <br /> My sincere thanks to all who participated in the film - particularly the actors Ian Holm. , Alan Bates, Ann Margret (who choice of big and amazing cast), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This one stays with you forever.
