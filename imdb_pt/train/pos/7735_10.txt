An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - ex-unbalanced boxer who has become a hobo, an alcoholic widow with sinister desires, a former police officer turned small villain and a sequestration plan destined to disgrace. However, the film never reaches a clich√© country, but remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are all superb, particularly the role of Bruce Dern as the evil rogue, Uncle Bud. There is tense uncertainty in the movement of the film that, intentionally or not, contributes to the dark processes. Highly recommended.
