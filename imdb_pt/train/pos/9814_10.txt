This Peabody Award-winning episode is one of Season 1's highlights, where a malfunction of the holodeck arrests Captain Picard, Beverly, Data, and a Starfleet historian named Waylan in a 1930s setting in San Francisco. This episode is an homage to Raymond Chandler's "Maltese Falcon," where Patrick Stewart takes on the role of Humphrey Bogart - complete with fedora and trenchcoat. The office itself is almost an exact replica of what appears in Bogey's "Maltese Falcon." <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect run called Jarada, which mainly communicates with a high-pitched buzz. Communication with this alien race is difficult, and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in his native language so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. The best part of this episode, however, is the appearance of the famous Hollywood actor, Lawrence Tierney, in the role of the bandit Cyrus Redblock. He was such a handsome man in the 1940s. Oh well ...
