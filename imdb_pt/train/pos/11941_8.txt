They are not impressed with journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from "His Girl Friday" or witty detective William Powell and daring Mrs. Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur detectives on Scoop. His crazy replica is more postmodern than post-depression, Allen's writing is replete with ironic self-deprecation and New York's old anguish. Shadows of old intelligence rarely occur, as when he, like Sid, the great magician Splendini, answers his past: "I was born in Hebrew persuasion, but when I was older I became narcissism." Johansson, who was born in Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, becomes a relatively good student of journalism, sometimes served, trapped in a murder mystery appropriate for London: a serial killer. The plot is a reworking of his recent London-based thriller, Match Point, to the sins of the upper class and the American Tragedy boat accident / Place in the Sun. In fact, Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name but a few other examples. I do not care if he rework; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals, and unfortunately, it is only a reflection of its younger greatness. Allen as director and actor can not hide his love for the actress, as he could not by Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a medium-sized comedy to an appropriate place under Allen's canon, not much fun, sometimes brilliantly satirical: On the suspicious high-class assassin, Sid (Allen) jokes "I would be very surprised if he killed a person." This is vintage Allen humor. Although there are almost no brilliant literary allusions as in most of his film, he picks up Scoop with songs from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to let us know that Woodman has not lost his touch of class.
