Yes, a horror thriller tapped ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody This is demented and extravagant and part of the 1960s guignol cycle that leaked in the 1970s. Launched as a double feature with Burt Reynolds comedy, FUZZ, this crazy fright is so crazy that it's just too much fun. As a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, THE OUT and BABY JANE, I suggest that any prospective viewer assume the idea that this is almost an intention to be distorted and sit with someone with whom you can scream and smack in all. Actually get drunk while watching ..... in cheap champagne. Again, with many ideas for movies from the thirties, they are also about illusions; the struggle of time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder. But this is just crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA, the De Niro - Winters festival that makes this movie look positively glorious.
