This was undoubtedly the best of the series "Dirty Harry". Of the opening credits, you are engaged in a tale of revenge that hits hard and is deeply captivating. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a woman traumatized by revenge. Eastwood has many "sequestered" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but they show Harry with his best sound. Loaded with unforgettable characters in smaller roles, this movie balances and should serve as the standard for detective / action films. This is the only Dirty Harry movie that is raw and devoid of any "fluff". I can watch this again and again (ok, not at once) because it is a rewarding "revenge" wire. The pace is fast and several scenes are unforgettable. "Go ahead - Make my day ... Do you feel lucky, Punk? ..." Eastwood classic just like Eastwood, with his angular expressions and rubbery, and whispering and threatening voice can do it.
