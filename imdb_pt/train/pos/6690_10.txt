Mystery Men is one of those movies that gets more fun with time. There is naive innocence and "gentleness" for the characters. It has become part of our family "culture" and we quote the characters frequently. It's my favorite movie of the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and all three of us loved this movie. Great acting and comedy. We also love the Galaxy Quest and Monty Python. Okay, we're not talking about intellectual here, just the family connection!
