Of course this movie was not like that. 16 blocks, inside the man, an American haunting. But ... <br /> <br /> But it was a great mystery that could happen to any of us .. I found this movie really great and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed This movie "San Pedro, California" And we hear true stories based on incidents from this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you've ever heard of the famous boat in Long Beach "Queen Mary" Well that boat is haunted. I believe in spirts, illusions and parallel or however u spell it out. it's real. everyone is there within the universe itself. <br /> <br /> And the mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. It's great, and it's not a bad direction. <br /> <br /> For those who rate it as 1, they do not understand the movie. its meaning. his plot, his vision. and how bad oceanic life can be for each of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> Victor
