This is a superb movie, suitable for all but the youngest, although accessibility for young people has been spoiled (at least in print I saw) by using some unfortunate choice of English sub-titling! For most of the film it is almost impossible to guess at what period of time it is set - there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, only a monotonous, almost monotonous daily life against which the dazzling opera exposition contrasts of Sezuan and of celebratory fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure for a theater of war, this may still be at any time in the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see a car - late 30's, early 40's Style - and we realize we're watching a China on the brink of great confusion, and that much of the world we're seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War II and the communist revolution. <br /> <br /> What makes the central character's desire to adhere to the old customs and traditions even more moving. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises issues that are vitally important today, both in China and in other countries. parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade for various purposes in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm reading too much in this movie; but I do not think so! I also think it is a scandal that films of this caliber are often not shown in the UK while slag is passed as quality material. <br /> <br /> But do not tell me about it. .
