Incredible performance by Simon Pegg, who keeps getting better with each role. As usual, he plays the role of a very shrunken character that makes you want to hide behind your cushion in shame for him sometimes, but that's what Pegg is all about. Laughter was regular and watery eyes and they all pointed at Penn. The film was very skillfully set, where each character plays a very sophisticated and serious role, with Penn being the only humor involved, which is a huge credit to director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can not let that go without a quick shake of palms to Gilliam Anderson, who shone everywhere. Highly recommended to everyone.
