This is a documentary that I came across on the British television channel More4 and I must say that I found it extremely interesting and thought-provoking. I will also be looking for the book that was the source material for this documentary. Basically, this is Professor Jared Diamond's theory about why certain parts of Earth's societies thrived and others did not. The argument he presents was new to me and he argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals they are capable of taming are certainly attractive. As for the documentary itself, it is well filmed and well narrated, not much of the re-created scenes that spoil many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps, not to be condescending, which is a failure of many intellectuals when trying to carry a message to the masses. People have stated that their theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it and see it as a more sociable geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the evolution of non-religion based society. Preview highly recommended.
