All that a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) does not miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a note. Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. "I Love Me Very Easily", by Sinatra, is an indication of his best moment in season and in the future. Kelly's Mexican Hat Dance with a young Mexican girl is wonderful. Kelly certainly earned her nomination for Best Actor. And there's a bushel of really funny lines, like, "Do you think the Navy takes drugs?"; "Do you think someone sings a sailor to sleep?"; and, "We got into a little problem, we got a kid." A very nice film, just the thing to shake off the dust of a newly completed World War II.
