I watched a few years ago. I remembered this as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholy things, like Dorothy's fate and Bogdanovich's personal future. <br /> <br /> I turn to see my copy on VHS and then review it over and over. Nowadays I am waiting for the DVD version, at any price, please! <br /> <br /> The country and easy-listening music are very well chosen from the first second, a bit bluish but also happy. <br /> <br /> All the characters are great for me, with funny situations, great performances and many dialogues that have turned me into a cult movie for me and many people I met on the Internet or in movie clubs. This may not be low. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope about life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know this may be a particular commentary for the movie, but the fact is that I like it a lot, I think the movie struck me and I never I'll forget.
