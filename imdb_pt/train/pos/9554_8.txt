Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-energy comedies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood, since it does not have the values ​​of "social commentary" that many movies of the day (1969) needed to be. The characters are exaggerated satires of ordinary people and played for this purpose by all the actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines especially as Lord Foppington, a nobleman with hair too large to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the usual things of the eighteenth century; wrong identities, frustrated romances, corrupt government officials, and jokes at all times. <br /> <br /> Answer the questions: What happens when 4 turbulent, avid partisan sailors are on leave in a small British seaside town? And with whom do they get involved and how does it all end? <br /> <br /> Despite working poorly at the box office, it has great costumes, great music (based on the musical Mermaid Theater of the same name.), great acting, lively and sets that are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> That was never released on VHS or DVD is really a shame, since many bad movies are released every day.
