Zombie Chronicles is not something to be talked about, it's obviously not an award-winning movie, but it's a fun B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood, which was another fun low-budget movie. The acting is bad as cheaper movies but that is what makes it more fun, the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget, the blood is also great and disgusting, the movie is kind of a zombie version of Tales of the Crypt, since we have two tales about zombie encounters in the forest, the stories are fun and let you guess the first story especially. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you like low budget B-movies or cheap made zombie movies then go to Zombie Chronicles.
