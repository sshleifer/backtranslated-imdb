A little too long and surpassing the top, this comedy is an absolutely delightful look, never condescending or ridiculous, to the problems of a "power man" who likes to wear women's clothes at night. <br /> <Julie Walters is adorable as always, but Adrian Pasdar is totally credible and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk socks.
