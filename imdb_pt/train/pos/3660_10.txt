This obscure Sica delivers the goods. And it is said that "the meek shall inherit the earth." This tale of classes on the surface, but really an allegory for all the homeless who populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless, but cheerful, in very impoverished and selfish societies to care for them or to recognize them, rugs for the Italian freaks. Sica decides to count as a fairy tale, a story of Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not predict whether the deus ex machina is the writer or Vittorio's construction. It begins with the words "Once upon a time ..." to exemplify the timelessness of its history, for history could be defined anywhere and everywhere. Sketches of caricatures of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, the capricious nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to satisfy their desires and a direct end of a painting of Spielberg, make that boulevard a pleasure for all. The most accessible picture of De Sica is also one of his best. Abandoning the neo-realism, he always dallied between this and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills with the yearning for hope that we must continue leaving in this world. Thank you Vittorio! Thank you! Thank you !!! Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!
