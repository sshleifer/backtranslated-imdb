This was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to retouch our French before our planned vacation in beautiful Provence this year. So far, in addition to improving our French, we have considerably increased our appreciation of French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air to the shrill, predictable, unimaginable, and booming rancidity of Hollywood. What a good example for writers, actors, directors and filmmakers to follow. It was so exhilarating to also see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about this movie was the slow development of characters and plots that made you think about how it would all end. Is there any real good in this selfish bandit who continually treats his apparently naive benefactor with the kind of scorn an ex-convict would exhibit? Will our poor semi-deaf, sexually frustrated heroine be able to respond to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feelings for each other. <br /> <br /> Once you have seen this movie, like me, you may want to see it again. I have yet to discover the director's psychological motive for the sub-plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The plot calls for a little imagination when our hero has the chance to help our battered and overworked heroine in the office. You should also have an open mind to believe in your brilliant reading of the lips and how some of the actions fit. But if you move forward with the example of French cinema at its best, you will leave more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
