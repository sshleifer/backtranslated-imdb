"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the displays indicated it would be. It is not often that you think so. Most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with this. I was pleased with the original plot, although the subplots were not. The animation was not broken as "Shrek", but it was fine, however. The plot and story line were well presented and there were only a few slow points in them. This keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this. "Atlantis" receives and maintains your attention. You also have to think a bit, but not much. Once you think about it a little, you may find out what needs to happen, but you really do not know for sure how this will happen. <br /> <br /> The cast was also good. Michael J. Fox as Milo was an excellent choice. Your personality fits well. The harsh Commander Rourke was also well chosen by James Garner. His character reminded me of his "Maverick" performance, which I also liked. I really liked the cast of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. His ability to interpret a meaningless personality makes the film more interesting. It's a shame she's a villain. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's definitely worth it (8 out of 10).
