This is essentially a variation of House Of Wax, both in the plot and in the type of role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In the two photos he plays a talented artist who is overthrown by insanity when his creations are usurped by other less talented and less scrupulous people. In this film he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspire to start a performance career only to be frustrated when another illusionist, the Great Rinaldo (John Emery) insists. let him honor his contract and give him the first choice of any illusion he designs. The price is already ill-disposed towards Rinaldi, since his ex-wife is now a lover of Rinaldi. He employs his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant impersonator to get revenge on Rinaldi and others who frustrate his plans for recognition as an interpreter and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is pretty much the whole show here and it gives a well-judged star turns like an injustified man whose situation gains sympathy of the public. The rest of the cast is competent, if colorless and the weight of the whole enterprise falls on Price, who carries the burden easily. <br /> <br /> Melodrama solid B movie, this is a crime movie instead of a horror image and it is nice since you do not expect a work of art. Black and white spit is low in blood and is best seen as melodrama and appreciated by the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
