You're using IMDb. <br /> <br /> You have given some votes to some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And it's all because of that. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can not be given a ten? I wonder for those who give a seven or eight ... exactly how could THE BEST MANUFACTURED FILM be better? For the record, the long, still open shot is great charisma, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. And the dog on the bike is a nice touch. All this in fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often used too much. <br /> <br /> That's great.
