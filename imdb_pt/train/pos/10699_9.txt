When I saw Birthday Girl I liked it so much that I started seeing all the Nicole Kidman movies that I could, only to find all of them a disappointment compared to that. I theorize that although the presence of a particular star usually ensures a certain level of quality because of its artistic control with Nicole Kidman, the influence it exerts is detrimental to the enjoyment of cinema - IMHO. So, for example, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to lessen the existential insight she is hammering, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of the attention of anyone else, or other causes of Kidman's estimation. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and does an excellent job. I do not know how or who was able to contain it, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays its opening despite its resistance reaches the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And, consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable. Of course, the fact that the male protagonist turns from a millionaire employee into a macho man in the space of a movie seems like a fantasy of male ego expansion, but his transformation is adequately convincing. It is not timidly planned as it would be in a movie designed to strengthen the male ego. Instead, it accurately records the growth required by the unique circumstances of the films. <br /> <br /> It is also charming how criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, in addition to their criminal mission. His gang has a rough and rough communion that is foreign to American culture. And while they are your opponents, they are never really your enemies. In fact, they teach you to compete. <br /> <br /> I really marveled at Kidman's ability to look physically Russian. I wondered if her ancestry was Russian, but none of the pictures I looked at showed any hint of it. Maybe it's just makeup, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope they get it again soon so she can make another great movie. Despite my free discoveries in Ms. Kidman, the message is that this is a superior movie in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.
