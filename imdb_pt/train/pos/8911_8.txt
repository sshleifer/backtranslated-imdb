I've seen The Blob several times and it's one of the best low-budget alien invasion movies of the 1950s. A strange meteor lands outside a small town and an elderly man is going to investigate this. . A strange gelatinous substance binds to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the land of the meteor arrive in time and take it to the local doctor, where the old man is then completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe in the young couple and accuse them of inventing it all. They finally believe in them when the mass, now huge, appears in the city cinema and everyone runs to the streets screaming. Then he connects to a dinner with the young couple and a few others inside. The Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers and freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported by plane to the frozen Arctic waste and disposed of there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a typical setting for your period: teenagers and a small town. Blob has good rock 'n' roll theme music in the beginning and the movie is all atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The sequel, Watch out! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988, but this is the best of The Blob movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him a star. and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is a must see for all science fiction fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
