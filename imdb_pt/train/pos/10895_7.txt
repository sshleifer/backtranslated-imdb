Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as an unpleasant millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family at Christmas. He then drives the family crazy with too much praise for Christmas. I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (though I've enjoyed Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well-scaled for that role. I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter of the family who does not support Affleck's character in the beginning. Of course you can see where this movie is going but you do not care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie because it's funnier than many Christmas movies.
