Some of Altman's known "masterpieces" seem sadder to me now. Maybe it's me. As the last reviewer, I even like this "smaller" Altman (shown recently in FMC), although I do not think he was targeting a broad audience. Political organization as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of this satirical "docudrama" is now dated, like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show, but I found much of the dialogue funny and insightful (eg "You're real. That means you're not a threat to anyone"). The story is not "deep" but I enjoyed it. And the performances are funny, especially Cavett (as "himself"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of Parliament) as a leftist ideologue (in the opening scene talking to someone dressed carrot over the sanctity of politics) and Carol Burnett as a basket case. All in the inimitable Altman style, though perhaps not as inimitable as usual. But very inimitable.
