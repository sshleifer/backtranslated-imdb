This is a deliriously vulgar and vulgar version of all the first stars that Warner Bros could afford. ... and like most other rarely seen films made during the late 1920s, an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the exuberance and genuine youth of the 1920s in music and dance. The SHOW OF SHOWS is very gigantic. Vaudeville act after soliloquy after tapping after acrobat after comedian after fan-dance after ukulele madness after Rin Tin Tin introducing "an oriental number" ... (!) ... and so on he approaches, smiling and squealing fabulous gramophone-quality vinylphone sound. It's very long, but among the delirious delights is the incredible number "Singin in the Bathtub" created on a scale of which the architects of QE2 would be proud ... Beatrice Lillie relaxing next to a grand piano with some happiness boys amiably Nick Slitty, and the grand finale in two colors ... that's all set for the song LADY LUCK. . The tubby chorus line and the jumping teenagers are so interested in telling us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly on their own faces with joy and effort. Row after row of "doll" characters pass over and some even emerge from the ground. I'm not joking, there are even girls tied to crystal chandeliers, mummified with shiny gauze and chained with strings of pearls, unable to move (for days, I imagine, during production) while this katzenjammer of toy box- up and spasm below for the Ukulele Orchestra. Of course I loved it and had to watch this color final over and over and invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrorize each of them separately and roll in the hall in shouts of joy to each and every exclamation of their frightened reactions. And you should too ... and rejoice that there was a time when it was created simply to entertain and thrill. It's all so insane.
