For those who think this program is not for them, try it. Network television has degenerated into programs that are clones of clones or are reality-based shows that show some people often unrealistic. This show is a return to family-oriented TV where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning about what real friends and family are, and maybe even learning a little bit about our national hobby. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most engaging young show business actors nowadays, and he is perfectly cast as the young and lightly naive new drummer of the fictional New York Empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the lead cast, and they are all outstanding. This show deserves a chance to catch and be seen. I hope it continues for a few seasons and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learn and grow.
