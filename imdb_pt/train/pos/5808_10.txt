Moonwalker is a great movie, from beginning to end, you can not take your eyes off it. I love all the Michael clips singing and dancing and I just love the little 'studio tour' ... soo funny :) And the 'mini movie' is cool, with all the special effects, etc ... Michael is a genius and always will be !!!
