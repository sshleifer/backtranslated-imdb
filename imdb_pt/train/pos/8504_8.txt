You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a secret US soldier, tough soldier who is sent to discover the Nazi secret and turn the tide of World War II. That means everything from getting out of a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is possibly the most influential game of its time. That's because it literally inspired the obsession. Many games existed at the time and still more today, but every once in a while you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before him and most recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is best in almost every aspect but the ears heard around the world that led to one of the biggest waves of the game were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman, and legions of others owe their existence to the ID guys. Be it directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do. <br /> <br /> Even with its old look, very old graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, the games now border on the "experience" level) and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all the six episodes provide a lot of fun, especially discovering these secrets with treasures and a chaingun in them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Stop!" * bang! bang! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never gets old. - 8/10 <br /> <br /> Voluntarily rated PC-13 for "deep carnage." However, it is exceptionally tame when compared to current games.
