I took some of this show on public television and knew I had to have it. The boys give everyone at the Royal Albert an excellent performance, often exciting, in every way. Pure, too - no synthesizer, no lasers and strobes covered by smoke, no grand entrance (and a dismembered audience, serious and appreciative, all leaving their bottle rockets at home). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Cream (or if you just heard of them); if you are a fan of blues; if you are a rock 'n' roll fan; you will not be disappointed when you come and listen to this DVD. You also will never lose this DVD because you will never lend to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get yours!) It's too good and too repetitive; you will want to keep it within easy reach.
