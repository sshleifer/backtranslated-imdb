about a year and a half ago my father told me about The French Doors. I thought it sounded interesting enough, but I did not try to find it anywhere. So about a year ago, I remembered the movie and thought "hey why not" and tried to find it on the internet. Eventually after about a week looking I found in atom films. I called my dad to the computer and said to him, "Hey dad, I found that scary movie you told me about centuries ago!" He smiled at me, turned around and turned off the lights, so that it was completely dark, away from the computer screen, and told me to watch it. I started well ... So when he started to get worried about what was there, I found it very annoying. in the end I pushed the chair back and got up ... she made me jump !: P If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it, because it's worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time, is still disturbing. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE!
