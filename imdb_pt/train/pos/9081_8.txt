If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> The Special Effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the plot and effects compensated accordingly. <br /> <br /> I wish I had seen this in the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch screen TV screen. <br /> <br /> If you like uninterrupted action, awesome visual effects and a taste for myth and wisdom ... you have to see this movie !!
