Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know the pace of it. <br /> <br /> Also if you have not seen most of the movies or at least some other movies by the same directors mentioned in this document, you will be a bit lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of movies is long. Directed by Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild in the Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola) of segway like, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but the ones that I suspect are baits. To be sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or if you care) with psychoanalytic analysis, you will be bored endlessly. <br /> <br /> But you should not be, like the scenery, clips, the way the movie intersperses with these clips, Zizek points are never boring.
