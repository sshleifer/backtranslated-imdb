Well, I'm going to go against the tide in this movie so it seems. Being a fan of confessed terror I sat down to this not knowing well what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I really found myself scared (very rare). The film obviously has a small budget and is set around the cross charing season, but the lack of money from the movies does not distract the story. Yes, the story is a little improbable and is not well explained, but THE CREEP is a class act and proceeds to cut and dismantle anything that comes your way. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE THAT YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR EYES OR AT LEAST CROSS YOUR LEGS !! You will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie and make a move to see a good horror movie that really scares
