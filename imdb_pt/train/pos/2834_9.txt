I have not seen much German comedy, but if this movie is something to go by, I am bound to see more! The simple yet effective plot takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, a mother of two unemployed, discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything else, but what turns out is a very funny series of events with perfect completion. My interest in international film has expanded since the first time I saw this movie. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of small children fool you into thinking it's a family movie) who love comedy - even those who are unfamiliar with the language.
