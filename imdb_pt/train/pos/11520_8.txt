The road movie par excellence ... if your idea of ​​a road movie involves three supposed magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani. (Well, one in four is not bad ...) An untalented mage with an eye for charisma (Max) watches a very skilful pickpocket (Hugo) working in New York. After convincing Hugo that he (Max) is a) mental and b) desperately needs a partner to fulfill his dreams of being a stage magician, the not so dynamic pair invokes the managerial experience of an inventor of illusions (Milo) and the kindest attributes of a lovely waitress (Lydia). The unlikely four pack up in a van (obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it came from) and go to Vegas. Havoc follows. Anyway, it's funny, it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart and, better yet, totally unexpected.
