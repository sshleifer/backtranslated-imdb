A young woman who is a successful model, and is also engaged and has attempted suicide twice in the past, is chosen by a secret and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "sentry" of the gateway to Hell. , which apparently passes through a scary but well maintained old Brooklyn building. Their tenants have climbed the ladder and can reincarnate, but apparently they can not escape while a sentry is there to block the way. The former (John Carradine) is about dead, so she, by fate or whatever, becomes the next, and the damned must get her to kill herself so they are free. Many interesting details are beneath the surface, her relationship with her father, the stories of the damned, her fianc√©, so you can go through it as a horror of cheap exploration, but given the sets, the great cast and the general level of bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing.
