Even though I'm very young, the Beatles are my band ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE! I never got a chance to listen to their music like it was releases, but I loved them as long as I can remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie worth trying once. I can see why it was not released at the movies, but it certainly is a great movie to put on TV. I was flipping through my TV guide and happened to see this movie, did not give much detail, except something like 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the Beatles ended, Jared Harris Stars'. I had never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn, who played Paul. However, they certainly are underrated actors! <br /> <br /> The film had a slow start, but as it developed, I could see how Quinn, but especially Harris, played his characters. As a big fan, I kind of know how true Lennon and McCartney are. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms! Quinn played McCartney very well, but sometimes it went into his Irish accent. The makeup artists made them look great. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE STATED AS SPOILER: As I mentioned earlier, it started slowly but soon developed into a rather emotional film. I found the piece in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both musicians. As for Lennon's rude line at the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eyes whenever I watch. <br /> <br /> It's quite different from the other biographical films I've seen about how the Beatles got together and became famous, and those who never really made the characters so well. For example. 'Backbeat'. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that if you are a fan of The Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give it a chance that you can have a pleasant surprise. With just 95 minutes in length, it's worth waiting for the movie to unfold. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really happened, please send it to the 'comments page' of this movie, I would be very interested.
