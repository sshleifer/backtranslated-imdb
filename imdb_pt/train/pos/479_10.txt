Natalia by Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic main character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond any doubt. Or is it transmuted to the king? The intestinal weaving of chess sets and the families' struggles for control, power and victory are impressive. Like the chess masters in the film, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at the same time, but all are intertwined in larger or smaller patterns. The period, costumes and images of the Lake District of Italy in the early 20th century are magnificently captured. Not a single square of space is wasted. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes are abundant, I can not recount them all. I recommend reserving enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart because you can not capture all the poetry inside a multidimensional structure of 64 squares in one setting. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try my analogy, what I'm reading reminds me of another triumphant poetry film like The Natural by Barry Levinson. He totally dismissed the pessimistic end of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was exclusively American. Well, the director did his best to perfectly blend the morals and Russian and Italian customs as background for enlightenment. The real story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both participants tie in. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by these restrictions and conventions of life, insofar as we let others break our spirits. <br /> <br /> Pure love, personified by Emily Watson's Natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by her gifts simultaneously. Only the barriers erected by our fears can get us out of this. <br /> <br /> This is a magnificent movie (10/10).
