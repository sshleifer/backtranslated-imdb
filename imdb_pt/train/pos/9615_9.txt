This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where Chaos Theory is summed up by telling us about the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about it (or at least something, do not worry, this is not spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and do not believe in pre-intended things, fate, etc., but this movie certainly does. to know if the coincidence really exists ... Moreover, the performance and the camera are excellent too, another proof that it is still possible to make a good movie without a zillion dollars
