Scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All the scientific and innovative pseudo-sciences of the 1930s are there, including the idea that radioactivity could cure any disease if properly utilized. When he summons his rivals - who expelled him from the scientific community and ridiculed him - to testify to his discovery, they propose a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course they end up stealing too much dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. In addition, an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting actor from the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. The young wife of Rukh (Drake) trophy, who falls madly in love with that piece of human being. Having grown horns like a deer would not do dr. Rukh (Karloff) is more friendly, so he embarks on a secret revenge mission ... killing two of his enemies and a dr. Benet (Lugosi), the one who helped him ... finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that allowed him to embark on his revenge to begin with, but (to my utmost dissatisfaction) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she married. Acting is very good, with Karloff and Lugosi being very good. Check the hysterical scene of the maid ... Other characters are not worth being mentioned ... Recommended, as well as ALL the horrors of the Old Universal ...
