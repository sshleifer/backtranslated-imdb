Have you read Jim Thompson? He is hard noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. Rarely are private detectives at work - only losers, psychotics, and small crooks. This movie has Thompson preached - "If God made real mistakes in this world, it made us want to live when we have no excuse for that." Each character in the film balances on the razor's edge between surreal and scary realism. Conn. Uncle Bud, conniving, played by Bruce Dern and eccentric and well-meaning Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance like Kid Collins, an ex-fighter nothing shiny and shy who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale that we can not understand ... It's not your standard noir movie, nor is it meant to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two excellent novel adaptations of one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
