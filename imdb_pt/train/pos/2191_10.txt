Shakespeare said we are actors placed on a big stage. But when this stage is Israel, the work we interpret multiplies by ten and all the actions we do are filled with a difficult style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrayal of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but in addition, Katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the Israeli people and, this people, far from being simple prominent figures, speaks to us of the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the dark informational point of view in which it lives, and this marvelous country comes to light like a splendid bird that rises from its ashes. It is very good for me because the reality of the State of Israel, which Europeans only know for the news diaries or the newspapers, appears as a near and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people who seek their place, exploring the everything. State, the whole culture with the sole purpose of feeling part of it. Katzir builds an absolutely wonderful documentary and demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thanks Dan for opening his eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
