The RKO had a reputation for making American folk and home pieces. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in movies since she was a child. In 1933 she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "flower girl" in "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr I remembered Anne's work from an earlier film and that's how she got that role. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a stuck boat, the "stolen" brooch, the "red hair" incident. Anne was so right for the role of the emotive and chattering orphan. She was heartbroken in her intensity, her eagerness to please, and her ardent temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as the understanding of Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was just as good as the Marilla company. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also participated in films as a child, was just as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved that she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in Andy Hardy's series, it was Mrs. Barry.
