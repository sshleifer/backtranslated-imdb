MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of the great US military figures and a figure familiar to me from the very beginning of my memory. Although there is a continuity problem (there may be others), and. MacArthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 speech at the US Military Academy on acceptance of the Thayer Award did not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die; they just disappear." (That was in his speech to Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not turn a blind eye!) Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as the general who promised that he would return to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with General, his family and his team from the beginning of World War II to the end of his service career. This film would be of far greater importance to someone familiar with both World War II and the Korean War. However, Peck's portrait of this great man who fought against the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can indeed be a memorable one. "In war there is no substitute for victory."
