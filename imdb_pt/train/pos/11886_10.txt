I loved this movie First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, it provides a refreshing insight into how to deal with HIV news in a family, with much less hysteria than I normally have seen in the movies. The brothers are very close, but they are not critical. His desire to protect his younger brother is noble, but it is not necessary in the end. I understand that Leo's choice in how to handle his treatment may not have been the most popular among people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can not believe this was a French television show. He had great production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think you will too, after you have seen it.
