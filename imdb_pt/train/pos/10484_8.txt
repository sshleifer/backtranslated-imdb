Enchantment does not even begin to describe "saving grace"; is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who ventures into this movie will come out with their spirits flying high (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her troubles are about to get much worse. His dear departed left him with no money and outstanding debts. Faced with losing everything, she has to figure out a way to make lots of money ... fast! She has an idea when her gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks the famous horticulturist to advise him on a plant he is secretly growing. Grace immediately realizes that their plan is marijuana, so they decide to use their gardening skills to grow many high-quality weeds, and then sell them to pay their outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable quality about "Saving Grace" is your sympathy. Each character is extremely understanding and, with the exception of the first 20 minutes, the film is a good uninterrupted sound. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means turning a blind eye to some illegal activity. <br /> <br /> The acting is of a high level. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best actresses in Britain, and here's why. She turns what could have been a caricature into a totally alive and breathing individual. She is a good girl, but she is not an idiot. Craig Ferguson is also kind as Matthew. He is a loser loser, but he is so nice that it does not matter. The rest of the cast falls into this category too, but special mention has to go to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has a threatening aura about him, and that goes well with him, but he also has great comedy skills. <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Saving Grace". It's all about the charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be drained from the film. Not so here. The film is completely enjoyable and always fun. This is not to say that "Saving Grace" is just a nice movie that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. While this movie is not a comedy, it has two or three scenes that are not at all hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with the film, it is that the climax is a bit confusing. The questions are answered, and the ending brings an unexpected turnaround. <br /> <br /> See "Saving Grace," especially when you are having a bad day.
