Knocked out of the real-life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in New York in 1890, "The Bowery" is high-energy and good-natured. <br /> <br /> But be warned: Casual racial epithets flow from the languages ​​of Wallace Beery. and little Jackie Cooper. The first shot can be surprising. This is true for the time that was set and the time it was set. And also speaks to the diversity of the population in that neck of the forest. This certainly adds to the flavor of the atmosphere. <br /> Beery as Connors is thunder in the center of the action, a noisy guardian with his own fire brigade. And he has a weak by the orphan Cooper. Raft like Brodie is Connors' finest and best rival in almost every endeavor. Brodie could never refuse a challenge and loved attention, leading to a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (it's still debated whether he actually jumped or used a doll). <br /> <br /> Beery is as bombastic as ever with an Irish-American accent. He is just the rude type of character to attract kids, cats and women in danger. This is possibly the loudest character Raft has ever played, and he even starts dancing a bit (as well as a leg show). And again he confuses the protagonist (adorable Fay Wray) with a prostitute. Cooper is as tough as any of them, but he has a chance to turn the tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not the bridge jump, but a close fight between Connors and Brodie. which in close-up looks like a real fight between the directors. It's true that someone hurt more than an ego.
