We begin all our comments with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 movies a year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored to receive lifetime movie passes for any movie at any time, at no cost! Then we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count toward ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not really different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the movie and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. So it's our belief that if you get your money's worth for two hours of fun, it's good enough for us! We NEVER NEVER hear or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Well enough about that. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not just good, but very good. Critics are a bunch of idiots. Just because there is nudity and language, they hated it. It was worth the ticket price and that is all you can ask for. This is not right? Every movie can not be nominated for an Oscar. Sharon Stone is beautiful and does a great job on the film and puzzles me about what the heck the critics want
