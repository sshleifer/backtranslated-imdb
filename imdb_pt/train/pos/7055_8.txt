Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel, I love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice that wrote a book for Cinderella was inspired. I like to write stories and I hope children are encouraged by it. The three stories are cute and fun, although the songs were forgettable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked to see Lucifer, Bruno, the Rat Choir and all the rest. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the housekeeper. A sequence made for a change. My rating 8/10.
