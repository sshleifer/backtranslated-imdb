The film is a real demonstration of how the higher society has become emotional and selfish. There are many characters and each character is representing a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral, unlike the heroes of all typical Indian films and no character is 100% bad, but all are just different. The film is a perfect blend of thrills, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that raised some social issues. I would recommend it to everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers the Bollywood parties for the newspaper, but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But that's not all, so it shows how she could not survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she gets fired from work. So she could not find a job as a crime reporter and has to do it again. Not only she but a very large number of characters are intertwined in the film and everyone gives a different feeling while watching the movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a good movie. Please, do not get lost.
