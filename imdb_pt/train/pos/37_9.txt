Of the elements that make this the best at the moment, I have to say # 1 is Christine McIntire. The scene of Shemp when poisoned and his reaction is really magnificent. I imagine that, as a poster suggested, Christine was trying to restrain laughter during that scene, but in fact made her look even more delightfully evil, to be smiling at the possibility of Shemp dying. <br /> <br /> Another character who helps stand out is the Goon. His gaze was a great cross between the horrible and comical prank. Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or, anywhere. I would have preferred some whodunit true mystery in this, but, hey, when a short is so good, who will complain. Not me
