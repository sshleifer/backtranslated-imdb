This nice little noir features a superior cast and many memorable scenes. The great distraction is complete disrespect for authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And on top of that, Bacall should be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and speak in very different accents, is a real joke! And I think, seeing as they were alone, that they should be speaking Spanish anyway! It seems very strange that the Warner brothers could not find any Spanish-speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course Hollywood has always had a policy of "any old accent" - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have bought Novarro as "Confidential Agent" - he would have been great in the role of Boyer or at least in Francen (which would have saved him a lot of money in the makeup budget).
