A good movie and one that I will watch several times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there's a lot more going on here than is clear on the title plates, and I have to imagine how much he suffered in the translation. Was there more in the original? Or a native audience expected to read more? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was based - was this a popular story that the audience was already very familiar with? In short, it's worth taking a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it. <br /> <br /> The release of Alpha Video announces the new organ soundtrack, but the music is not matched to the progression of the story in any way. Of course, it starts promisingly, but degenerates into a repetitive monotony, similar to Phillip-Glass, which reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned the sound off and simply watched: much better!
