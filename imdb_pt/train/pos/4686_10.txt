This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because she is not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as beating and female submission) that other popular films are too shy to play. Nothing seems to be off limits in this movie as the director freely develops the story without any concern given the possibility of offending the viewer. However, I do not think anything was done here just for shock value or offending someone on purpose. Sean Young does a great and brave performance. Most accomplished actresses would not have taken on this role or would have requested major changes in the script before accepting it. The other cast members do a good job too. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that this film did not appear in telegram since a brief mandatory publication one year after arriving in theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it simply does not fit into today's political atmosphere. It seems rather ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (which is getting closer and closer to hardcore porn), but will not carry a mainstream movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, even if this movie is only 11 years old, it probably would not be done today. <br /> <br />
