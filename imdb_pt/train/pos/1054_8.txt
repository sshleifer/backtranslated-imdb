If you want senseless action, hot girls and a post-apocalyptic Seattle view, then this is the show for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of Dark Angel is nothing new (there are actually controversies about whether James Cameron stole the idea of ​​a book), but I spend the entire hour watching every Tuesday from start to finish . Jessica Alba is smoking and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max need to be a bit better (the slang sounds forced and it looks like someone living in the suburbs wrote). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure, filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if you're looking for an award-winning drama, go watch "The West Wing" or something.
