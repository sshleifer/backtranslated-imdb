This movie is one of my all time favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. casting. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy, all in one. The scene of the final battle to this day gives me shivers and the ending always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.
