"Journey of Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope descending to despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning film is well-crafted, it is devoid of substance and has many implausibilities. Most of the film's runtime of 1.7 hours is on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, get off the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, etc .; time that could have been better spent or left out altogether. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the common crime of smuggling of illegal immigrants. A watch that is worth and reasonably fun, but over-rated.
