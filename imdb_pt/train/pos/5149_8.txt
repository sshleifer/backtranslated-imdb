This is a tepid docu-drama that does not cover new paths, rework all cliches and is sloppy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. However, it is heralded as a surrender. For example, European news providers did not shout (and do not make) headlines while selling their papers. However, this strictly American custom is employed in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they seized power, but there it is in the pulpit while Hitler delivers one of its rod-reelers. In fact, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitler's oratory. The film also perpetuates the myth that the brewery putsch was devised at the Hoffbrauhaus in Munich. Was not. Robert Carlyle makes a good picture of his subject. But your support cast is appropriate at best and often not even that. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can only hope that the second is better, but do not bet on it.
