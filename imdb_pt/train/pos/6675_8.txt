The direction behind this movie was fantastic for a comedy. Many of the scenes seem to be out of a comic book and much darker (visually - not a wise story) than I expected. It's true that this may not be the funniest movie of all time, especially if you like macho and crude jokes, as this has very little (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). As you watch again, several jokes stand out and become funnier. If you've read a comic book or watched a comic book (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked them, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the film. If you did not like them, you might like the respectful ridicule this movie has for them. If you liked this movie, the dvd has some nice extras. (8/10)
