I rented this movie last weekend, turned on the surround sound system and got great sound effects. This movie is a great location for movies, the special one affects where enough to scare my fianc√©, but I noticed that some looked surprisingly computer generated. I did not go to the movies and I saw this, but it's a scary night and I do not feel like leaving the movies. I recommend it!
