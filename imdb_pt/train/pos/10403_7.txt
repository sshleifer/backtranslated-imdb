This is an oriental fantasy about the "Arabian Arabian Nights" of many incredible adventures, witchcraft of fantasy and magic. The evil vizier Jaffar (magnificently interpreted by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magical faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad (attractive John Justin) that loses its throne, then escapes thanks to a small robber called Abu (nice Sabu). They arrive in Basra, where Ahamad and the princess (beautiful June Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and the thief are haunted by Jaffar, Ahamd is blind and Abu becomes a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients, such as the transformation of the star, a flying mechanical horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genius (overacting by Rex Ingram) that gives three wishes to Sabu, the magical eye, the figure of Kali goddess with several hands, among others. <br /> <br /> This remarkable image ranks as one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda of London Fim and directed by Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, with an impressive screenplay of Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, he also dialogues with writer and actor as Sultan, a lover of mechanical games. The outbreak of World War II caused the paralyzing gunfire, so the three Korda brothers and co-workers traveled through the US continuing to film in particular in Grand Cannon Colorado. The splendid visuals and glimpses of Technicolor, stage and FX cinematography have led to the triumph of three Oscars: Production Design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, George Perinal's Cinematography and Osmond Borradaile's Special Effects are dated and a necessary remastering is urgently needed because colors are worn. In addition, an appointment for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with loads of imagination will appeal to fantasy fans and classic movie fans.
