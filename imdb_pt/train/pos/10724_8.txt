This is one of those that feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It's up there with other retro movies like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to brighten things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> Personally I really like movies like that from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a good plot. And I would never have met Mr. Phoenix, I did not read the credits recently. He was just a baby really when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was also the young novice actress as well. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree it's not an Oscar-caliber movie. But it is worth watching. Especially if you have children in the range of 8 to 11 years. Or those who are interested in the space program.
