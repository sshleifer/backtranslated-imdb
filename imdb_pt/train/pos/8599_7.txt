It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas picks up the persona GG and turns her into a Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. The detailed work on showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was also intriguing. All the contacts were very good, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent. While Jodie Foster just made you suspend the belief and really think she was FBI Starling's agent in "Silence of the Lambs," you do not have the same feeling with Longoria. However, this is a fun, entertaining escapist movie with the Beltway as the backdrop.
