Do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that might contain any spoilers). Just watch this amazing movie without knowing anything about it - and you will have a great experience. If you like to see a clever and twisted story: go, get the DVD and you really will not be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a science fiction film, but a psychological thriller set in the globalized business environment. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies look at the research departments and the methods used by them. The actors perform well and the overall visual style of the film provides a perfect mood of coolness. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - which belongs to the story and the end - also much, much more satisfying than the other Vincenzo Natali films, "Cube" and "Nothing." In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I do not really say about every fifth movie well done). Sorry, I can not say anything more about this movie without risking hurting your experience. Just give it a try. ;-)
