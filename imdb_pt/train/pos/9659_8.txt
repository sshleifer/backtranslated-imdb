'Presque Rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Avoiding stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderfully naturalistic, superbly represented film, inspired by the coastal city where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If anything is almost too realistic, just like in the way of the conventional plot, only scenes of a lifetime. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts less than it could in a world so subtly designed. 'Presque Rien' may not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism serves well in comparison to the preconceived celebratory or prejudiced viewpoints that often spoil the treatments of that theme. Worth a watch.
