This is one of the movies that gets better every time you see them. It is full of original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in the subsequent films of Sabu (I have not seen "Unlucky Monkey" yet, but the others are so great), failure, chance, and humanism play an important role. The cut and erection is inventive and artistic without the film being an "art" image, but a very entertaining film. When comparing it to "Run, Lola, Run" you should keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was made a few years earlier and was shown on German TV in 1997 ... so it is more likely that it served as inspiration for The Movie of Tom Tykwer, and not the other way around. Complementing the other comments, I have to add that I really like the performance and the end. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it manages to convey a message without being boring or pretentious.
