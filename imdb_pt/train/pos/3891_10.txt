One of the greatest comedians of all time. I've seen this show about 10 times and probably watched it at least another 100. My friends and family cite this DVD so many times that you think we did nothing but watch it. The initial part about Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either cross over or go straight to the part where Eddie is on the stage. Pay attention to the "Cake or Death" part (Play on the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" part (Hard to explain, just watch). The best part of the show may be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and shadow probably help, huh?) Warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw many four-letter words.
