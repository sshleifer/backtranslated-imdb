When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, this is how I think this movie should be judged in terms of See the rich golden tones that surround the young sleeping concubine by the fireplace, or the stifling Turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with impressions of spices, coarse cloths, smooth skin, perfumed oils, flickering flames, satin rustling. Do not just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the storyteller's monotonous voice mesmerize you.
