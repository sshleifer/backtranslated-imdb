When I watched this movie for the first time, it was a recorded copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still own the tape and I confess I've watched it more than once from start to finish! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally entertaining! I got some of my friends to watch this and we had some great laughs from the awful script. The movie concerns a couple, (remember this is like in the early 70's so they are very hip hop!) Who go on a weekend trip in what I believe should be in northern NY . They have a hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl regrets the fish's death and they ate it! The guy comes back with some nonsense about how they ate the fish and now he was a part of them, and he goes; "And that's a pretty face!" Heavy man, very heavy! I LAUGHED A LOT! Anyway, come a couple of Vietnam veterans, one of those who plays flute, I believe. (Anyway, they're music mates!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple turns hostile, they end up terrorizing them at night. The guy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girlfriend being snatched up by both guys. In fact, by the end of the night, she looks pretty, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and the guy are free to leave. Supposedly the guy learned a lesson on how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh! Never fails to amuse me anyway! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I would actually buy it again, it's a classic camp! You have to love these things!
