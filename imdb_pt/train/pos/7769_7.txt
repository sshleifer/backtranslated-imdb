Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humphrey Bogarts disease and death when she made this movie. Rock Hudson was near the top of her 1950s stardom. Dorothy Malone is in great shape and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and falls just short for his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit of soap from another time, but as worthwhile as most dramas. Amazing how drunks can drive in this movie and also how quickly Stack over in some of the early movie hits. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is so good and actually production, this movie is very good. You can say that Bacall is distracted during this movie, while her acting is good, she seems emotionally exhausted in some sequences. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this film are so light that many of today's young viewers do not realize what they are. Film does a good job telling a story and actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end, but none was made, although Written Beyond the Wind was a good title.
