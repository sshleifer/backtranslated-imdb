Return To The 3rd Chamber is the comic continuation of the epic 36th Chamber of Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became an incredible monk and fighter. In this sequence, Liu plays an unfortunate loser who has to learn kung fu after getting his friends beaten. He imitates the original Shan Te, tries all sorts of tricks to enter the Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bosses of bullying. It is a classic tale of light martial arts, with the production values ​​of the Shaw brothers and the safe direction of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic everywhere, whether for comedy or comedy or for the performance of Gordon Liu, as well as the others, particularly the sympathetic monk who works perfectly with the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some of the stars, other works and certainly there are bigger, more violent and sweeping films from Shaw Brothers. But few have such a magical blend of clowning, unique training and fighting, with a subtle but warmed tale of a useless guy doing good. Full of light-hearted joy, it is impossible not to give the highest score.
