What happens to the rock-n-roll stars in the late 90's? They launch a return / reunion tour. At least, that's what the members of Strange Fruit, a 70's stadium rock group do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has the concession in vending machines for condoms when he comes across the promoter's son. of a famous music festival. It was in this festival in the 70's that Strange Fruit broke. The 70's are "retro" and it's the right time to amplify this wave. He leaves in search of the other members of the band. <br /> <br /> Part of what ended the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the vocalist and brilliant composer. The band was known for their excessive lifestyle and now they are back among the working class they came from. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layabout, the bassist is a carpenter, and his vocalist is still a rocker. While he owns a huge mansion, he was forced to sell it, since his fortune did not last. Brian, the guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, the band agrees to give the meeting a chance. Abandoning their day jobs, they begin rehearsing, and their manager approaches his record label about reissuing their albums. But he wants them to start touring again first. And so they came to the club circuit across Europe. The club scene is not sweet with these overweight, old and dated rockers. <br /> <br /> It's on tour that the movie really starts to develop. All the old conflicts rearrange themselves, with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering everywhere. Everyone is together because they are in search of a second chance for the greatness that deceived them before. And they rediscover part of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy begins as Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film, following the relationships of the band members. Although it's still a very funny movie, it's the evolving characters, struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and their own personal demons that make the movie work.
