I had seen this movie when it was released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember vividly the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escape every time they come across danger :) And the best feature of the film was the picture of the villain! I think many of the so-called action movies have copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not only that never strikes me when I see this copy, as it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The leading actors acted wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of chemistry between hero and heroin was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we thought that the love that developed them was very natural. The way they face and overcome all the trials and tribulations together was something that can make even the children realize the value of true love, sacrifice and affection. I recommend that every person see this movie when they have a chance !! - Vijay.
