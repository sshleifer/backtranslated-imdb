Misfits in a military school? Hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the sex crazy teenager, the smart mouth, the marijuana smoker, and do not forget, the guy who burns things. Play a strict and meaningless Sergent, a homosexual Sergent and a sexy ammo teacher and this makes for a crazy movie adventure. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie and it's funny because comedy revolves around the fact that if you try to work together, things are done. <br /> <br /> These gangs of misfits from the Weinberg Military School were put here because, as Sgt Liceman says, "you are excluded, constraints on your families and communities, disgrace." One of Ralph Macchio's previous performances before the Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with appearances by Barbara Bach as well, this film attracts teenagers and young adults. <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack keeps the movie moving.
