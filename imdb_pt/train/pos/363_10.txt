This movie is about development. Growing people and disappearing people, amazing people and disappointing people. It has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It truly is a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the entire cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in his debut role. <br /> <br /> This film made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory every Saturday in every prison in the world - it affects your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I'll admit: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
