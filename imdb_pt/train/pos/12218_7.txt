Japan is in serious trouble. Demons infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to his unholy will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the queen of the demons, is near. The only thing that stands in the way of this grave threat are the Demon Guardians, a fearsome group of warriors, who can be as bad as the demons themselves. Izumo is a Defated Warden, who five years ago took the theater instead of killing demons after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a battle that strangely resembles the scene from Dusk's bar to Dawn) . One night, on a chance meeting, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes intertwine (literally) and they are doomed by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / sword epic, you'd be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical of Ashura. It's a miscellany of many different genres of movies. The ones we just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) manipulates the genre with a lot of respect (although comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but very entertaining popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> To be sure, there are flaws in the movie. Part of the humor seems artificial and out of place. And acting is not the best. But seriously, do you watch Fantasia / Swordplay / Comedy movies for great performances? No, we watched them for action and the crazy CG visuals, which Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all action but it is generously generalized with lots of fencing and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; the film has its flaws and is not a martial arts epic, but it does not try to be and has interesting visuals and good fencing action. The reason the movie worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, they will surely be delighted with this fun and silly fantasy sword action movie. My Rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
