YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. Yes, the performance varies from medium to laughable. Yes, it has been done so many times before. However, we are dealing with a movie that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. There are in fact some original death scenes and tension increases throughout the film. Plus, you're never more than a few minutes away from a bloody kill. I ask you all to watch this film with a look without prejudice and see what you intended to be; a scary and funny horror movie with an unparalleled theme song.
