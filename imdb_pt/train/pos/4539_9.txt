The acting is pretty cheesy, but for the people in that area in the 1980s and now they're Detroit automotive engineers, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, which makes this movie even funnier. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno was showing off his age last night at The Tonight Show! He looks very young here ... 17 years. The opening scene with the drag racing on what looks like Woodward Ave was great. Leno also owns some bad cars now, it would be great to see a remake of this with his modern. collection. I'm sure Vette at the opening scene was her own car. <br /> <br /> Typical movie of the 80s. Watch and enjoy. No computer generated crap!
