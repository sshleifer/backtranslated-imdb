Made just ten years after the actual events, set in the Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film is totally thrilling. It smells like sulphurous death awaiting the perpetrators of the world war. I have not seen this for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting to be walled in their cave. A little dialogue between two generals: "God exists?" "If He did, we would not go." Shame that this is no longer available for viewing or buying because it would be interesting to see and compare this film with the documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (also known as "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz
