A good movie with strong performances (especially the two tracks). The film is about two American girls who are caught with 6-pound heroin at an airport in Thailand. Both are thrown into prison and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out. All they need to do is find a Nick Parks who puts the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. So far, the story is not so original (has many similarities to the best Return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> The acting and beautiful photography of Newton Thomas Sigel make this movie worth watching. A 7 out of 10.
