I saw this in "Dances with Films," and it was incredible. I really did feel for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Your parents are not just getting divorced, but there's a monster behind you. <br /> <br /> It was both heartfelt and scary - there were several times when the audience shouted in genuine fear. I remembered a Japanese horror movie, except the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that's what separated "Jake's Closet" from the usual indy movie - an excellent script with compelling characters. In addition, by blending elements of the horror film with family drama, the film gets the best of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If you do not go out in theaters, definitely get the DVD. .
