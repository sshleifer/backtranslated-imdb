I love this movie, but the music at all alumni meetings is just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game happened in 1972. That means the protagonists formed in 1972. But almost all the music played in the dances, etc., are from the 1950's and the early 60's. Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last song to be played in a reunion or dance of old high school people are the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music from the 1970s - we all know that bleak time was musically. But it was not completely desolate, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found these dance scenes very shocking for my suspension of disbelief for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> This was a lousy director and / or producer.
