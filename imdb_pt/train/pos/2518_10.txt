This is, by all categories, the best movie I have ever seen. Forget Hollywood - your movies always suck - that's art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His final death wish leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from various Asian countries live. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is an intense experience that is based on the visual and emotional part of the film. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never did a movie touch me the way this movie does. And the actors are incredible - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without seeming strange. A great compliment to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> One last comment about this brilliant film is that it stars Gackt (formerly vocalist of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (lead singer of L 'Arc ~ en ~ ciel') in excellent roles as Sho and Kei. I'm amazed at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting, depending on how old he's acting. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you've never seen a movie, see Moon Child, the Crow (Brandon Lee) and the recently released Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All in their original languages, of course!
