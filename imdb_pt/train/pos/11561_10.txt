This friendly comedy confronts some bizarre characters. Especially, of course, the two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she could no longer endure her cleaning and cooking attacks. Then he tries to kill himself, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an unsuspecting and unreliable sports reporter who lives in divorce with his ex-wife in a single apartment. He offers his afflicted friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And then the problem starts because two opposing characters can not live together for long. Felix transforms Oscar's untidy apartment into a clean, flat exposure. He cleans and cooks all the time. After a short period, Oscar feels persecution mania ... Filmed theatrically and excellent, he acted. Above all, Jack Lemmon's piece is wonderful. He's the perfect clown. It makes us laugh, but in a tragicomic way. Look for the wonderful scene where the two men invite their two neighbors to dinner, because the Oscar needs to touch something softer than a bowling ball. While preparing the drinks, Felix sits down with the two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he begins to talk about time. A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he starts to cry and when Oscar comes back with the drinks, there are three people crying in the living room. The film is full of scenes that are both fun and touching at the same time. A clever and funny comedy with a lot of heart. 10 out of 10!
