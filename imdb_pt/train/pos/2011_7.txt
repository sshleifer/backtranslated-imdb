If you've never seen this movie and like old veteran actors, this is the movie for you. Watching Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin, with his cheeks sunk and a wonderful voice that sang some great old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) performed exceptionally well with lots of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake) gave a great supporting role alongside Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who performed classical piano and no comedy like he did in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see early in his career in the 1940s.
