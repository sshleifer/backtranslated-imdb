1985 was a good year for the films - maybe even great - but this losing a gong was a long way to convince fans that Oscar is little more than a hood ornament for good members of the group. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: such was the disdain of the Academy by one of its greatest directors; and one that had to wait another eight years before any prejudice would stop them from handing it over to the statue before it allowed them to give it to Schindler's List, which is arguably not so good (and I'm half Polish ). Do not get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not beating 'Out of Africa' (who won that year) either; but it was, in my opinion, a lesson behind this: an epic story of suffering and hope that has brought me to tears - and I'm not a big cry. Perhaps it was music (superb), or cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedian; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but at the time: who knew?
