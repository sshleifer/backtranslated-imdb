Although I was in this movie playing Sheriff Hodges, I still managed to get myself jumped in various places and believing in myself is not that easy. You can say that I'm biased about the movie, and, okay, I am, but I have not seen the product finalized until 12/27/2006 and I was extremely pleased. I'm not a fan of horror movies as such, but I love the old "B" movies and black and white Sci Fi movies. This movie will make you "think" that you know when something is going to happen, so it does not happen, so it happens. This will keep you completely unbalanced. I would suggest watching the film first, then the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that it was a real joy working with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be a part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
