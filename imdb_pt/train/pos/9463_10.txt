I loved "Dan in real life". A wonderful travel story for love, like You Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping, but not ridiculously full of jokes and rude jokes, and not so romantic that makes you want to vomit. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advice columnist who seems to be unable to sort things out in his own life. Until one day at a family reunion / meeting he meets and immediately connects with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche), a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed by a fuzzy filter that goes back to the premieres of classic cinema . The chemistry happens during a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie must be out for a previous appointment, and they must separate. <br /> <br /> We are later dealt with Dan's close and amusing relatives who not only take great breakfasts together, but also like to use the smart and sweetly Dan as the target of many bachelor jokes . What I liked so much was that although the characteristics of the family could be seen as disagreeable to some, I thought it was a great portrait of a large family that does not risk parody or gross exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close and loving group of people who are truly interested the best for Dan. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is nosy but never petty or gossipy; quirky, but never strange. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend that he brought to the family reunion. And so begins a roller coaster of nostalgia contained and fun to sprout. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I thought this movie was just amazing. It is not particularly "hip" or "clever", never very wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting humor as many comedies are in modern cinema. There is a good balance between narrative visuals and funny but real dialogues. in fact, at the beginning of the movie, the initial spark of love begins with an extravagant discussion in a classic Hollywood-style talk where the characters say what they are thinking out loud. <br /> <br /> So, I've probably wandered and repeated myself, but I recommend "Dan in Real Life." It's a great date movie, believe me, you're going to laugh, and only if you're a geek like me, you're going to get a teary eye. Full of fun and magical love, "Dan in real life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 of 4 stars Rating A
