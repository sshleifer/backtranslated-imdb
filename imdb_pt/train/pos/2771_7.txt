David and Bate-Seba are a lavish biblical Hollywood image produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Hayward (Battling), Raymond Massey (Nathan) and Kieron Moore ( Uriah). ) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based around the second book of Samuel of the Old Testament of the Holy Bible. King David followed, who as a child killed the giant Goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. A strong and secure king, David has nevertheless cases of the heart causing great problems. For the first time he spies Bathsheba taking a shower, is the beginning of a journey that covers adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgment of God being called. <br /> <br /> Typically for the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great and grandiose production. From the excellent scenery designs to the wonderful Technicolor (Leon Shamroy) photography, it is of sufficient quality to ensure the best of what the genre has to offer in terms of production values. Atypically, the film is sedated and depends on 99% of its value to be directed purely through dialogue. This is not one for action fans or for those who need a bit of swash to go with their buckle. This is a very humanistic image, in fact, do not miss the burning bush here, it is a story of biblical love peppered with sins of the heart. But that's no bad thing, because to break it, we think he's very well-acted {Peck has a stoic but vulnerable thing going well, and Hayward's taking it to the max}, and it's a good story driven with knowledge . skill by the often overlooked Henry King. And although some of the dialogues are admittedly undecided, the flow of characters is never interrupted when Phillip Dunne's screenplay (The Phantom and Mrs. Muir) draws attention. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a picture forgotten in terms of biblical genres / swords and sandals (most likely because it is a talent piece that has heart as its main selling point), but really worth the time of anyone interested in the most generous of genres. 7/10
