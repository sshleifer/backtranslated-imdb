Interesting mix of comments it would be difficult to add something constructive to. However, I will try. This was a very good action movie with some great plays. You will notice that I have specified the genre. I did not look at the lack of characterization, and I did not scold the acting. Enjoy yourself for what people are, an action film well above average. I could go on, but I made my comment.
