This is a movie I saw when it first came out, and I've seen it a few more times over the years. It's always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it skews work and capitalists alike. Only Sid seems out of the classic fight, despite being responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: do not read over if you have not yet seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, although presented in a plausible way. Ask yourself: could anyone sustain most of their weight in a single strand of tissue? That would cut off almost all the support. <br /> <br /> In addition, when cornered in an alley, Sid uses a garbage can lid as the shield of a knight. Beautiful symbolism. <br /> <br /> Someday, I'll get it on DVD.
