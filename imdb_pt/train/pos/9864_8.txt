I watched 'Ice Age' at the movies and enjoyed the movie. Despite the fact that the "Ice Age" has many scientific flaws and errors, such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even the location from where the story goes (look at North America, but has some characteristics of Iceland) for example) we can have some fun (unless you are very strict!) <br /> <br /> The planet is entering an ice age, and many animals are immigrating to the south , where it is warmer. Sid is an idiotic Sloth who is left behind by his own family, who no longer supports him. Walking on his way, he meets Manfred, or as he calls "Manny" a temperamental mammoth who does not care about extinction. or immigration and is going north. Concerned that he can be easily captured, Sid decides to follow Manfred and, in the middle of the journey, they meet a human mother with her baby. The mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and return the baby to humans. Diego, one of the Sabers, decides to follow them and help them to go to a shortcut to the humans' camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego is of a clan of saber that hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and also pretends to betray the two so that they become the food of the saber. What will happen, will depend on the behavior and consciousness of Diego ... also known as "The Ice Age" - Brazil
