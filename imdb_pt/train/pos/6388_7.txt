Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * It's officially Disney's first science fiction adventure. I'm not sure how this is needed (I like to understand), but this made me curious the first time I heard the description. <br /> <br /> * The preview seemed, for the most part, pretty cool. Of course, it was also "very enigmatic" according to some critics after the fact. <br /> <br /> * Apparently he did so badly that Disney said, "Damn it, let's relaunch 'Spy Kids.'" <br /> <br /> So, with all that said, how's the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm a sucker for lively fantasy that involves messing around with music and rampant special effects anyway, but "Atlantis" is awesome. It's a setback for all the CGI scenes in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so much so that it's almost like a Best-Of Show from the effects animator. The characters may not be as memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot is a bit boring, but this is not a movie you watch the plot. <br /> <br /> Here's a controversy that bothers me. The "failure" (as in, "only" absorbed, like, five hundred million or something, I know animators who would kill to see fifteen bucks of this) compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. I do not think that's true. How do you explain the movie "South Park"? What about "Final Fantasy"? Really, history and art are everything, not method. I do not know what Disney's return movie will be like, but I do not think they're out of the picture yet.
