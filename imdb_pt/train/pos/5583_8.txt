I think at least a few people watched on September 2nd at TCM. If you knew Hedy had to change his name to avoid being associated with this movie when he came to the United States. It was a major scandal and I realized that the original US release was so cut off by the censors that it was practically unintelligible. . I watched because I had just seen a documentary about "bad women," actresses of the US pre-film censorship board created in the early 1930s. It seemed to me that they gave themselves so much more than Hedy's most sensational shots in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy seemed positively innocent of it by today's standards, and it was good to see her pristine beauty. It was a good lyric movie to relax. I loved what it was: a simple novel. I watched it after pre-recording it during an early morning without sleep. I would love to see the first US release released for comparison.
