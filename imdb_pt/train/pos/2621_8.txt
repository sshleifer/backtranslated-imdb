Disney did it again. Brilliant as Timone and Pumba are brought back to life again to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting out to find his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumba and things change. Together, they look for the house that Timon wants and repeatedly fails, which is funny, as Timone gets more and more crazy. So Simba appears and we see more of his childhood than in the two previous films. The rest, you already know.
