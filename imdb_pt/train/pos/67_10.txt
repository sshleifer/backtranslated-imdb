The industry gave it up. The trailer does not do justice to the movie and when it opened it was in a hand full of screens. If people had the opportunity to see this, word of mouth would have been very successful. Each of the two leading actresses features emotional performances that really draw you to the story and especially the characters. I checked this based on Richard Roeper's recommendation or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that has never been fully released except on some screens. Which did not give a chance to be seen. Some movies go to video quickly because they are not that good. This is the decent Oscar and it is a tragedy on many levels that most will never hear of it. Perhaps through word of mouth, it earns followers on DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie, you should. Great performances of the 2 main actresses make this film. It could have been just another stereotypical teen movie after school special, but instead, it stands out from other movies worthy of note. Interrupted Girl comes to mind. If you like that, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without seeming melodramatic. Even though Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying for most of the movie, it's done so real that they do not appear as stereotyped or melodramatic characters. The movie will move you into many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better at this than at Traffic. I hope both actors have more roles that use their talents and let them shine. Watch this movie and, if you like, advise your friends not to get lost among all the box-office crap that comes out every year. This movie was buried while Spider-Man 2 is leading the way. What kind of word are we living in? AGHhh. So, to make the world right again, check this out and recommend it.
