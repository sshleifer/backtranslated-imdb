"Dirty" inspector Harry Callahan once again irritates his superiors with his covert approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation, he gets a simple case that takes him out of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a connection between a recent murder in the city and an out-of-town murder, which leads him to the trail of a murderer for revenge. <br /> <br /> As an entry into the Dirty Harry franchise, the movie begins with some very promising moments, including the legendary "Go ahead, make my day" line that Eastwood offers wonderfully through clenched teeth before isolating alone A theft. Very cool and just what fans can expect from him. However, the film soon changes gears and focuses on the mysterious killer of revenge. The problem is that this killer is not as mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is. This actually lessens the presence of the main character who ruled all his previous appearances in the movie, with the pardon of the pun, Magnum Force. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this new plot draws several parallels with Harry's own unorthodox discourse. methods and gives the dramatic depth of his character that was not there before, but fans who were looking for another bad ride from Harry will probably be a bit disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the movie on an exciting note, so if you do not mind something a little different, it's a good movie for the fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for Violence and Rape Scene
