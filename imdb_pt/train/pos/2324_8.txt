While watching this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in a rural area, I felt like I was a kid again! The swimming lake (it's called the "tank" in Central Texas), running through the field like a wild free spirit! The story was very convincing and I totally lost it and I cried until the end. Through the pain we spend in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
