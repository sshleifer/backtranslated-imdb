I'm ashamed to say that I missed "The Mother" when I was in theaters. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave 10 votes, one of the few I gave here. This independent English is shot with great care and quality. It drew me relentlessly. The story, discreet and purely human, is brutally honest and totally absorbing, thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is impressive. Punctuation is tied to the plot. The plot is epic, brilliantly dressed by the writer Hanif Kureishi in worldly lives. This story addresses major issues with the subtlety of an Impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of prizes won, despite many indications. It's simply one of my all-time favorite movies.
