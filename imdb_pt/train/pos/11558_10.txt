"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far outweighs its reputation. Everyone knows this, they sing the theme song, they complain about living with a sloppy "Oscar" or a fastidious "Felix" ... but they are sub-selling the movie without knowing it. This is not just about a cool guy who lives with a sloppy guy; is a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. It's also very funny from beginning to end, but it's the kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful, and simply terrible situations. So some viewers found the film a bit uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength. Plus, Matthau's bulldog face just rocks me! My favorite comedy, for a country mile.
