The film has a great genre story written. It has all the usual ingredients of Columbo; The way Lieutenant Columbo approaches and ties himself to the suspect, the way the mystery unfolds for him, the dog of Columbus, the cat and the mouse, which is great in this one and happily humorous, involving mainly the character Columbus. It's all written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept. Columbus hunting a detective / writer murder writer had been done more than once before in a movie Columbus. It's also an extremely well directed film by James Frawley, who later directed five more films in the '70s and' 80s. He provided the film with style and some truly great and memorable sequences. <br /> <br /> It's one of the slowest movies in Columbus, though it does not have a very long running time. This style and approach do not always work well for a film of Columbus, but in this film he does, which is perhaps not the least thanks to the acting performances of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of Columbus's films also starred in a well-known big star or a star of the early days of filmmaking, like the movie Its Killer. This movie starring the unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She has not starred in a slew of movies throughout her career, but she is still well known to some, especially for her role in "Rosemary's Baby," which also earned her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual acting style that some people may not like. She earned four more Oscar nominations throughout her career, prior to her "Rosemary's Baby" win in 1969. She also has great interaction with Peter Falk in their sequels. <br /> <br /> The film also stars a young man still GD Spradlin. I say young because I only know him from his last productions out of his career, despite the fact that he is already 57 years old at the time of Columbus' production. He is still alive, but has retired from acting since 1999. <br /> <br /> An even better movie entry than Columbo. <br /> <br /> 8/10
