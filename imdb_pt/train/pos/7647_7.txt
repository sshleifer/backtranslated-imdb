Okay, so it lends a bit of "It's a Wonderful Life", but that was 44 years before this movie, so why not a re-try. Belushi is having a rotten 35 year birthday. He did not pick up his Wheaties, his coffee, and lost his job. The capper is when his self described "big blue piece of sh **" car breaks at the end of the day. He heads for an empty bar to ask for a trailer. While waiting, he is recognized by bartender (Caine) as the kid who lost the city's baseball championship 20 years earlier. This makes him think about what life would have been like if he had won the game. He discovers when, unbeknownst to him, Caine serves a potion of movement in a glass that gives him a mansion, the prom queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him the president of the sporting goods company from which he is canned . Caine later reveals himself as the one who is responsible for this change, but Belushi is not fully on board. He never fully fits, and in a plot development that does not kill the movie, but still strange, he tries to woo his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to someone else. The good move is that they do not spend that much time on it, as basically they rip "Ghost" with Belushi constantly telling Hamilton things she just might know. It also brings a dramatic and mushy element as two of their lovers recover in the shadows, the new Russian wife and her unbalanced lover, Cox. But the keys to the film are the somewhat time-consuming beginning and the joyful ending. Also great work from the big and recognizable cast, as Belushi is very friendly, very attractive ladies chosen, and Caine is perfectly easy as the title dear. Strange that this was Belushi's second film of 1990 dealing with him receiving an alternative riches lifestyle, which was found in "Taking Care of Business". Although similar, both films are on the same level of laughter provided. So check this out for a fun exploration of "what if?"
