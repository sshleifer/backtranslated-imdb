Now I've always been a fan of the Full Moon puppet work. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works wonderfully, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first-class job. Gary Graham, who really makes his mark on TV in shows like ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he may be an action star who kicks his ass and bears the name. The stop motion effects could have been a bit better. The color was wrong, they look plastic to me, instead of the metal they should be. But that's a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the Jox Robot, whether you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you'll like this movie. 9 STARS OUTSIDE 10.
