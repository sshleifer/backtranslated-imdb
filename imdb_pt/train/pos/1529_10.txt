Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I watch regularly on TV now. The way all main characters have something to do in each episode makes it so different from today's shows where they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone is pushed aside. The way Mark's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he's thinking, and if you think so, it's wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder addressed a variety of topics, not just in cases, but in each of the characters' personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> As for the elderly? I'm 24 years old!! I do not think I can be classified as old yet. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so I can watch them all in order. They seem to be doing this with many other shows from the same time, so they can hurry up a bit!
