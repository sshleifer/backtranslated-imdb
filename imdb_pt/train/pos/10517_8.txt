Prodigious production values ​​and solid performances in this direct adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classic on the game of marriage within and between classes in eighteenth-century provincial England. Northam and Paltrow are a wholesome mix as friends who need to go through jealousies and lies to discover they love each other. Good humor is a sustaining virtue that helps a lot to explain the accessibility of the material of aged origin (which has been attenuated somewhat in its severe skepticism). I liked the look of the film and how the scenes were made, and I did not think it depended on successions of photos like most other films of the 80s and 90s. Very good results
