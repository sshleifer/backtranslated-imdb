Like the gentle giants who make up the last half of the title of this film, Michael Oblowitz's latest production is graceful, but it's also slow and heavy. Last tour of the producer, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring film of sharks, but they did it somehow. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was the acceptable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wonderful worlds beneath the surface of the ocean. But even this was only acceptable. The lack of focus on some scenes made the production look amateurish. With dolphins and whales, the technology is almost wasted. Cloudy scenes and many close-ups of the movie's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's impressive 3D capabilities. There are very few depth or variety scenes. Close-ups of these incredible creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the camera field so there is no depth contrast. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you have Shark-Week in the telegram, his introspective and monotonous treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
