"A Thief in the Night" is a film that was generally overlooked by movie fans in general because of its low budget (and of course) and its subject matter - the Rapture of the true Christian church and the fate of those left behind. However, it was an exciting story that made the viewer and definitely made him or her revisit their relationship with Jesus Christ. He touched everyone - even showing a pastor who preached the Word, but did not believe, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This film, and its sequence "Distant Thunder", are obligatory to watch films. Even with the new "Left Behind" series coming out, telling the same story on a much bigger budget, the impact is still the same - "A Thief in the Night" has broken the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
