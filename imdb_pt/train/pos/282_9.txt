This is undeniably the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average type of fps shoot-everything-that-moves (which I usually do not care much about), but acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and above all the amazing atmosphere. I love Scrye, which allows you, at certain places in games, to see or hear events that have happened in the past. The only game I had to do regular breaks after a few minutes of game only because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a big fan of horror, especially Clive Barker's stories and movies, and taking part in a horror story like that makes me crave more games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more engaging story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of fps, and maybe the game was a bit short?)
