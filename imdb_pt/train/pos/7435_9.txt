I saw this video for the first time 15 years ago. I thought it was great and I still do. I am a former English teacher (college and university) and a lover of English Romantic poetry, so Coleridge values ​​me a lot. Anything that might damage the beauty of the poem or the power of history would not win my vow of excellence. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially the high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to her. Ok, so there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can dismiss Gustave Doré's illustrations as part of the presentation? The comment above, which in only four lines rejects the video as a garbage, is grossly unfair and imperceptible. I'm a friend of the producer, but that's not my reason for this comment. On the contrary, I am defending a work of art that I think has value at all levels. It is fitting to take Coleridge's poem to students in a way that arouses their appreciation and arouses their sympathy for the lesson the former sailor conveys.
