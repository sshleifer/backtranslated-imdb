Not only has this movie been better than the entire final season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for the TV I've ever seen! Looking at the "Top 250", I see that only a small-screen movie managed: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it's time to raise this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I did not care. I just LOVED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!
