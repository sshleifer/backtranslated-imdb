"Once in the life" is a very good film. However, it is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations. The film succeeds in portraying "life" in anecdotal and believable ways in New York City neighborhoods where drug problems are important. This representation is in turn used as the decoration of a more thoughtful and suspenseful drama, supported by powerful dialogues (however, I had difficulty understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue. . There is a bit of overkill at times, but I think it fits in well with Fishburne's overall orientation to the film, which gives more importance to reflection than just being an exercise in style, notably in time / action management. The characters, although not simple, are easy to relate to and actors do a good job of impersonating them. By the way, I really enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you're not too puritanical, you should enjoy watching the movie once, twice, three times. I rated the movie 9/10.
