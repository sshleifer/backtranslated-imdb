I loved it and it was so broken that we were not doing it another season !!! I wish they were! was the best show of all time !!!!!! there is probably no chance of them deciding not to cancel the show! ha ha I wish there were! I would be so excited !! I really would! I miss it! and was especially broken for not knowing what happens to Jason !! I think they should do another .... I also think it's silly that you have to write ten lines to post a comment .. makes your comment drag on .. and no one is going to read it! I really want to know what would have happened between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they could spin off !!
