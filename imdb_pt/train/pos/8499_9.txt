A very funny film between East and West influenced by the closure of the GM factory in Flint, Michigan, in the 1980s, and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Located in western Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
