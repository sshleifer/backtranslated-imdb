I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and I've watched many of his films so far and none of them stopped making me laugh. Neither How to lose friends and Alienate People. <br /> <br /> This movie is essentially about a good man how to annoy people. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that could make him famous. But in the end it ends up doing, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of lap dance. It's one of those movies where you can be happy when it's over.
