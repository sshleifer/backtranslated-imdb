This is a movie that shows love through the ages. The film consists of Keaton looking for a lady of love in the stone age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual Weak Buster and he fights Wallace Beery for his beloved. Of the three time periods, I think I liked the Roman more, although I admit that it was also the most tacky. I really enjoyed the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a fantasy, as well as the strange car race in the snow - but what I really enjoyed most was seeing all of Keaton's incredible stunts. However, all three time periods were good old-fashioned and the film, although not the best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable film. Check out!
