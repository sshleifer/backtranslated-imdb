My brief commentary for this movie is go get it. Chances are you will be positively surprised by a diversity of superbly exploited elements in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing into the room in every way possible, will not push his nerves to the edge ... 2 thumbs up!
