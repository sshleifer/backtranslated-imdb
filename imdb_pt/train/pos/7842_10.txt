so in the middle of the season, I got so involved with school and with my activities that I did not realize that the show had been canceled halfway, which sucks. <br /> <br /> I think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and waited for it every Thursday after the CO. Can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to try to watch the show only to find out that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not too happy with the fox now. more so after discovering that NO FINDING WAS FILMED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish to see what happens. a half-filmed show is like a half-done car, it's practically useless. fox, film the damn final and give some peace to the fans of the program.
