I'm not a John Cleese completist (though I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant"), but I'm a fan, and when I saw that neglected session, on a shelf in my local Blockbuster, I decided to try it. What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the most fun 50-minute viewing experiences I've ever had. The writing is typically English "goon show" schtick. In fact, as an audio sketch, this would not be out of place on a "Firesign Theater" album, but the execution and timing are right and this raises "Strange Case" to the kind of jaw-dropping performance that can create fanatics by British comedies throughout life. <br /> <br /> The Brits have a satirical satirical satirical matching gift with character tics and timing, and the creators use both for a good effect here.Cleese portrait of "Holmes" seems to owe a lot to "Inspector Clouseau" of Arkin and the seller, however Cleese has such a talent for physical comedy that he more than possesses his own. here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a genius, but invincibly incomprehensible imbecile, with such timing and delivery so incredible that he becomes the best aspect of the movie. I had never heard of Lowe before (his past seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with that performance as far as I'm concerned. Some people may not care for "Strange Case ...", especially if the British whim is not their "cuppa tea". But I am extremely happy to see this before disappearing from view.
