For my project from the humanities room to the school, I chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just watched and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow." It's such a convincing story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless and although it's not a happy ending forever, it's very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks out for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it a lot and now I want to know what happens next!
