Okay, first of all I got this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was made in stereoscopic 3D. It's mostly, but whenever the main character is in his car, the movie falls for 2D! What!!?!?! It's not so hard to shoot in a car !!! SECOND: The story is not very good. There are many things wrong with that. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why are they showing all the killings at the beginning of the movie! It made the movie suck whenever someone was going to be killed !!! Watch for a good laugh, but do not waste your time buying. Just download or something cheap.
