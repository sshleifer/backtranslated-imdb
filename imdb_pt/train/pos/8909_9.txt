This is a well-known one, so I will not go deep into it. The basic story is about two teenagers who discover a strange goo of goo coming to earth via the meteor. Human contact with this ball of mud burns the flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies, making it larger. No one believes in teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it looks like the bubble can not be stopped. It's very well done for age and unlike many other 50's movies, the pace is pretty fast. The story is very original, making it a must-see for any fan of old science fiction films and monsters. If you can enjoy the horror of the 80s, be sure to check out the remake of '88 as well.
