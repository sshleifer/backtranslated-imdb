This is not the Masterpiece Theater. You should not go into it expecting this. This is pure fun girl with the most fantastic cast of female leads. As someone said here, this is the movie Baby Mama should be. And the only downside I see in this movie is that Tina Fey was not there - moreover, it shows the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, but if you really observe, you will know that it has many messages and deep meaning for any of us who would like to be able to come back and do it all over again, knowing what we know now. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
