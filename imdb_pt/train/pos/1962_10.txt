What an exciting ride! Twisted and thought-provoking. Once again, Sharon Stone takes her beautiful and mysterious character from writer Catherine Tramell impeccably. The original basic instinct happens in San Francisco. The sequence takes place in London, where Catherine has moved now. Both bustling cities are known for thrill, haute couture and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to have residence. David Morrisey, ("Derailed"), plays the role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension - all "basic instincts." Mind folds everywhere. Great script. From the opening scene of the climax to the surprise ending, this movie is anything but annoying! Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
