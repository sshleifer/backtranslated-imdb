I must thank the VCD / DVD distributors in Hong Kong that I paid only $ 1.4 and could have such an amazing pleasure. <br /> <br /> Adultery? How common in our modern days. Eva took her two children and kidnapped Nick to chase Luis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants her revenge done, but in the end, she also commits the same crime as Luis: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small indie production, Vivian Naefe has dealt with the initial problems in modern marriage. a light heart. How can one dare to treat marriage seriously in this fast-food period, where people are now more physically, mentally and technologically mobile? Marital commitment requires a price too high that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but he fell in love with Eva after the kidnapping trip that forced him to experience a lot of growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers may feel happy about the end because Eva and Nick come together, well, this should be the biggest payoff to their spouse's unfaithful act. However, I want a sequence, I want to see how the four would develop after this exchange. Maybe they can go back, as someone can be so sure about the unstable love relationship. <br /> <br /> Good acting and good scenarios. The two small children's actors should not be neglected, especially the boy, when he cries at the hotel's reception in Venice. And of course, how can we forget the "bella, bella" scenery of the city.
