Words are not seriously enough to convey the emotional power of this film; is one of the most painful you have ever seen but the ending is one of the most loving, tender and emotionally rewarding you could hope for. All the actors in all roles are great, especially a wise and discreet Jamie Lee Curtis, a very tormented and distressed Ray Liotta, and a turnaround from Tom Hulce that should have prepared him for every award in the book. (He is the # 1 choice for Best Actor of 1988 in Danny Peary's "Alternate Oscars.") The last half hour borders on melodrama, but the film wins every one of its tears - and unless you're made of stone , there will be many of them.
