Gene Kelly came up with some really great ideas for musicals, while with MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative powers working with the musical unit Arthur Freed. Hard to believe when you watch An American In Paris, that players never left the lot back at MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative issue under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed blended with some background setting photos. The idea for the film originated with Kelly, who simply wanted to make a film with an extensive ballet sequence involving George Gershwin's sound poem, An American in Paris. It sounded good to Arthur Freed, who approached Ira Gershwin, who said it was okay with him, as long as they used other material from Gershwin. Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin's music that Irving Berlin usually had. No non-Gershwin music note is heard at An American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me, which are not real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who was a cool guy in writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story that is admittedly fine. All about an ex-GI played by Gene Kelly, who after World War II never left France, just settled into an apartment on the Left Bank and began to become a hungry artist. He lives with the eccentric composer Oscar Levant and this sounds like a redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another American expatriate played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as a painter, if he reciprocates in other matters. But Kelly falls in love with a shop girl played by Leslie Caron in her movie debut. Caron also has the musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested here. <br /> <br /> Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris is the first movie I saw as a movie in flight on the first plane ride I've ever done. I still remember flying from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport, seeing Gene Kelly doing I've Got Rhythm. My favorite number in the movie, however, is Tra-La-La, which Kelly sings and dances around the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point Kelly dances on top of the grand piano. In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote where he said that in the American ballet sequence in Paris it would be made against the background of the French impressionists that he thought the public would take instead of a realistic scenario in the streets or in the back. Then it happened that way. Kelly made long ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But he overcame them all. It still does in my opinion and that includes some of Gene Kelly's later movies. <br /> <br /> In an upset surprise with the Oscar, An American In Paris was chosen like best film in 1951, beating the much favored To Streetcar Named. Wish. I think fantasy has outpaced realism that year. Big budgets also have an edge on these things as well. <br /> <br /> Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever made and since studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.
