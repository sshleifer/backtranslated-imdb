The plot does not begin to describe the film: a man is writing a movie, or rather * this * film. It's totally self-referential to the point where you think it's going to bend like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, like "Waking Life" but more Zen-oriented and actually much better in my opinion. At one point there are interviews on the street and then you see the filming of these people being filmed and then you find out that their responses are written when you continue to flank your lines. There are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD so I can watch it again more carefully. Seen at the Cinequest (San Jose, California Film Festival) on 2/25/2002.
