Sleepwalkers are creatures that drain the life force completely from humans to survive ... but they can only use virgins (it is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who needs to feed his mother, Mary (Alice Krige). He goes after the nice Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will she escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a great horror movie. Quick, a lot of blood and blood and a nice, twisted sense of humor. There are many references in jokes to horror fans (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Also Krause is excellent (who would have thought he could act after "Return to the Blue Lagoon") as did Kirge and Amick. But I find this movie boring. <br /> <br /> It was written on the screen by Stephen King and is maddeningly vague. Sleepwalkers are never fully explained. Where are they from? Why are they called that? Why does the child have to feed the mother? Why do cats hate them and can they kill them? What are your powers after all (at one point Krause makes a car disappear and change color and style!)? Why do they need to feed on people's life force? Why does it have to be just virgins? Why is the son having sex with his mother? None of this is explained, leaving the story confused. It's too bad because, with those issues aside, this is a terrific horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Quick, bloody and very fun. If only the script was better. Also a pretty explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige has been edited (you can tell) to get an R rating. I can only give this to a 7.
