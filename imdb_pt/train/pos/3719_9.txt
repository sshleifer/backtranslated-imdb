Just picked up at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story, told in a convincing way. The portable camera approach to action scenes increased the intensity of these scenes (in documentary style, not Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a big budget to produce an exciting film. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, particularly the actor focusing on the events of the movie, Boz.
