While listening to an audio book, Scott Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear his voice and this brought back to my disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the show's history. What a shame and embarrassment in the network for not giving this program a full chance of seasons. This was a great show to watch with a great cast. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second chance that the witch was a great show, too, but they took "Invasion" and that was also something totally different from watching, not the same old old themes. Why can not the networks get it right?
