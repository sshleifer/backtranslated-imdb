The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his very short career in ARTHUR, 1981, an incredibly fun and alternately touching story that generates hot smiles, loud laughter, and an occasional tear if you're in a good mood. Moore received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "runs cars, plays tennis, caresses women, but he has weekend breaks and is his own boss." Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is the spoiled daughter of a gangster in disguise. Things get tricky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a Queens waitress / actress who steals ties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the funniest shows of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his flawless turn as Artur's butler and best friend, Hobson, whose contempt for Arthur's behavior encompasses more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions from Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's insane grandmother. The film was directed with a watchful eye to the comedy of a director for the first time named Steve Gordon, who unfortunately died the following year. There was also a forgettable sequence several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.
