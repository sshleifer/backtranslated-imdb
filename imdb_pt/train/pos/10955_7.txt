Originally, I did Sarah's show with a pretty fat 8, but I've struggled a bit with her mood lately and a skinny 7 is what's settled. I'm gonna explain. <br /> <br /> You'll like Sarah's humor. or you will not. If you do not, I doubt anyone can persuade you. You know who you are and you're perfectly fine, but you know that too. Moving on, the first season has given us fantastic moments about Sarah, her friends and family and her pursuits in life. In one memorable episode, she is "pulled" by police officer Jay, whom she meets for the first time. "Do you know why I'm here?" he asks. "Why do you have all the C's in high school?" She responds with curiosity. It seemed to be a genuine question. This is funny in my book. Sarah may come to you from strange angles. In another episode, his affair with God was remarkably funny. God being stingy and jealous added wonderfully to the joke. It's clever, it's a distorted view, but it would show us the truth in the mood and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Although not yet without some new and inventive comedy, it seems that we have slipped a bit for banal jokes of fart and fart, simply. I get a good laugh here and there, but a lot of it seems to be filling as she, and the writers, struggle to foster some original material. Sophomoric and tiring are the feelings I have for the episodes lately, but I have destroyed the gems that I think (the tortoise) and waiting for her to turn around. I was a fan of her "Jesus is Magic" routine and would like to think that I understand what she is capable of. Let's get back to this.
