It contains spoilers. "Hollow Man" is probably the weaker film than Paul Verhoeven, director of great films like "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" has done. <br /> <br /> This is probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with a totally mediocre script, and he did his best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is quite good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the movie falls in the second part, if it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a clone "Alien" too bad. The ending is especially ridiculous <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon keeps coming back to life after a series of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) kill him. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is rather superficial, in fact: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated. <br /> <br /> But in general, Verhoeven manages to be well above average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 stars
