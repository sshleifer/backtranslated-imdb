I saw this in the early 70's (when I was 16), and despite the long and slow setup, meetings, riots, etc., once the desert section began, everything fit the context and I loved it. (Still, it has aged very well.) At the time, I was in what appeared to be a small minority. All criticism seemed to focus on lack of action and narrative. Fortunately I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> It shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political fragmentation, agitation, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization, and deception that are to come. <br /> <br /> The appreciation of this masterful movie grown up, and I'm happy about it.
