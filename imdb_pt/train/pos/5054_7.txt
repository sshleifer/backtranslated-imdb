Richard Attenborough, who has already given us magnificent films like "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi", once again surprises us by making a beautiful hymn to nature. In fact, the vast and (at that time) unexplored territory of Canada helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes captured by the film camera. If the film is really based on a true story, it again becomes evident that "men of vision" are actually men who live beyond their time, with a historical perspective that only Time will give them reason. The cinematography is magnificent, like the main cast of Pierce Brosnan, whose performance is due to the hands of master of Attenborough. A pleasant surprise is the appearance of Annie Galipeau as Archie's beloved. Movie that should appear on a list of those who really love nature ...
