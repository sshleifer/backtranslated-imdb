I do not like "degree inflation" but I just had to give it a 10. I can not think of anything I did not like about it. I saw you last night and I woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me with J Lo and Richard Gear will be great, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking to me that I find it difficult to think of any shape that could be improved, or your configuration changed to a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story I thought deserved to be seen, and with fight scenes with fists or shooting guns or whatever! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed well-developed, even non-primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting, and the cast seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find a good musical movie these days, and maybe it does not qualify (there is a lot of learning to dance but not to sing), but I really think Gene Kelly and others who have argued a place for dance in our lives would have thought very well in that movie and the role of dance in helping tell a story about a middle-aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something ... he did not knows exactly what. For the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing this.
