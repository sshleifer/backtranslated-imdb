This is a CGI animated film based on an animated series in French 2D. The series ran briefly on Cartoon Network but its execution was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people I know "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chu, the type of heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, who, along with Hector, is a dragon that looks like a dog. Travel the world offering their services as dragon hunters, but never being paid. In their lives comes Zoe, the fairy-tale love niece of a king who is going blind. It seems that the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all the knights that the king sent never returned or if they return they return as ashes. In desperation, the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world's dining room. Zoe's clear tags over ... <br /> <br /> What can I say other then why is this movie hiding under a rock? This is a great movie that is completely off the radar except as an unlikely Oscar nominee. It's a beautifully designed, fantastic-looking movie (The world it happens to have floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly made me "Wow." The English Voice with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (I think Steve Bucsemi) is top notch. Equally great is the script that does not speak to the audience, using some real expressions not usually heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). Everything is very well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some of the bits last a long time, but at the same time it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, check this out. It's one of the best animated films of 2008 and it's on my list of surprises for 2009.
