This is a great movie for bodybuilders and female fans! I think Sue Price did a great job on this movie series (Nemesis 2, 3, 4) and proved to be a great fighter. It has a very striking appearance and an iron will to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although not a great movie and Sue Price's acting skills are not the best I've ever encountered in my life, the movie itself was something incredible, a priceless jewel for fans of female bodybuilders action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous science fiction films, like Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A. Putin has released in this film a very talented bodybuilder who put all his energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed this movie and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequence than 3). Too bad it has not yet appeared on DVD :-(
