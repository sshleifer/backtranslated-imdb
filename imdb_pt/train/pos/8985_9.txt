Although DiG! was being hailed as being the closest the music industry is as it is highly manufactured. The director misled the public into believing that the Brian Jonestown Massacre disappeared from the face of the Earth after 98. And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown was overcome. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is infinitely quoteable and is an interesting watch as we see two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. One of the best things this movie has for him is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for the music and the two fantastic bands.
