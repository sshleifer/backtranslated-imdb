An old saying goes, "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital." This has been updated in recent years for "If you think you have problems, watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer's!" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave it a seven - it's ok, but not great. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just as the daily talk show is advertised as "an hour of your life you will never go back!" All familiar themes are here ... unfaithful husbands / boyfriends, the wildest public on television, women blinking Jerry, etc. The shock was watching Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") the trailer's mother and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as his equally useless daughter, performing sexual favors for practically all men with whom they came into contact. The men (including the team producer) were presented as par excellence lunkheads who deserved what they received. I do not want to spoil or reveal everything, but the movie is displayed as the daily program. Here in Phoenix, he is shown two hours a day, and after that, everything seems to pale. Once again, I give this movie a seven ... it's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small doses of one hour.
