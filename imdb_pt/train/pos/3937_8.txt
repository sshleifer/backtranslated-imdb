The beginning of Abe Lincoln's career is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen images of the true Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a false nose, is as strange as Lincoln, with his voice, delivery, walk, and other mannerisms-exactly as Lincoln is supposed to be. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films it has made with the Fonda, is at the top of its form, evoking perfectly America in the early nineteenth century. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder that Lincoln defends and the court scenes are very well done. The support cast includes many of Ford's regular customers. This was Alice Brady's last film when she died months after its release.
