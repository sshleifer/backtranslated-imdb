This is a very beautiful film. The color photography is beautiful as it shows the richness of the Metropolitan Opera House in bright colors. Other inner scenes in various mansions, etc., are equally brilliant. As for music, what can be said is that Lanza's voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the world's best-known and beloved arias. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy, because her soprano voice combines with the voice of Lanza in a delicious harmony. Of course, Hollywood has taken its customary freedoms with Caruso's life story. There is very little in the plot related to actual events. For example, the facts concerning his death are wholly fabricated and unrelated to the truth. There are some very good sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several photos of him. These sites can be located using any good search engine. There are also several books available on his life history. But the fictional story does nothing to ruin this beautiful film. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and the members of the choir are the true stars of this film. Enjoy, I know I'm sure.
