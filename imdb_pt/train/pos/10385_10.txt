It's been a while since I watched this movie, and the series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine at General Lee. When Boss Hogg expelled the dukes from his farm, Bo and Luke sneaked into Hogg's local construction site and found samples of coal. They soon realize that Boss Hogg is going to undress in Hazzard County, unless the dukes can stop him with the help of his beautiful cousin Daisy. My only two problems with the film were that Burt Reynolds was not right for the role of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was very serious. Also, I recommend the DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
