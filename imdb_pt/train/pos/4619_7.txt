First, I'm a big fan of the 1980s movies, and Jennifer Conelly as well. So yesterday, I went into a local book / movie store and found a copy on VHS. I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I took it home and put it on the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age now, I relate more to films like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. We all have those little passions when we're younger. And if it does not work, we're heartbroken and we think we'll never get over it. But of course. Oftentimes. It's that kind of sweet quality I really have from that movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is all. The characters are interesting and well-developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies, movies for teenagers in particular, or for anyone who just wants to come back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
