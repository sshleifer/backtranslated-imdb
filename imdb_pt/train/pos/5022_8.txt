Fragility - 8/10 - It's non-sensitive title and "Bill Paxton heads" headline aside, this is a good old-fashioned old-fashioned biblical horror thriller. In the end, it may end up being just the southern gothic cousin of Kubrick "The Shining" - but, hey, this is a very fun notion. It also has a doozy of a twist in history ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch up late at night on the basic cable and scare the beejesus out watching themselves. Very bad director Bill Paxton had to go and hire himself to star in ... oh well .... still a hell of a good rental.
