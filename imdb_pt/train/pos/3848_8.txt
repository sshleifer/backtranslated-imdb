Gerard is a writer with a somewhat hyperactive imagination. He is also homosexual and catholic prone to Catholic guilt and somewhat clairvoyant, or so it seems. On a trip to Flushing, he is "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of the brute trade he's imagining from afar, he decides to stick around. After all, forced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then he notices that Christine's three previous husbands died violently. Christine murdered them and he or her boyfriend, Herman, will be the "fourth man"? Verhoeven's melodrama overheated and over-energized is a delightful blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and a great deal of red color. Most of the time it seems and seems like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or an invention of Gerard's imagination. The fun is in figuring it out. Moreover, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more sympathetic character than both the generous presumptuous and the haughty herman means that we would hardly want to cheer for any of the men over her. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard's punishment can not come soon enough. Super performances, too, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily the best film from Verhoeven to his wonderfully subversive sci-fi piece "Starship Troopers".
