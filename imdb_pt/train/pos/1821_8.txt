When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store), this was among my favorite movies. I had not heard much about it since then, nor did I remember anything about it, having been forgotten following the other probably better films of Don Bluth. I managed to locate it a few weeks ago, however, and was pleasantly surprised again. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the entertainment is delightful and the songs are memorable. There are a few flaws in continuity, if you look hard enough, but they usually do not hurt the plot, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even with a little misty eyes if you're an animal lover). The characters are credible (maybe even a little too adult for the younger viewers) as well. Two paws up, and for those of you who have not seen it for some time, it's definitely worth watching again.
