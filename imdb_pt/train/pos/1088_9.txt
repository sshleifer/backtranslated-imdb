Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfect as a middle-class couple who want to build the home of their dreams. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are many good laughs (even if the story is a little thin). Be sure to entertain the fans of the stars or the Hollywood comedy style of the 1940s. A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a series of all expenses, which must have sounded rather exaggerated for a 1948 audience. he makes his way out, he assures the client (Grant) that maybe he could get a $ 100 reduction from the total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
