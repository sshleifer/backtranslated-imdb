I approached this film with low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and claps hands in the ballroom dance films of the last few years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is good and the dance is colorful, for me the film is not about dancing. It is about the Japanese institution itself that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the full family and the big mortgage and an enthusiasm for life. He is attracted to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio that he passes during his journey and this leads him to try the ballroom dance. Also the Japanese is the fact that the lascivious motives that started their new passion are clarified, but somehow accepted, at least at some point, by the family and the public. Attitudes toward ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural imports into Japan. Cultural contrasts are therefore intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the color, dance and enthusiasm of the players make this movie fun to watch.
