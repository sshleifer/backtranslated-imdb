Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt. He will see her there, where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's friend. Stella become very close. Later, Simone dies. Trelkovsky begins to think that the owner and the neighbors are trying to turn him into Simone so that he too jumps out the window. Loceire (The Tenant) of 1976 is the last film of the trilogy of apartments of Polanski. The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.Roman Polanski does not do good job just like the director, but his acting is also superb.Isabelle Adjani with his large glasses is wonderful.The landlord, Monsieur Zy is played by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. The fantastic Shelley Winters is the Concierge. The Tenant is something very scary from time to time. That gives a lot of that psychological scare. This movie is not the easiest to understand or explain, but it makes everything so fascinating.
