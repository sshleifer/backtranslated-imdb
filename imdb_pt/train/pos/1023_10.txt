This show has been my escape from reality in the last ten years. I regretfully miss that. Although Atlantis filled the hole a little bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on television anyway) was done with great taste. Robert wrote something that seemed close to reality. Like he was trying to explain what it was like on the show set. (Everyone working together for such a long period of time has to go up and down. But, over the years, they have become family.) I thought this was a wonderful way to end, despite criticism from anyone else. The SG1 was something special and, from time to time, carried me through the limits of disbelief and astonishment. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From the first episode I was hooked. The mix of action, science, drama and especially comedy worked so well that it made me keep wanting more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the program so fresh and fun for so many years. It inspired me to do many things that I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the movies next year and I really hope there are some of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
