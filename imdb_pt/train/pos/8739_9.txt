This is a FUNNY movie. It has all the usual components of Disney (music, great variety of characters, history, appeal), intertwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of lesser known actors such as Antz and Price of Egypt. /> <br /> The characters work very well and have a strong appeal, and humor is directed to a broad level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in excellent cinemascope format, which enhances the movie experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times, and I plan to bring more friends to see you this weekend. . Many skeptics saw this movie by my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work on a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no one has ever left this movie without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Look, and do not get discouraged because it's lively. . You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the final credits! The mistakes and the mistakes in the end are the funniest part of the movie, which is full of laughs everywhere.
