The Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who travel spontaneously to Thailand and end up in jail after being caught with drugs planted in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, like "Return to Paradise", but instead, the film chose to focus little on the situation of the girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale perform excellent performances, and the film is much more about the interaction between them - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and testing their friendship, and finally the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. . This film chooses not to go too deeply into politics or even the harshness of prison life (which is a bit undercover), and focuses more on these issues of friendship. <br /> <br /> There were some plot holes here, and some parts that did not look believable or realistic. We do not feel the real fear or despair of your situation as well as we could have. And we have very little feeling of life outside the prison walls, with Bill Pullman playing the supposedly despicable lawyer who actually ends up having a heart of gold. In short, this should, by all rights, have been a film much darker than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall, I liked it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the plot had enough twists to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
