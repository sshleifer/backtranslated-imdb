This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I have not seen any cameo in the movie, but it's still very good. It's similar to the Anchor in the humor department, but I think it's a better movie. In fact, there is a point. If you are going to see a lot of T & A, you will be disappointed. Just a good movie together !!!! If you have nothing to do during the day or need a lot of humor, you'll see that this is a really good movie. I definitely think Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is correct. I mean, I do not really like Ebert in most movies, but that's the movie I'm going to agree on. The film contains a story good enough to believe that this type of person is out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yes, of course, you are ridiculed when it is discovered, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person he did in this movie and yet it's still funny.
