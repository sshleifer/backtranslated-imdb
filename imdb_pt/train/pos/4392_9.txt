I really enjoyed this movie.Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as Jake. He has to be one of the best actors I've ever seen. And I was surprised there were so many funny lines throughout the movie. He was extremely good at it too, though I've never seen him deliver a comic book line before. The movie gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what it's like to be all of them. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she did very well. Lots of exciting dinners. A good tour. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire. Check out the House of Cider Rules. One of the best ever.
