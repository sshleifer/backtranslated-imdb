I can not say that this movie deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being hoarded by some critics. Yes, it is bogged down by an overly padded time, hamfisted issue and an over-reliance on special cheese effects. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get the average audience through it without checking the clock. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some funny funny lines, a talented and sincere cast, and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the "core" team, and Garofalo and Studi do a great job adding conflict and variety to the team. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall, although each had some chance of shining. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic "underdog-do-good" stuff. There are no surprises, since you know they will triumph. What makes it worth it are not the absurd and gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Underneath all, these people are children of heart, who just want to do right. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional foundation. See Azaria's relationship with her grieving mother; Macy's captivating innocence in her reluctance to accept Cap. The secret identity of the incredible; Stiller's anger (not unlike that weird and strange child you knew and who always went into fury shakes and helpless in the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge her father. This childish belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the real appeal of superhero comics; and, beneath its parody exterior, "Mystery Men" shows us why these vulgar stragglers of comics matter to many. <br /> <br /> It never reaches a satisfactory whole due to the large number of half-cooked dishes. subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is so much fun that it makes up for it. The fact that it should be a good and absurd fun seems to be lost in some of the reviewers here, so I'll give you a caveat: if you're the kind of spectator who finds the pleasure of a cartoon of Itchy and Scratchy ruined by the inexplicable and illogical ("Should I believe this is some kind of ... * snort * ... magic xylophone?"), so you're very literal and moodless for this movie. You're renting a Sandler movie instead. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
