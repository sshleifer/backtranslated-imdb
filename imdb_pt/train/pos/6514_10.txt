I thought the kids in the series did a great job. I especially enjoyed the performance of the character Emma. Well done! The acrobatics were great for a low budget show. I was able to watch the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes. I liked the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of it. The ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released were also good. Another good point of the film is that it kept moving. There were not many slow scenes. Adult leaders were also credible and therefore helped keep the program entertaining. All in all a nice night of watching movies.
