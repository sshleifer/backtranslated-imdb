"The Shooter" was a different kind of movie for Michael Dudikoff. Although usually associated with action moves that incorporate martial arts, this film, being a western, allowed him to demonstrate that he is a much more capable actor than certain story lines of formulas allowed. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that the movie does not allow for any solid character development. The fleshing is really left to the viewer. We can only imagine the sadness that made the Shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the killer he is - a killer, remember, that a little town, terrified by a local bully, welcomes like a hero that can release of his misery.
