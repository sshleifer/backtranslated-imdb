Tip Number One - Read the title as "Crazy Dog Time", or maybe puppies. This is a good set (look at the cast and hire it - you already know you're curious), and director Bishop for the first time gives them their chance, seizing the time, letting the characters interact and chewing the scene . wait - not with enthusiasm - for the return of the "great boss" and any revenge that follows. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight is to see Christopher Jones after his self-imposed exile of the movies; it remains a dominant presence in cinema. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, this is the "Wild in the Streets" reunion party!
