First of all the film, it is an ingenious piece of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a little boy pretends to be an adult inherits a million dollars and how he spends. I mean, how crazy that is. Walt Disney really got over this time. Comedy is most often expected, but at other times unexpected. I mean, was this movie good or was that movie okay? He also teaches a lot about young wise men and I this kid is really wise and a little time smart pants. But it sucks too. How the hell could a guy like that kid have a hot baby cop and his dad let him go free. It's like letting a murderer be freed for ten years. If I did, I would be beaten with a 'subleixo' (a huge stick that stings when used to hit his asses very hard). That kid is really lucky. Back to history. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made this film, but it's still not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The boy and the woman had neither chemistry nor the father, but the hands were excellent. " The special effects, on the other hand, were lame. Also, this movie is not based on reality. I hated and loved at the same time.
