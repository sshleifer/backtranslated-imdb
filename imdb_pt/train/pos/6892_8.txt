The closest I got to seeing this was a clip shown at an exhibition of Gerard Philippe in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in the remake and having just reached the original just over half a century after it was done, I can only conclude that inept fencing was intentional, aimed at an obsolete target. Hollywood had been making realistic sword fights since the 1930s, when the greatest of all, Basil Rathbone, was crossing with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and that leaves only satire. After a while you do not notice and enjoy the dialogue of Henri Jeanson reminiscent of the Prisoner of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to play a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a little better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. The impression I saw was particularly bad and at one point it broke completely, so maybe a DVD version could improve it.
