Crush provides a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I think English lays very well when it comes to matters of the heart. Best known for directing John McKay wrote this wonderful script about three friends in their early forties in a small town in England. All three professional women who have lost their luck with men have formed a ritual night of girls reunited with gin, cigarettes and sweets, including endless conversations about the misconduct of the dates or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell, once again played in the vicinity of the British (which is where I think she most exudes) is absolutely charming as the director of a prestigious school that engages with a younger man. Small-town gossip and disapproving jealous friends (big supporting cast) conflict with her relationship. Unfold a series of brutal unhappy events and show us the many difficulties when one is in search of true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film are the friendships and the end shows us just that. This is the kind of movie you love or hate, and that's why I believe in several mix reviews and not the biggest hit you had when this movie was released. As I'm sure, most are digging up the movie now. I really liked this movie and recommend it to those who like movies like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a Funeral". Not to mention that the soundtrack is extraordinary capturing perfectly these crucial moments.
