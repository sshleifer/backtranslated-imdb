In The Barbarian and the Geisha, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a true envoy from the United States who was responsible for actually opening Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry basically pushed Japan with gunboats and forced a treaty to the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived a little later, worked through the details and helped to ensure compliance - since many Japanese felt no particular inclination to do so. honor the first treaty. All of this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources I've found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this novel is very much the focus of this film (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction the first time I saw this movie was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat? When he's being a diplomat in most movies, he says please and thank you as he attacks people !!!! So seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed really very strange. In fact, I can not think of many actors in 1958 who would be more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen photos of Harris and Wayne pretty much bears no resemblance to him at all. <br /> <br /> However, despite the story taking a lot of freedoms with the truth and the odd cast, the film is still very watchable. Color cinematography is good, the film shows some good insights into Japanese customs and culture and acting is not bad. All in all, a nice and watchable film, despite being a strange cast. <br /> PS - Read the trivia of this movie. You discover a bit more about the real-life characters as well as about a supposed fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston), where Wayne apparently knocked him down !! Based on what I read about Huston and the way he dealt with the actors, this is an incident I believe in. And it is also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomacy."
