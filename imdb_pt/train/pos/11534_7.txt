Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / cooler from 1990, released here in the UK on the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It's a desert-based horror movie about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed one by one by an unknown force driving a menacing black truck !!! This movie has some scary scenes, and some gore here and there, but I have to say that acting was so lame, even at low budget standards! But the movie was strangely addictive and I enjoyed it, and I never fell asleep or hung up, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but seeing as he built the steam along the way, had some good moments of gore and suspense, had a good nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too ! I'll give 7/10.
