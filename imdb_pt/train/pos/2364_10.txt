I must confess I did not read the original story of MCR James, although I read many of his other supernatural tales. I've also seen most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghosts Stories and this, in my opinion, beats most of them, just matching The Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can not blame The View From the Hill - the direction and the humor are perfect, as well as acting, lighting and, of course, history and writing. I really enjoyed it and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC plans to do a little more (not necessarily based on MR James stories), so this is promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
