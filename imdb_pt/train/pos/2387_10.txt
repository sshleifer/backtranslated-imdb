I have a six month old baby at home and every once in a while she fights very well. One morning she was having a hard time getting to sleep when the theme song of the doodle bops came on TV. She stopped crying almost instantly, and for the rest of the show she was pleased. I sat her on her bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms and really laugh at this show. He kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also have a video of them so that sometimes when my little girl is nervous, I have something to calm her down. Granted, late at night if she wakes up with colic to stir the scribbles of the doodle is not her cup of tea but they certainly come in handy when I need a little time to do housework etc. The biggest surprise about the doodle bops is that my son does not even like to watch TV. She preferred to be on the floor playing with a toy or with our little toy poodle than watching the TV yet, the doodle bops totally captured her attention. I do not know if she will continue to like them in the future, but for now she is connected.
