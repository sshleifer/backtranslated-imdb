Enchanting drama of four men on a weekend of canoeing on a remote river. They are the pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), the adventurous and violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), the nasty Bobby (Ned Beatty) and the nice Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - there's the incredible sequence of dueling banjos, interesting interaction between the characters and just a stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two horsemen attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Simply unbelievable. The scenery is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence is occurring. To be honest, Beatty's rape never bothered me - I'm very aware that it's being faked despite good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change - Ed has his pacifism tested, Lewis gets weak, Bobby is raped by one of the people he has mocked earlier and Drew tries to stay sane. The direction of John Boorman is also very guaranteed and the sounds of the forest and the river immensely help the mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Voight is well on the lead - he's better. Beatty is also just OK - but it's his debut movie and he has the guts to take such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is simply superb - one of his best acting jobs! As this was not even nominated for an Oscar escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are as believable as the country boys. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for kids. Try to see an uncut version - the TV version is down. Also viewing mailboxes is essential for capturing the breathtaking images.
