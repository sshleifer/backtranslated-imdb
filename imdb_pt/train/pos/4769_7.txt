I'm sure this is a show that no one is familiar with and who may not think well of it; after all, is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the location, the style of the direction and its publicity? shows women walking on the beach and everything. No wonder people have a misconception and decide not to watch it. <br /> <br /> It was wrong of them to do this. Because after I decided to attend the show, there are really more things going on, a really succulent story and conflict that end up being really exciting to watch and very well ?? addictive. <br /> <br /> The history of the hotel staff, the manager, the owner and his complicated love life. Also enter the hotel visitor and the powerful man trying to steal the hotel. It's really more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that acting sucks, but it's not so bad that you look away. The story is not so consistent, but good enough. The soundtrack is fitting very well with the scenery and the action is all the time. I've taken a few episodes before something really happens, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really like to see this. Zillion times better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my comment after reading, thank you.
