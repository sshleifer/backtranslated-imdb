Despite its somewhat obsessed title, this is a light teen drama. Unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it enjoyable. It is not so good to develop characters or situations without problems, however. When you see it, you have the feeling of running around in the kitchen, even if you've been sitting around watching it all the time. This is one of those movies that relies a lot on your character tastes, and they are attractive enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many, I know, but I've always liked the obscure Maddie Corman. Teenagers spend most of their time on screen without much intrusion on those pesky adults. Is it just me or the majority of young males is very similar?
