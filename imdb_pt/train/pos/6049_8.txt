Freebird is the perfect marriage between the comedy road trip, the gangerer, the movie "stoner" and the British cinema. <br /> <br /> They are the brilliant protagonists that distinguish this film from other films of this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters extremely friendly and realistic. The main story revolves around his journey from London to Wales and the adventures and setbacks that occur along the way. This little movie also has a big heart - it's not just for motorcycle fans as it is based on character relationships with each other, including dreams and regrets, like Gary Stretch's Fred, wishing the family he left behind. Cinematography is also great - a love letter for the Welsh countryside, as well as capturing the harshness of London streets and typical pub life in rural Welsh towns. <br /> <br /> Elegant, stylish soundtrack, friendly characters and funny storyline - I would recommend Freebird in a snap!
