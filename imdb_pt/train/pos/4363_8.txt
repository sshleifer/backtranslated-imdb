It's a bit disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this movie is where Gig earned his name and also a good career boost after playing small pieces under another name. <br /> <br /> I will counter most of the other comments and say that I really enjoyed this movie, mainly because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, affectionate and resolute as the eldest of the three daughters, whose mother died in the Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during the War of the Spoils I. As the " man "of the house, Fiona stood for years against the settlement of her father's will, which would allow a type of Donald Trump named Charles Barclay to get the family home. But Fiona is keeping a secret of why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the average and seductive sister who is married to an English but wants her younger sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you are Stanwyck's fan, this is not a fault.
