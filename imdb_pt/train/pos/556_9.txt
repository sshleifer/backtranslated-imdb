Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their flock from Seattle to Alaska and to Canada to make a complaint. Once there, they have to deal with the seductive and seductive businesswoman Ruth Roman and the unhappy and unfortunate villain, James McIntire. <br /> <br /> John Wayne can talk about more, but his good friend Stewart has done some excellent westerns and too hard, some with the great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I would take it, with its sturdy action sequences and excellent melodrama, from North to Alaska, any day! <br /> <br /> The Far Country features some breathtaking landscapes and cinematography that should definitely have been filmed in widescreen. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is strong support from the always dependable Brennan, Roman (who is great), the incredibly cute Corrine Calvet, and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of villain, the kind who do not take yourself too seriously. <br /> <br /> That would give a great double bill with another highly recommended Western Mann / Stewart in the northwest, Bend Of The River.
