I watched FIDO on some movie channel and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The movie looks like a comic that perfectly captures the surreal 50's look, you know the healthy decade when they danced for Elvis as they dropped nukes in the desert just for his hell. People were so na√Øve at that time that it was scary and the idea that clean people find it normal to have zombies as pets really works here. <br /> <br /> Kudos to this Canadian production, the excellent color and crisp cinematography cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the boy. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie has not been a big hit. He deserved more recognition. It is much better than the material of Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh well. It's an instant classic, though.
