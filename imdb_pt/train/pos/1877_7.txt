Arthur Bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multimillionaire and is attracted to people 'beneath him' in social standing - he pays for a prostitute in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a store thief. <br /> <br /> He drinks a lot too, and sometimes he's driving while drinking, too, which obviously is not funny, ever. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, but behind the comedy is some reality too. John Gielgud cleans the floor with everyone on the screen and creates a character for ages. Talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but their Gielgud as "Hobson" you will remember more.
