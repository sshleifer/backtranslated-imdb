I saw this in the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with mustard gas on the yellow cross for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hull) in frightening protective suits. The experienced British soldiers wear gas masks (only) and wait for the clouds of gas and the German attackers again. The gas clouds are coming closer and closer, finally involving the British defenders. The Germans slowly creep in on their frightening appearance. Suddenly a shout from the defenders ... This gas is like no other they have experienced before ... <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver, I think that you will too!
