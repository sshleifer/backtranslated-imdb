GBS wrote his own adaptation for the screen of this Nobel Prize winning piece, but did not live to see it produced (he won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his PYGMALION game in 1914). When Otto Preminger set up (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noticed the British author Graham Greene making the adaptation and it was a solid choice. Taking a suggestion from Shaw's own script, Greene uses the Stage Epilogue material to create a framing device to merge the two acts of the play (one at the beginning and one later in Joan's story ) into a unified and more satisfying whole. Where on stage the change of tone is cushioned with a break, here it works equally well with the return to King KING's room Charles Balois (where the man Joan placed on the throne is dreaming of the events that led to his current situation), and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - the introduction of Warwick's shadow from John Gielgud (the English "creator king"). <br /> <br /> Most of the language is solid GBS, and the performances of the robust Shauvians (like Felix Inquisitor of Aymler or Harry Andrews of Stogumber) for newcomers (the film established the career of Jean Seberg) are of the first line. That may confuse some, just familiar with Richard Widmark's many movie villains, to see him playing a fragile and somewhat silly Dauphin, but the performance - strangely top-billed - is professional, even if it's arguably miscued. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white footage served Shaw well and history. Go in expectation of quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
