This is one of those rare films, it's beautiful and attractive, dignified and quirky, a real gift. I consider this a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any type of vacation, because it reminds you of opening yourself up to a wider experience (yes, find the magic). I particularly loved Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but every protagonist and supporting actor is flawless in this movie. In addition, the costumes, if you are attracted to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well made. I just wanted them to be released on DVD because I'm using my tape version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, just make sure you settle in to watch it without interruption.
