Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God has given all people the ability to love the whole world, but since a human heart is very small in size, every human being has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of today's most eminent directors when they set out to profess eternal love for this special place and portray situations in the lives of their inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through the Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, expectations. <br /> Always some other room, always some moving story about ordinary people in search of love, whether in a parking lot, art studio, subway station. And Paris je t'aime is about a wide range of loves - love for the partner, son, father, for those who mean the world to us, but are no longer around, love that needs to be rekindled, love for that stranger when his eyes meet Or love that just is not meant to be ... today, but tomorrow, who knows? <br /> <br /> However, this film is not only about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not at all mellow, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories could develop even more, but not all of them and this is what I think is missing, and by "further development" I do not want to say any specific reference to the future of the characters. As far as everything else is concerned, I can only say - captivating. It makes you want to leave everything behind, run away to Paris and live those little novels alone.
