This is a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many different performances in this. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a delight, bringing comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villain" in the film, and its oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delicious as the title store owner, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar way is well used here. I especially enjoyed the performance of Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. Very convincing in every facet of your role. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an excellent job portraying a woman desperate, neurotic, but charming and attractive. <br /> This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action spinning around him. Stewart is more up to the task of carrying the film, with an incredible performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he gets fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, the anger, the fear and the embarrassment that such a traumatic event causes, so perfectly. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest movie actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else who has ever been captured in a movie that is able to convey so completely what it is feeling to the public. By the time he made this film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, but he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest and funniest romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
