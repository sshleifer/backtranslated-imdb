Princess Tam Tam does not have the pitfalls of racism, the way we think about racism in the United States, but there are more subtle claims (to the American observer) about ethnic identity over time. Pay attention to Alwina's positioning in scenes, as she is approached by the other characters, the settings around her that all describe her as a "wild" African, and ask herself whether Alwina has any fragment of agency during the movie. I do not want to ruin anything, but in the end pay close attention, the dichotomy between "Eastern" and "Western" culture is to say the least offensive, such diction is gravely denied these days. The French have a contagious past as an imperial force in all areas represented (see Les Statues Meurent Aussi 1953 by Chris Marker), and pay attention to the places European travelers visit while in Africa, and what this reflects on their attitudes ? toward the "other." I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker, much of what she did in her professional career, as Tam Tam Princes, who is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration, her work as a spy. jorrando, sorry.) However, the film for me is captivating because of its performance, plus it is a relic revealing past mentalities.
