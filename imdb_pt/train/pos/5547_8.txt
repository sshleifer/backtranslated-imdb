Strangler of the Swamp was made by the PRC low budget studio and is certainly one of his best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder he did not commit returns as a ghost to take revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man operating the ferry on the other side of the swamp, he disappears. The old man's granddaughter takes the ferry by herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has many nebulous environments, which makes it very scary too. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as the Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Great. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
