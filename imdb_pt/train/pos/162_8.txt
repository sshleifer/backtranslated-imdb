For a "no-budget" movie, this thing is too much. I do not know if America will like it, but we were laughing all the way. Some funny funny things. Really not-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Actors and music rocked. The cars and jokes and even the least in their face stuff cracked us. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the actors before, but never in something like that, one or two of them I think I saw in commercials or something somewhere. Basically, it rocked! Luckily, I was able to see a copy of a friend of one of the actors.
