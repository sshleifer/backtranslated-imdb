This film captures the essence of growing up in the small American city for a girl alone. The subtle realism and nuances offered to the character of Ashley Judd and Ruby in the plot captures what can only be described as a true setting for life in the Florida panhandle. From the beating of a screen door to the lack of work, the echoes of how life really is on the "red riviera" provide difficult choices for the young woman. The paradise was not easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceptions, and learns to be her own woman, with a force flowing from within. The victorious smile of Ashley Judd and the contagious march exude warmth and demand respect and admiration. The careful pace of character development resembles that of "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, starring Peter Fonda, and also directed by Victor Nunez.
