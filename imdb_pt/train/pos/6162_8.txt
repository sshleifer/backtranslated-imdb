I loved this masterpiece and, frankly, I also found Mary Poppins (despite loving Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be silly and sacrificial. Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I do not know why people find this film distorted. It was magical and it was a lot of fun to watch. Each scene had a certain charm when you first met the characters. You really see how this little united family learns to unite, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles, who was at the "not believing age". Mary Poppins may be more popular and loved by others, but this little gem will be the one I will always love and love.
