This movie is a cold, bare truth. Often we think "oh no, it will not happen to me". But this can happen. Drug smuggling is a big money and often people are unconsciously (or cheated) into doing things to smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, just wanted an exotic holiday - it turned into a nightmare. People need to know that this type of event is not improbable or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly enjoy this event. movie. It is very emotional and raw. It is worth watching and it certainly stays in your memory.
