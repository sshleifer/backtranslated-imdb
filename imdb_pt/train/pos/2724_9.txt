Many of the classic films of the late 1960s did not retain the ability to disrupt and confront audiences. "In Cold Blood" did not lose an ounce of its power. Its exceptionally well done still forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only of the film, but of Truman Capote's "nonfiction novel," that the central message is anything but subtle. That may be true, but this is definitely a case where lack of ambiguity does not detract from the movie. It is refreshing, especially considering the simplistic and manipulative moral dramas of today, to watch a film with a convinced political voice, without fear of forcing the public to consider their point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the central message of the film, but I admire its audacity anyway. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the message of punishment against the capital, there is much to admire. the film. The performance of both tracks is great. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors of all time) is scary as the nihilist leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also scary as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but is afraid to go against Wilson (there is a fair amount of homoerotic subtext on the part of his character). The cinematography is great, elegant but bold and really giving the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic Quincey Jones score and you'll get a masterpiece. (9/10)
