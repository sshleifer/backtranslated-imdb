Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of the latest Spanish cinema (just take a look at your curriculum vitae), so I did not expect much from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... Actually I do not know why in the world I decided to watch it. Anyway, I just did ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira has finally matured and is now able to make a good movie. It's the latest work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointing and the pursuit of a second chance after you've ruined everything. The last half hour of the movie (the most dramatic) is the best part, and it's worth watching the movie. We also have Eduard Fernandez in the lead role, and I still think he's the best actor of his generation (by far). <br /> <br /> * My price: 7/10
