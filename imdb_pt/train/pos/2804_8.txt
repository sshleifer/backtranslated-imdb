The title of this movie almost stopped me from watching. Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit off putting, however I put my prejudices behind and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting much from a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie ran along with me never looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you liked East is East then you will love this movie. OK, so the plot is nothing new, and the classic stories are contained in the movie, but everything is very funny, and with a breath of fresh air. The film moves very fast and keeps the listening entertained. The funny moments are a good laugh and not an attempt at humor, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
