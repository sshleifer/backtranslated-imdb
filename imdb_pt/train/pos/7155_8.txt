More than just a "children's movie", "Holes" shows how the incidents of the past still affect us today whether we know about them or not. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers several things about the camp and his personal connection to it. Through flashbacks, we learned that several things are closer than we think (you'll understand this better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a good job, as do the other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting film.
