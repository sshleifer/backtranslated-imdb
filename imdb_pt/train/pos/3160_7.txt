This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's set in the 70's. That's the only difference he has with other TV comedies. I do not know how you can like this show. Your mood is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so straightforward ... A typical dialogue is this: "Did: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you." (The audience laughs) Jackie: Did you're a pervert. : Oh, yes, I am (the audience applauds and applauds) "That's not funny. I guess if I did not have those laughs (I do not know what you call it in English, sorry) you would not laugh at all. This is not clever comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but that's not good. I would give 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again).
