What an incredibly funny and original show. The cast starting with the hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) is simply perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN) I laughed more during this show than any I have ever (including Newhart, one of my all-time favorite shows) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you'll love this series! Williams in her coat The photo is from Cindy Williams doing an unspeakable act with a bowling pin upside down It's amazing to see an actress like Cindy Williams being able to interpret herself like this. I just hope this will be released on DVD with special bonus many special features.Functions funniest I've ever seen !!!!
