I was not expecting the powerful cinematic experience of "Girlfight". He's an indie; low budget, no famous actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good but not so good. <br /> <br /> Nestled in a contemporary and ethnic working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-to-day struggles of urban life. Latinos Diana, the protagonist, is boiling with rage and attacks her schoolmates, getting into trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a strict double standard based on sex in her children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing classes at the local academy, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On a mission to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana switch places; he gets his dad's money and tells Diana to give the lessons in his place. <br /> <br /> This is actually a well-being film, as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and tackles some very serious head-on problems. There is no giggly, 'all that can go well goes' resolution to the 'Bend It Like Beckham'. The reality and personal issues that go with it are too big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying movie for her.
