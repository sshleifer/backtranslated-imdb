This film has captured my heart from the start, by hearing the first notes of Quincy Jones or seeing the wonderful purple color of the flowers in the meadows. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! The whole cast gives the best performance in a movie I've seen in years and Spielberg really excelled! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh lord!), Danny Glover and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg is Celie, she gives her that insecurity and sense of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow up with her, we grow strong along with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she is most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" actually "have souls too." The always friendly and charming Danny Glover does a wonderful job of making people hate him and the magnificent music of (I would say, sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful and emotional film a life experience. You do not want to miss it! "Sista '... remember my name ..."
