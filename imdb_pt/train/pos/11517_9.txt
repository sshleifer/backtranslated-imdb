If you like Cleese and all the British 'Pythonesque' mood of the time, then this little gem is absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real treat! <br /> <br /> I saw this with friends on TV when it first came out, and their classic quotes have been a part of our jokes for 30 years, and they will do forever! I have this on tape and it is continually appreciated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some critics are taking this very seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that it's now only available in the US (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of the British humor story !!
