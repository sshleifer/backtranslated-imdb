One more snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged biopic, this fun and fabulous movie has the look and feel of the time with an excellent soundtrack and everything you'd like in an indie movie. I think the trend would be to portray Bettie Page as a sort of sexual bullshit, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked closely at Bettie's poses, she always seemed happy. Not a "would you like to be with me" look arrogant, nor the "I'm just doing it because my acting career did not work" look at a porn star. And so the women involved in this film (three female producers, a writer / director, co-writer, and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who I'm sure helped shape this role with their own sugary influence) really captured the idea of ​​a sweet , a rather naive, southern girl who really liked having her photo taken and hoped the good old JC would not be too upset about her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol ends up having a high-performance career (she may have the most perfect breasts of all time), which makes me happy because she had the curse. Several years ago, she did the Vanity Fair cover when no one really knew who she was, releasing her as the next It-girl. And let's face it, that was a bit presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately, she never reached Gwyneth status, though not for lack of talent. Making a few poor movie choices when you are a beautiful blonde in fickle Hollywood makes it forgetful that I'm scared. If that does not put her back on list A, well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> Intensely private, Bettie herself has not yet seen the movie. Bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever floats your boat, my dear. You were an infernal woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mary Harron, you did justice to our worship idol.
