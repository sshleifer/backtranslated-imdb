I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club. It was the last year of the wild 60 years and this movie really came home. It has everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success and the conflict between following the "traditions" of the family to those who seek their lives. <br /> <br /> It was a fast and very enjoyable film. . Vegas was at its hottest peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous participations, laughter, conflicts, romance and even a happy ending. A very pleasant moment. <br /> <br /> The poster of this movie is on the wall of my room. I look at this and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my moments with my father, a great moment of my life.
