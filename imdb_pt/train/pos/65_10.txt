This film is not just about a school shootout, in fact it has never been seen. But that only increases the power that this movie has. It's about the people and how they deal with the tragedy. I know it was shown to the students who survived the Columbine shooting and this provided a sense of closure for many of them. The acting is superb. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about it after seeing it. It provokes the discussion not only of school shootings, but also of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a tear-jerker, but it's worth it and one I'll watch over and over again
