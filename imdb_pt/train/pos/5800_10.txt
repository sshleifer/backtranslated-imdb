THIS IS TOO MUCH MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE WORLD !!!!! I liked it when I was 4 and I still like 16 !! It is an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! I like every second of it and not only does the film have some great special effects, but also sends a great message to the young audience, which may sound similar to it, but in fact the movie is very COOLY indeed! Although Michael Jackson is in some movies now, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he's the most talented actor I know! He's so talented! He is incredible !!! MOONWALKER IS A MUST SEE !!!!!!
