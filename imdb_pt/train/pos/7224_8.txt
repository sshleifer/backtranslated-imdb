When DEATHTRAP was released for the first time, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - featured a graphic similar to the Rubik's Cube. It's an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, author of memorable works such as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous tweets, and under the direction of Sidney Lumet translates very well to screen. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very difficult to discuss, for doing so in any detail reveals the very plot by which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mysterious pieces, but currently seems to have lost the touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, a former student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a screenplay for a play he has written. It is called "Deathtrap" and Sidney recognizes it as an infallible success. Just the kind of success that revive your career ... in fact, a success to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the play, the events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected way possible. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer's equally winding SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP really is a story more at home on the stage than the screen. - To achieve full power, you need the immediacy that a live performance offers. Still, under the guidance of director Sidney Lumet, he makes a more than respectable display onscreen. A lot of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably good. Michael Caine makes a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and captivating as Sidney's relentlessly anxious wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what may be the best performance in his sadly short acting career. If you can not see it in a first-rate theatrical production, this will be more than enough until one comes along. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer.
