I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 at the site of the noon movie. After many subsequent views (and video purchase), it still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a relic of another era - a domestic comedy set in the rich American middle class - but well executed is well executed. But it is also a document of his time - a celebration of postwar optimism, the baby boom, and the rising consumer age. This movie is not a "guilty pleasure". <br /> <br /> Three wonderful and sophisticated protagonists - Urban Melvyn Douglas; Cary Grant confused; Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "That means we have to explode" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "That little pig." <br /> <br /> I love it.
