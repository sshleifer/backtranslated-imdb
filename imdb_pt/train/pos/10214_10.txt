For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies with no idea what's going to happen, so therefore, I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The actual translation, "The beating of butterfly wings", strangely is not used as the translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans would not know what Chaos Theory is (except those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on chaos theory, and how a small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events that lead to an event. The film is a whirlwind of wonderful cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it interweaves itself between various characters (about 20?). In a way, the ending seems inevitable, though, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think for yourself "what else needed to be said"? It is both a very brave ending. Too bad we have to go abroad for a gem like this, but an ending like this would never come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
