The genius of Pure Orson Welles makes this one of the greatest films. Welles is dragged into a murder conspiracy just to be raised as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic commentary "Big Dummy I Am". The plot is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The scene of the shooting in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most incredible ever filmed. This scene alone is worth the price of admission. This is the only time Rita Hayworth ever played a complex but believable character. No one but Welles would have the nerve to cut his hair and dye his matted blond. No one should miss this photo.
