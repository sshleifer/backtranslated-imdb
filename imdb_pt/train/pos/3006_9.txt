Although a 9 might seem an extraordinarily high score for such a small movie, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of detective films of the 1930s and 40s, this is one of the best and also compares very favorably with the movie "Thin "by Powell. Man "movies.Now this does NOT mean that the movie is similar to Thin Man movies, since it is not a comedy but more a traditional mystery detective movie.Now you would think that not having Nora Charles or Asta or a Traditional comic book helper (something found in virtually every detective film in the series) over for fun would be a detriment, but I did not miss them because this was so exceptionally well-written film - taking a genuinely interesting case as well as performances uniformly excellent of all. <br /> <br /> The film begins at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although this Philo Vance film actually spends little of the time on the show dogs and dogs are not one a completely hated man is killed and left in a completely closed room - an idea repeated in many other detective films (such as THE STRANGER CASE OF THE DOCTOR However, as all this is explained it seems quite credible and they fit in very well - keeping all my interest. I sure would like other detective movies of the day to have cleverly written plots and exceptional acting like that. This is definitely a keeper.
