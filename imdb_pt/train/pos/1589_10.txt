I love this show. I watch all the reruns every day, although I have seen them all as 6 times each. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. York. Holly goes to live with Val when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment in the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems that Vall and Holly go through. The main problem is personal, but it is also about being responsible and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 years old and is a totally free spirit, while Val is the complete opposite. She is the organized has to have a plan to make any kind of person. <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
