If you are researching facts about UFOs, this video is very important. The 'meat' of the video are the comments made by Buzz Aldrin. He is without a doubt the best of America. Trained to be objective, honest and factual in your reports. Many American astronauts of all ages have reported some kind of contact, or UFO observance, and there are videos of some of these missions. At the very least, something happened that requires more objective investigations in progress. I think this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds might be interested in our progress. Like any supposedly documentary video, this may be biased but contains additional information and opinions from an American hero. Those do not show up every day. Therefore, the fact that some people are not interested in details should not divert their attention from viewing this video. If nothing else, it is interesting and I recommend you watch with an open mind.
