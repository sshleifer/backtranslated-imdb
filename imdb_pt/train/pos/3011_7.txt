One of Vance's best films succeeds most in interesting plot and ingenious direction by none other than Michael Curtiz. This time, a generally hated financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked room and locked upstairs. Philo Vance, on learning of the situation, about to leave for Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks a murder is and what everyone is considering as a suicide. William Powell is a Philo Vance as affable as you will find. He never seems to press and is always very good at what he says and does. Powell is helped by a number of very talented actors - some top-notch actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as secretary of the dead, Paul Cavanaugh as a hunter of rivals, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as the next door, still blonde, and two very good performances of James Lee as the Chinese cook and corpulent Eugene Palette as a police detective. Add to the mix a wonderfully comedic turn of Etienne Girardot as a public coroner, always missing his meal. It's this depth of suspects and a story that has many twists and turns that make mystery a fast and fun mystery.
