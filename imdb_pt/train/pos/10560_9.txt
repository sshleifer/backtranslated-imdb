Jimmy Cagney is constantly eyeing this story of a theater producer struggling vigorously against the upcoming "spoken" movies. <br /> <br /> This story of love, fraud, women and dance is presented in such a way. way that as a spectator, you are never treated for a moment of boredom. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was extremely well done. History has never been lost at this frantic pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have become somewhat outdated, but that does not matter, because when you look at it in a 1933 timeframe, it's fabulous to watch this alongside many other films that were released during this time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this movie, never losing his composure as ever. producing producer of previews made for theaters as intros. In this way, he tries to save his butt from getting out of business, he was a broadway producer before starting this. Joan Blondell is fabulous as neglected love interest, Nan, she does such a witty performance that is so unusual for movies of the time, so cool to see a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the huge productions at the end. These were magnificent in themselves, beautifully choreographed and beautifully produced, but they just did not seem to fit the story. The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to do 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls were rehearsing throughout the film and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. In this way, the "Sitting in a fence around" was much more appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end seemed to drag this story frantically interrupted and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then realized that there were two others coming. These sequences laughed a lot of the audience as well. <br /> <br /> In short, a great movie with a sour end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
