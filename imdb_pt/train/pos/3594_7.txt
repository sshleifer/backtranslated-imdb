Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You could say she was a tough woman. With this film, she not only proved her acting, but shows no fear and is as hard as she should be in this movie. She's another bad girl and that's what I like about her. This movie is about a troublesome girl, living life like a boy of tone and getting in trouble with school and family. As she becomes interested in her siblings training to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her sibling coach to train her. Even if they do not think it has the potential, they may show that they are wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a little slow in the end, but it was well done. This shows that people can do anything, even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend that you be seen.
