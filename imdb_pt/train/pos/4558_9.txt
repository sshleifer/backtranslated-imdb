MY LEFT FOOT, in my opinion, is a great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were incredible, the soundtrack was great, and the cast was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he was saying most of the time. Also, when he threw a tantrum, I was a bit scared. Moreover, it is so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, whether you're a diehard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or as biopics, I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. You are in for a real treat and a good time, so do not miss this one.
