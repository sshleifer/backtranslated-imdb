This film is a great example of good storytelling. The acting is superb. The story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or false. There were some points where they probably made people a little more good or bad than they actually were, but considering it's a Hollywood movie, they showed incredible restraint. There was not a single explosion shown in the film, even if they had an opportunity for it. The film, despite having parts of suspense, was not turned into action movie. The story is made to focus on an extraordinary man in sadly normal times. Well done!
