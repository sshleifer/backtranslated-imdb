When I read another review, I decided to watch this movie ... First, especially cast Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough ... <br /> <br /> Film, a lot of intelligence and interesting because, the cast has a lot of actors and actresses especially European, like from Turkey and Russia ... <br /> < > Second, The story is basic and you can guess, but if you like interesting action, you will like it in my opinion ... Third, the Final Chapter is not special or interesting, is regular as in other action movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you enjoy: D
