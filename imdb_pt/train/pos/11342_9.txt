I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 years old. It was right after Bay City Rollers. I came to the Family Channel one day and recorded it for my three-year-old daughter. I had forgotten all the things I loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, the makeup of Witcheepoo. <br /> <br /> This show is decidedly low-tech. The mayor is certainly a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with angry eyes. But children love these things. They would rather watch a guy working on a sock puppet than sit in front of a high-tech computer animation. There is a slap (soft), but there are no adult themes like sex or dying people, and children accept Jimmy's schemes. The kids thought it would be cool to carry a bag of smoke and convince someone that their house was on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky, she thought Witchypoo was flying over the city. The music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. She used to sing "different is difficult, different is solitary" in the car. My daughter attended this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and is still a favorite of her. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in progress. I really hope they try to keep the old flavor and do nothing like characters that animate computers, etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
