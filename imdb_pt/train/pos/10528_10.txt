I was so impressed with Doug McGrath's film version of Jane Austen's novel "Emma," and I loved Rachel Portman's score so much that when I went to the video store one day and found out that the two had gathered for "Nicholas Nickleby" I rented it immediately without any other consideration. <br /> <br /> I read the book, and for those overly critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation, I do not know what else McGrath could have done. to capture with more perfection the spirit and main elements of the plot of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two-hour film (which some have complained about being too long!). And as for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I must confess that I was not very familiar with her when I first saw her in the theater, and I was absolutely convinced she was an English actress! <br /> <I am amazed at those who criticized the film for its lush landscape. This is one of the things I like and hope to see in period pieces in the interior of England. The beautiful origins of the film are one of the main contributors to its appeal and success. If your idea of ​​escapist is something darker, then maybe you should rent something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The country's English settings are as appealing and charming as the cast and match the story and soundtrack to entertainment that keeps you from getting tired of repeated views. McGrath is a marvel at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie can also be a clinic on how a movie can be fun. less sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist. The story is often fun, captivating and sometimes quite touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many competent adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is undoubtedly my favorite.
