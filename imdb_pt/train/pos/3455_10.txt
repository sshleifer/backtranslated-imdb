Steven Spielberg (aged 24) had directed two excellent episodes of a 1971 series called "The Psychiatrist," starring Roy Thinnes. One episode was about a 12 year old boy with emotional problems and the other about a vibrant young man (Clu Gulager in his best performance) who is dying of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually unlike anything else on TV, and emotionally complex and adult. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced their first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on first-rate TV directors, experienced for the first season of "Columbo" such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after watching part of Clu Gulagher's episode of "The Psychiatrist." Spielberg says on the "Duel" DVD that he loved Steven Bochco's "Murder by the Book" script (based on a Levinson / Link story), and he tried to make the production look like a million-dollar resource, even if he had a lot less money to work with. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Columbo" is far more visually elegant and makes better use of the soundtrack and background music than any other "Columbus" episode, even though the series has always used high-profile directors level. Spielberg manages to prevent the big Falk and Cassidy from bothering him too much, but both actors are still a lot of fun. Spielberg also gets a good supporting job from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have a freshness and vitality on them. The only episode of "Columbo" that was close to being well directed is the episode "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg did not develop technically so much as a director. <br /> <br /> He was great from the start. Robert Altman says that the episode was practically as good as that of a director. Perhaps the same is true of Spielberg.
