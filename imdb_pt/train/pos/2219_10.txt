This movie was a fascinating look at culture and society creoles that few African Americans are aware of. My two sons are derived from a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black-skinned woman whose parents were former slaves. He married off and against his culture and was cut off from all his family, except for a sister who took pity on the situation of his brothers; raise 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; providing the family with food whenever they could. Of course she clandestinely helped this family, fearing for their own communication. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We were part of our library.
