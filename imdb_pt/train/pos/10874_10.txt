I must admit, I was expecting something quite different from my first showing of 'Cut' last night, although I was charmed by the unexpected gem of Australian horror. I'm a true horror fan as true as they come, and I found 'Cut' not just the best of the genre that Australia has ever produced but also one of the great comedy / spoof movies. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the mainstream audience does not notice many comic elements - the film was not very clever in its application, but it made me laugh every moment trying to fit in ALL the possible cliches of the horror genre that they could. I'm sure this was meant as humor ... hoping it was intentional. Of course, there was blood. <br /> <br /> The use of the 'personalized gardening scissors' was brilliant - in addition to the blows and blows expected. In short, there was enormous variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this film. The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short as her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just one more reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic as were Simon Bossell ('The Castle'), in a brilliant role as the playful coach. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last two years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-cheek to the end. <br /> <br /> I loved it. Go and see!
