This is a very somber and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious assassinations. The plot revolves around a demented man who lives in Texas, USA, who suddenly goes on a killing with his two young children after being instructed by God to redeem the world from bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton who directs this movie plays the troubled father who is known as the murderer of God's hand while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performances to date as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer handle the burden of his murderous childhood and uses flashbacks to haunt the story for FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can not think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their place from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to do it because of the absolute power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors filmed this movie very well, and they helped to define the plot through the good scenario. . The acting in this movie is great but if there is any downside it is that some parts are very powerful and can disturb some people. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this film is very obscure, young children help portray the idea through brilliant acting. This is really a backbone film and it is guaranteed that you have the edge of your seat throughout. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, disturbing and powerful or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
