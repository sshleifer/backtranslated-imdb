I watched this as a recent TV movie last night, by chance. The synopsis of the movie said something about the fact that the mother was staying with her daughter and going on a romantic journey because I had attuned to the fact that the carpenter was working hard in a new conservatory - not even interpreted by Daniel Craig - so the plot was immediately apparent . <br /> <br /> It turns out that the love interest of the eponymous mother is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there are problems to prepare and there are many surprises. But I got caught up in the convincing performance of Anne Reid and I got hooked. The steering gives you plenty of room to look in mirrors and adjust handkerchiefs when it exudes sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were fascinating and violated the taboos. Should not the bodies of the older women remain concealed? Not here and we are receiving a delicious resurgence of the mother's sexuality. Even more astounding are the drawings she made that (SPOILER!) Once discovered, confirm her daughter's suspicion that something is going on here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of the cast, but this could be me. With its pre-raph locks, I hoped to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have best suited the clashes in my mind. Bradshaw has a more cheerful face that does not carry the anger that comes as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> The ending is weak. If Mother's farewells when she is disgraced are so indifferent, perhaps we could see some closes of those who said goodbye and saw some of their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she is a recently mourned widow leaving for the lonely house she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of dissonant sympathy. For a movie so full of emotion (and be warned that it's like opening champagne, you'll never have the cover again), the ending is a cold contradiction.
