The movie belongs to the genus Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a bit of excitement to the story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with many well-represented side roles. <br /> <br /> Some have stated that this film is American classic. That's it and more. I agree with those who say "The film celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration". <br /> <br /> The film is a nice reminder that achievement may have been born from common roots. <br /> <br />
