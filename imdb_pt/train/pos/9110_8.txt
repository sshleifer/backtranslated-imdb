Do you know? Our spirit is based on this revolution, it is sleeping ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... Until that happened on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of expression, but when we had it in the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese have lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of expression! This is all a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the film ... I think he has some mistakes in the acting of some characters, but the way I watch in Portuguese films is very good !! I like it very much!
