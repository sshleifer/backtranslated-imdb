Much has already been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" movie and I thought that kind of description could have been a clich√©. But, like all cliches, it is based on truth. All trademarks of Miike are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, the taboo test and the difficulty of liking the central character. Shinjuku is, however, one of Miike's most perfect films. He says in an interview that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film has truly captivating energy and a raw edge that looks so fresh that while it can capture a film visually or technically more complex, it could not replicate or enhance the purity of that film. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is totally visceral, the gushing blood and the beatings are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair over her face. (Only a Miike movie could let you escape with a phrase like that). The film has a fantastic rhythm, unlike Dead or Alive, which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the post-war and this emotional subject is well treated here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing the praises of Shinjuku enough. I do not want to give too much. This is Miike before beginning to use CGI to liven up his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are superbly accomplished and the ultimate twist ensures that as soon as the movie is finished, you'll be back to putting it to work.
