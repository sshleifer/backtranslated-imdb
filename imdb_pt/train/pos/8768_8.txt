I saw this movie in a store in the cheap section. I really vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailers years ago. I thought "What the hey" and bought it, basically because the storyline sounded interesting and Claire Danes was always someone of talent in my eyes (this was also before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> So are two girls who go on vacation in Bangkok, are arrested for narcotics and are sent to a prison in Thailand. The film follows what will happen to them and sometimes questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film is unconventional, and raises some legal issues of discussion. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good solid movie, but there could have been some improvements. It could have been more ... it would have helped solidify these characters and more insights into the politics of the justice system of Thailand would have helped. <br /> <br /> However, in addition, it is a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all pop culture junkies are looking for a two-minute paper from Paul Walker. I did not even notice the first time I saw the movie.
