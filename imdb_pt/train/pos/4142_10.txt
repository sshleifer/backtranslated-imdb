The FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest, original and fun job I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie does not conform to Hollywood standards, -a-video fluff comedy movie starring terry "hulk" hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budgeting or any other thing. <br /> <br /> What this movie has, however, is very original and it's a nice story, and it's obviously made by people who love doing it, and the enthusiasm of the whole cast and crew really breaks through their budget and downtime. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that you do not need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what you are doing. <br /> <br /> simply the best movie of all time. I do not care how you can, rent, order, steal, download, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope they make a DVD version.
