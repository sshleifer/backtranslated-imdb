A serious comedy. The film version produced by Ross Hunter of the French play "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized as "A Very Rich Woman") is plush, well released, occasionally funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow, who seems to be wasting her money, is attacked by her two greedy, adult daughters, both fearing that Mama Rosie is carelessly spending her inheritance. The whole question of a vital - but elderly - woman sent to a nursing home against her will and then having to show up is in an audience, is a delicate material for a comedy (and to her credit, director David Lowell Rich does not overload the image with gross jokes or obvious feeling). Part of the humor is a little broad and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never reaches a fake note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has a lot to say about the importance of our seniors, and the ways in which they choose to spend the remaining time, that seriousness of the theme "Rosie!" Almost lost in a hurry for a happy ending. The photo makes you smile - and at the same time, imagine how many older ladies there have never been so lucky. *** in ****
