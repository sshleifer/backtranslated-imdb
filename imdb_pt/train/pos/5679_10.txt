After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that the Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time instead of the Tudor or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (nominated for the BAFTA Rowan Atkinson) is living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but adorable Baldrick (Tony Robinson), Blackadder is George's "faithful" butler, Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series, the beautifully written Blackadder sitcom tries everything it can to get rich and powerful. He tries to elect a gentleman to a rotten neighborhood, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a man on the road and finally poses as the Prince. This is a very good installment for the popular comedy. Includes appearances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. She won BAFTA for Best Comedy Series, and was nominated for Best Makeup and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 in The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 in Comedian Comedians, and he was number 8 in Britain's Favorite Comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on the 100 Greatest TV Characters, and he was the number 3 The biggest comedy characters in the world, and Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 in the best sitcom in Britain. Exceptional!
