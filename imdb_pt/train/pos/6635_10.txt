What can I say about the first movie of all time? <br /> <br /> You can not rate this because it's not supposed to be fun. But if you have to rate it, you should give it a 10. It is amazing to see the moving pictures of the year 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder what it was like to be one of the people who saw the first movie of all time! <br /> <br />
