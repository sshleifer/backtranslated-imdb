I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba does a great job at it. Michael Weatherly also does a great job, just like the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful stories and their acrobatics are incredible. It's like watching a 1-hour movie. Definitely worth watching.
