I'm obsessed! The story is incredible and the show is highly addictive, but I love it. I'm in the second season, disc 5, and I say that I'm very attached to the characters now. For anything bad happen to them it would seriously affect my vote for the show. And Michael is on my list now. Joking ... I am very happy to see that there is a third season, because I was very scared to go to disc 6 thinking it would be over. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / actors of Lost ... I like watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed on all the channels going to bed sad because of my disappointment with the television, but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
