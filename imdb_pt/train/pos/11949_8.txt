Woody Allen's second film is set in London. The killer of Tha Tarot Card is killing prostitutes in London. The aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a hint that he may be Sir Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins his novel, but quickly falls in love. She is aided by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who does not like what she sees. <br /> <br /> I like it more than last year's "Match Point". It was shorter and moved much faster. The plot is old, but I was entertained and this kept me guessing until the end. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comedy lines (all from Allen, of course). Not one of Allen's best, but it's much better than the worst. <br /> <br /> The acting is for the most part very good. Allen is bad, but he has played this character a million times before and it got tiresome. But Johansson and Jackman are great - they're fantastic and give two convincing performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) works on his sex appeal - there is a sequence in which both are in their bathing suits to show off their beautiful bodies. The only real debt is that Allen still seems insecure about how he shot London. He's not as far off as he was at "Match Point" - maybe it'll only get better as he goes along. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing. I give an 8.
