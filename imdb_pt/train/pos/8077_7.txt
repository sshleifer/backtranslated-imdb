A film made for the contemporary audience. The masses can see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sexy scenes as well. This is not exactly a movie that someone would feel comfortable watching with the whole family. Not for children's eyes. I had to advance a good number of scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just entertainment you're looking for, then this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. A prodigious production, I might add. <br /> <br /> However, the message of the film is not universal. He emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do good, you will be well. And if you do evil, you will have evil. The fruit of good works is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. While it is true that some bad people meet an evil end, there are many who escape. And then, there are many people who do good, and yet, in return, they are faced with a sad end. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the message, and all you want is an escape from mundane reality this movie is a great artist.
