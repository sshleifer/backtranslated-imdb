This is a great family loyalty story that fortunately does not resort to the usual tricks (or at least those I am accustomed to seeing in American and European films) of supersentimentality or dramatic high tension. <br /> It is very watchable and very kind. It has a beautiful cinematography, but it does not depend only on this to entertain.
