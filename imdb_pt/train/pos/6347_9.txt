As the Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from the first time I watched it. Now, eight views later, it still has the same impact on me than the first time I saw it. Writers Jeffery Price and Peter S. Roger Rabbit's Sailor of Fame do a fantastic job of adapting The Grinch story to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some movie detractors have argued that this is not true for the spirit or principles of the film. original story. After reading the original story, I must say I can not agree. The film makes exactly the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. It actually increases the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what it was. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * (They probably would not spoil the movie for you ... but if you have not seen it yet and are one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think almost everyone can relate to the Grinch's terrible experiences at school. I think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular of the school, who were always chosen. I know I was ... and that's why I personally had a lot of sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou, who is naive idealism, believing that no one can be at all bad, was heart rending. When everyone else turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be their friend. If only everyone could have that attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that could have made the movie a little better would be to further decrease adult humor and content. It was fairly restrained, but any adult humor (such as when The Grinch snapped its nose at Martha May Whovier's neckline) just does not fit into a story like that. <br /> <br /> This is a good way to be a Christmas classic by taking a richly deserved place alongside Chuck Jones' book and cartoons as a must-have in every Christmas season.
