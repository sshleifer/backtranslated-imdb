A well-made ghost story that will give you creeps and some fairly fair scares along the way. The story unfolds slowly, building the atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black. You will not forget it once you've seen it. No blood, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that is best viewed at night with the lights off.
