This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger's latest book "Freedom Next Time," which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islanders are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the neighboring island where the natives were exiled, used to be. But the British government ignored his calls to return to his homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States military, which used it as a base for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially when he documents the treatment and the current poor islanders' survivors. His interviews are excellent, and his singing from a representative of Parliament, where he uses the government's own information to identify him, is considered one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series. of newly released documents that totally illuminate the British conspiracy to expel the natives. Weaving this footage with the interviews, and the islanders' music, really increases the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to see, but "Stealing a nation" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.
