I watched this movie when I was almost a child, and of course I was tearful by this story of a family of foxes. Hokkaido's fantastic scenery, excellent storytelling and, not least, the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers, it may be useful to know that the DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I recorded both (DEFA and BR), but I still see only the first one.
