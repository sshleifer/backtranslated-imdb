This movie is simply amazing! I expected something quite different from the movie I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection with animal behavior. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is very sexual, as the explicit sexual nature of this movie looks like a high-level pornographic type. He even features a scene that comes very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual art." Every minute of the picture breathes the sex spirit of the seventies, by the way. Do not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go and see! Well worth your time and money!
