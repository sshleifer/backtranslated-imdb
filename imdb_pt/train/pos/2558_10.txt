I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We're still together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 50's, it would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the military had been explored by action, drama, and comedy for years. by this point. Mined to death. Mixed relations gave new ground to cover. This is the old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian at the time meant you owed something to someone or you were a freak of some kind. This touched on both possibilities along with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his good job as always. Garner did a better job than he usually does. He's good, but it showed how good he could be. Umecki-chan had an incredible debut here and while I think she won her statue, she did not really stretch out. It was a role that no one who was not abroad would have recognized and the novelty was the case. <br /> <br /> The real scene thief was the Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank on it. And the Japanese lifestyles have also been shown in an admirable way. <br /> <br /> A classic.
