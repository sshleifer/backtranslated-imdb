The film is a bit "skinny" after reading the book, but it's still one of the biggest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does a great job expressing the book's feelings to the film. Not many movies involve the feeling of the book, just like Mother Night.
