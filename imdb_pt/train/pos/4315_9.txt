I've just watched this movie again and I'm still appalled by the number of cynics who dismiss it as just a New Age parrot. A big movie, which takes time to develop, keeps getting close to the limit, but never comes, and in last analysis, is meditative, affecting, and truer to life than most movies that people who discard their "coincidences" can see. I was angry at the time that movies like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (though I liked the latter) were nominated for a better picture that year (let alone that "Silence of the Lambs" won!) And this was ignored with the exception of one indication for the best script. Upon revisiting it, I think the story supports my initial reaction!
