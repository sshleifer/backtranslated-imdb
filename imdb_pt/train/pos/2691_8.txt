Probably the best performance of Bigas Luna, for achieving a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delightful Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce," is the object of the pre-adolescent lust of young Biel Duran. He can not get May's breasts out of his head and wants both to breastfeed them and breastfeed his own mother as well. Your quest for May is the movie. As Luna works as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensitivity to his strange but beautiful story. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with an open mind will appreciate this sparkling erotic poem in the female breast. The images of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are beautiful and the score of Nicola Piovani is sweet and rich. A beautiful cinematographic work with a deliciously anarchic sensibility that the Spaniards naturally do.
