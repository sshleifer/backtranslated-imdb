This movie was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike some other movies I enjoyed at that time, the Baghdad thief kept up the quality while I grew up. This is not just a movie to be enjoyed by children, it can be seen and enjoyed by adults as well. The only drawback is that you can not see beyond "bad" effects (compared to current effects) like when you were a child. I did not remember anything about these effects, of course it had been ten years since I had seen this movie when I was eleven years old. Who then watches effects? One just looks for good stories and entertainment and that's exactly what this movie offers. In my opinion, this movie is one of the first great adventure films of the twentieth century. Come to think of it, I feel that the Indiana Jones movies are very similar to this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure in one, which creates a wonderful blend that will capture you from the beginning to the end, and although the film is old and the music and style of the films are clearly not modern, it can not be dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great history, the good direction and the good performances of the actors. In that department, Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing the comedy and chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great movie and, despite an "oldie", definitely a "goldie". I hope someone has the brains and courage to release this DVD someday. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
