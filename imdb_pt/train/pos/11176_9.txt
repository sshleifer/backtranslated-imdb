Ok, first I have to point out the fact that when I first saw this movie I was 9 years old. If I had seen this movie two weeks ago for the first time, I would probably have noticed that this is just another cheap horror movie made with cable with some good scenes. But when you're nine, you just do not care about these facts. This scared me a lot at the time, especially those above-mentioned Zelda-scenes (and they still do). Nowadays I'm a little bit addicted to this movie. I have to see this maybe once in a month, and on each new year's eve I watch it with a pack of 12 beers and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! I kind of agree with those people who said that the acting here is very unintelligent. Midkiff and Crosby look like I wanted Louis and Rachel to look like one, but one can not see much devotion or feeling on their faces. Hughes and Gwynne practically save the scenes that the "Creed" do not use. What I really mean about it is the fact that there really is not another movie that bears any resemblance to Pet Sematary, and I'm not talking about the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS MOVIE IS CERTAINLY ONE NEW AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly, how many times have you watched a movie that, on a superficial level, looks like a cable TV, but leaves you with a chill compared to just the best horror coolers out there? Okay, I got some balls from the cast a minute ago, but I have to say that all the pieces on that level also perfect the overall performance to perfection. But tell me if you really know any movie similar to Pet Sematary! I'd really like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the undead here ... this is way beyond the comparison in intelligence compared to these things.
