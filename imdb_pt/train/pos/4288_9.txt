Rain or shine outside, you enter a movie theater. That makes you happy. (If not, exit.) The lights go out. You calm down with an ice cream bar. Moving pictures begin to flash on the screen. You feel contented. In the dark, you're back in the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... looking at the modern version of flickering flames 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering the unfamiliar twists and turns of the scene with the rest of their clans / bystanders. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments. (Live romantic comedies ...)
