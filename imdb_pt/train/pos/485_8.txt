'The Luzhin Defense' is a good film with great central performances, but much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's art shines. It was in most of the film that the characters just helped carry the narrative forward. Marlene Gorris might have examined Lujin's psyche, instead of representing him as an innocent and tortured victim, torn apart by the cruel motives of others. Adapting the literature to the canvas is clearly a difficult task, especially novel written in the early twentieth century. This film does not go deep enough in the relationship between Lujin and Nat√°lia. Natalia's disagreement with her mother is met by a gross disagreement with her mother, rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film. I felt that I was subjected to the torment of Luzhin and to an eventual tragic end, without receiving the pleasure of unveiling his unusual and complex personality. However, this was an exciting and fun movie, but it certainly was not great.
