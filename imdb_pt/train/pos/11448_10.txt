I first saw this documentary absolutely fascinating in its initial release in 2001, and it really had a profound effect on me, so much so that I called several of my friends to watch it with me on repeat shows. Bottom line: none of my friends went away disappointed (ever!). This stellar film is about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some absolutely beautiful art pieces using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, stones, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form temporary of everything?). We begin to see Goldsworthy create various temporary works of art as well as some of their long term facilities in great galleries around the world as well as some parts in the natural world, as well. The German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process which is a real treat for the eyes and ears (with an acoustic soundtrack composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is usually experimental / sonorous textured guitar, as well as a set capable of musicians). Although this movie was already available on DVD a few years ago, if you can find a movie that is highlighting a revival of this great movie, look for it (it's easy a movie that was made for the big screen with a sound system proficient for really experience this movie the right way). No MPAA rating, but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on the screen is intended to offend or disturb)
