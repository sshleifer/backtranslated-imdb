I ventured this movie because I had a free non-new version of Blockbuster and needed to get something quickly, since the store was getting ready to close the night. The white cloak and the title intrigued me. I am a (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son is a 30 year old. I love movies that are pure fun, like The Sixth Sense, Interview With A Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is trained in film and enjoys very specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We usually hate each other's movie choices, however, we both watch and love the movie NOTHING! It was unlike any movie we've seen before. We're both cynical / critical personality types and we usually laugh at the movies as we watch - but in that case we just laugh and enjoy the movie from start to finish. It is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and screened in major US cinemas, it would have been very good.
