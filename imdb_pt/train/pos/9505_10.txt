This is a truly magnificent and moving film !!!! Ripstein's locations are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is unmistakably García Márquez, no doubt. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances such as the colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You should see this !!!
