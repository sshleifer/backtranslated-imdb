Although acknowledged as the best cinematic treatment of the difficulties of having a home in the country built (or purchased) according to its specifications, it is neither the first nor the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the protagonists in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE MONEY PIT. The first was about moving to an 18th century country house that ... err, needs work. The last was about building his dream home - in the late 1980s. Although the two films have their moments, they are not as good as the BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he is earning $ 15,000 a year, equivalent to $ 90,000 today), and lives in a luxury apartment - which in New York York that day he rents! - he feels he should look for something better. He and Muriel enter the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagines that can be repaired like the house of the dreams that they want. <br /> <br /> And the two fall into the financial hole that land purchase and construction can lead to. On the one hand, they are so enthusiastic about the idea of ​​building a home like this that they do not pay attention warning after warning by their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas in a very sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucking the chops) with a check before re-checking the correct cost to land in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he has paid about five or six thousand dollars more for land than it is worth. There are problems in the water supply that the Blandings never imagine, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis-Zis Water softening machine. They think the projects they have in mind, and worked with the architect (Reginald Denny), can not be discarded at low prices a step away from Muriel's decision to build a small nursery that no one planned. <br /> <br /> The rising costs of the project are an issue that plagues Jim. He was nominated to deal with the "Wham" account ("Spam" became a popular result of World War II in which the public began using it as a meat substitute in the light of his success with the military ). Jim can not control this (he's not alone - one or two executives got in the way before him). It comes with the following excerpt from "poetry" (?): "This little piggy went to market, He was pink and as handsome as ham. He smiled on his tracks, <br /> <br /> How they gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew he would end up as "Wham!" <br /> <br /> his secretary looks at him as if he needs a straight jacket when he reads that! <br /> <br /> Jim is also increasingly suspicious of Bill's attentions to Muriel, though (in this case) Bill is innocent. But he's always around (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the tough one, and he's keeping Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have setbacks, being the best when locked in a room in the semi-built house, just as the men have left for the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in a panic) tries to knock the door with an improvised battering ram. He breaks a window, and the door opens by itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, with all the actors seemingly having fun. It's a film that (despite changing price levels and wage levels) does not really age. After all, most Americans dream of having their own home and always have. <br /> <br /> A few years ago a painting company made use of a delightful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the painting that Parnell's company has done. do in the various rooms. She carefully shows the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. she wants - even give a polite Parnell a single yarn to the right shade of blue. The commercials suggested that the paint company had a wide variety of colors for their paint. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the introduction of the commercials. You can imagine how Parnell, who is not crazy, deals with the situation later, when Loy leaves him with his painting team.
