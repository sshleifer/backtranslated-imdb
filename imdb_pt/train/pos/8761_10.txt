I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The film is flawed only because it appears that the two accused appear to be in some monastery, working as monks in the grass and under strict disciplines almost like martial arts. The acting, the filmography and the surprising colors of what is supposed to be Thailand attract attention, but Claire Daines steals the entire film and is unexpectedly profound as she learns the harsh lesson of life to the end, in one act. of unbelievable unprecedented and completely unexpected altruism in the real world. The flaws are minimal and I recommend the movie, which seems sadly buried forever on rare TV shows. I at least want the movie for my collection - a collection of only 10 rated movies. Observe, you will be very touched.
