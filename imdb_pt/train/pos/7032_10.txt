My school's theater club will be putting on this show in the spring of 2002, and I just hope it's as good as that! I watched this movie recently as a sort of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I just like to say, Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! The broadcast for this movie was correct (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my God, is there anything he can not do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson of all time - I especially loved all his funny facial expressions and dancing during "Put on a Happy Face!" He is so good! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from desk to seductress was entirely believable. Tyne Daly was hilarious as Albert's detestable mother and George Wendt was superb as the annoyed Mr. McAfee (however, I LOVED Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau gave me a beating like Ursula Merkle; she really committed herself! And Marc Kudisch was an incredible Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" <br /> <br /> There was only one cast that I did not understand, and, as you'll see in the previous reviews, many other people did not understand. understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I mean, she's very pretty and very talented, but ... she seems a little too old for the role. Uh, maybe I'm delirious. <br /> <br /> Okay, anyway, I highly recommend this movie. It will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
