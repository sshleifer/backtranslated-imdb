This film is a Gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution. <br /> <br /> I notice the viewers that although it is advertised as a corporate espionage thriller and Ms Liu is there, it moves with purposefully still calm pace. It's not about blasts, car chases or flying bullets. You should be patient and instead write down the details here. It's calm because that's what the main character is. The viewer has to see it and think how this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers - because it destroys the point of watching. The plot is what you read in the other posts: a common white-collar guy in search of change and adventures, does corporate espionage work. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit internal data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a surrealist walk - with a background of corporate disillusionment that intertwines with a quintessential paranoia underlying the suburbs. <br /> <br /> Then he starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> Acting everywhere is superb - and yes, some of the acts are caricature characters. But they all fit together and amuse themselves. And the light piano rhyme in the background is simply perfect as the sinister soft and smooth theme: Everything is not right at first. <br /> <br /> And in the end: everything is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> Be comfortable and turn off the lights to watch this - and turn up the sound: This movie wants you to hear.
