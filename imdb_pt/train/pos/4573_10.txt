Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he plays in each of the characters he plays, making them real. <br /> <br /> I remember, many years ago, we had a party at our house - friends came, we were seated. around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having fun. The TV was on - there was a movie that did not pay much attention. Then, all of a sudden, we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not rattle, the forks did not move, the food cooled on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the canvas, where the crippled young man, whose whole body was against him and who only had control over his left foot, took a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed eternity tried to write a word on the floor . When he finished writing that one word, we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs-the triumph of the human will and spirit, the triumph of cinema capable of capturing the moment like this in the film, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character. Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot," is a fascinating and non-sentimental bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and writer and found a love of his life. <br /> <br /> I like every one of Day Lewis's performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I believe his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My Left Foot"
