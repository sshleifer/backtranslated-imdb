Now that's what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural nuances, this French film of low budget has caught my attention since the first scene. This proves that you do not need aggressive or bloody effects to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 cell mates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) become gradually more interesting, as the film builds tension towards the end. Most of the actions we see through the eyes of Carrere, who has just entered the prison and have to get used to living with these 3 other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I will not say much because this movie really deserves to be seen more widely. There are some flaws: FX's are not so good, but they're used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very messy in the end, but Malefy redeems himself when he's done. <br /> <br /> I thought his movie was really good, 8/10
