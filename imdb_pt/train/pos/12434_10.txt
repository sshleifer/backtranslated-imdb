For a first movie in a proposed series, it reaches the right balance. It is done with style and class showing the early days of Modesty as a refugee and the beginning of his rise to power in the world of crime. I think it's a very honest / true picture of your character exactly as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is incredibly beautiful and an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with a cool / intelligent / innocent exterior. And a top note for Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the part - much more believable to have a new face creating the piece. I look forward to the next movie.
