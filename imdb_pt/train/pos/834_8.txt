Shady comedy? Gallows humor? How does someone do a murder comedy? It can be a risky business because the spectator is forced to put aside his moral values ​​and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. So the story has a solid rock with a good deal of suspended reality for it to work. So Pierce Brosnan, the Irish response to 007, is now cast as a sex-addicted alcoholic who smokes marijuana and kills people who live to survive and are having a life crisis. He meets Greg Kinnear, a struggling businessman, and after a tricky start, he discovers he needs a friend. But, Greg is happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he does not have, love, home and a life. Add character actor Philip Baker Hall as the successful man's entrepreneur and we go to the races. Brosnan is wonderfully rude and raw as the anti-hero and Kinnear delightful as his colleague, the very human business man. Hope Davis adds a glow as the very conventional wife of Kinnear, who is fascinated with this abandoned that infiltrates their lives. The ending is delicious and with some surprise to him. You should leave the theater, at least in part, good - if you are able to suspend the horror of killing people.
