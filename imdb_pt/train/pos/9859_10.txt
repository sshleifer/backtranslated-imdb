The Ice Age is not just the Animation of the Year (in my eyes) it's also the best animation I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The teaser thrilled me last year and I spent many happy hours locally on the Internet. Scrat is cool! And so are the other Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the photo. <br /> <br /> I experienced your journey with laughter, tears and wonder. Nothing was forced or finished. The thrill was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that affected me deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox production. Before that, it was The Land Before Time, 1988. Everyone has real charm and seeks to entertain the entire audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
