September 11 is a classic example of verite cinema, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case New York firefighters, that fight against one of the most extraordinary events in world history. It's all tiny, low-key, handheld cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most filming (and by the director, Naudet's hand often cleaning the screen). In this movie, you meet most of the firefighters - Tony Benatatos, the novice (or probie, in NY firefighter vernacular), Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who discovers that he has lost his brother later) and a few others. There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasize the personal and thoughtful nature of the events. The buildup is quite dramatic and well done, particularly the fainting ceremony at the Fire Department, with some useful pamphlets and a somewhat limited dialectical editing of the film (as in Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men). ). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The view and angle of the camera are usually the middle of the firefighters, which is interesting and there are excellent images from inside the WTC1 lobby while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next. this is the classic movie verite. There is also the strange and astonishing sound of the occasional human body hitting the porch outside. It is then that an increasingly helpless Fire Chief realizes that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and this is before the collapse of WTC2. You have to give Naudet credit for knowing which faces will be filmed and at what time. <br /> <br /> The sound of the collapse of the neighboring WTC2 is so terribly sad, moving and terrifying that you realize how much of an ordeal it is. the firemen. From the lobby, it seems, feels and sounds like the end of the world, and the poor firemen look so confused and scared. You hear a huge quivering whirlwind - like that of a monolithic giant animal slowly falling to the ground after it has been mortally wounded - the neighboring tower collapsed, but the firefighting team remaining at WTC1 is oblivious to this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This film is captivating but the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided - clues like 'this was really a day like no other' or Naudet's often banal pronouncements like 'you can see fear in us everyone's eyes and 'I knew Tony was freaking out!' The film is really just a long diary on video. There are no photos of the upper part of the building where some of the firefighters were. Imagine this movie mixed with CCTV footage of some of the higher rooms or some of the news of the day. The effect would be greater. You could even combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and, perhaps, with the famous singer Rick Riscorla, who literally was the actor of many floors. <br /> <br /> I do not see much of an advertising element in this movie. film, as some critics suggest. This film is not Triumph of the Will, by Riefenstahl. Some time later, the firefighters put the American flag on a nearby building, survivor, overlooking what became Zero Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also some dubious camera work moments; for example, who is holding the camera when the two Naudet brothers are gathered at the fire station? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent finish, much in the tradition of the excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two bands of light reflected in the water, dancing.
