The 40 Year Old Virgin is about Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old man who works in an electronics store and does not have much social life and is very clumsy with women. Some of his co-workers in the store invite him out one night and find out that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day at the Andy store, he meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number and eventually Andy, creates enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to like each other, but Andy is still very strange when it comes to sex and he'll have to tell Trish this, to his embarrassment if he gets enough courage to tell her before things go awry. The 40-year-old Virgin has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances from all the cast, good photography and good cinematographic editing. The film is starring and is co-written by Steve Carell, who makes an excellent comedic performance and his writing for the film is very good too. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's sweet, funny, funny, fun, entertaining, intelligent, humorous and fun. This movie is as good as the Wedding Crashers this year, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen for a while. The 40 Year Old Virgin really shows a lot of talent and is well enjoyed and works like a comedy and a novel and it's sweet and a lot of fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
