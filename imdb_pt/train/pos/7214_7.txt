Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of those mystery movies in the Sleuth tradition that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the movie's plot. So I will be brief in saying that it is a play, a man who is a famous mysterious playwright, another promising writer, the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than she should have been, and a German psychic to the ride. Director Sidney Lumet, who is no stranger to filming, is very good in large part to create the tension that the film needs to follow. The dialogue is fast, new and witty. Michael Caine excels at such roles. Christopher Reeve is helpful and really grows in you, plus you see him acting. Irene Worth stands out as the funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? Love as Lumet packed her back into those real tight pants and had her dressed possibly the most comfortable tops around, but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role that should have been given to an older actress and certainly less seductive. But why argue with an obvious attempt to bribe your male viewers when nothing is going to change you now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty and elegant. The mystery has some glaring flaws that diminish somewhat, and I was not entirely satisfied with the ending, but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's high jab was enough to entangle my interest and keep him captive in the full extent of the film.
