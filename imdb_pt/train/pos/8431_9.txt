] Did not see this movie? Did not you hear about this movie? Would not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio believed in the image and was never chosen for a large distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited series, almost without promotion, and most of the great film critics did not bother to review it. I think a film based on an act, a game about apartheid and its effect on two individuals never had a chance in today's market - and it's the loss of the clever movie-lover. <br /> <br /> For the record film, Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved nominations for Ocsar (as well as the director of photography), but the film received so little fanfare that I can not even blame the academy for it. This is a challenging, thought-provoking and moving film, and actually requires the public to know it on its own terms. With that in mind, it's definitely not an irrational entertainment movie. Director John Berry wisely does not try to wear Athol Fugard's play. Of course, we received some fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic scenes, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains, in general, a story of two people living in inhuman conditions. Stripped of its basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one to attack, but each other. A third character joins them for some time (Willie Jonah, incredible in a largely silent role), but the focus of the film never deviates from the title characters and from what they have become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances like the broken couple, performances that simply could not be improved. Vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, Boesman and Lena deserve to be rediscovered in the home video. Hands down, the best movie of the year 2000.
