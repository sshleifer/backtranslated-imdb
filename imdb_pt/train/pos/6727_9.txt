I realized a few days ago that the producers of this film put a play on words in their title. This film is not mainly about the act of "mount giants", but mainly about the people who are the sport giants, Riding giants, to change the emphasis. <br /> <br /> In my teens I've lived a wedge block, one of the hardest to break and best bodysurfing in the world. I've been in waves from 15 to 18 feet, and I've ridden and been hammered by waves of 10 and 12 feet on many occasions. That experience is why I am completely impressed with the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, as a normal mortal might look, could get along with Maverick's BY HIMSELF for more than a decade is beyond my reach. The first safety rule of any water sport is "Never surf / dive / swim alone". It was where the sane people were not, and lived to tell about it. I would not go outside if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks all left. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves in Jaws always makes the skin tingle all over my body. These are not just scary waves, they are uncontrolled bowel movements. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40- to 60-foot waves (I can barely type these numbers), but actually working the faces as a fun day in Rincon, I am surprised. There is a dedication and focus on the big wave riders that is comparable to anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. I gave only 9, instead of 10, because it goes without saying that there are great big wave pilots in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserved to be mentioned. Splice on Ken Bradshaw Abroad Log Cabins and a 10 is!
