My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can not wait for the next one (I hope there is a sequel!). I would love to know how captivating music is called and who wrote it, maybe because I am "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If someone has the complete letter, please send it. <br /> <br /> Of course, one great reason why my wife and I enjoyed this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very intellectually active. It's great to see a program that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experiences. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very fun and very sophisticated, on par with some of our other favorites. , "Spooks" and "Hustle".
