The humor implicit in the full proverb of the title derives from the Sunday School saying that it would be best to prepare yourself before you are dead for the Devil's scrutiny, that is, the Devil does not care when you are dead. There is no percentage in trying to beat the devil. The characters apparently did not pay attention in Sunday School, and were forced to enter crisis management, having avoided crisis evasion. But even an experienced CEO would find it difficult to manage these crises. Playing dice is much more unpredictable than playing a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even greater than Sidney Lumet's long list of unforgettable films. So far, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor, but here he may have been interested in earning billing among other Lumet All Stars stars such as Steiger and Pacino.
