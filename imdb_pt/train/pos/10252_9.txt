After having watched "Guinea Pig", two questions come in mind (plus "I'm really a psychopath to watch this?"): "Is it a snuff?" The answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then: 'Where the hell did they find this girl?' Because she is tortured for 45 minutes without any reason (actually there is nothing else in this movie!): Nails ripped, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested with worms ... and much more until the final scene (still do not know how they did it). Because she belongs to the 'Japanese underground scene', it's obvious she did not get much money. So what were her motivations? <br /> <br /> I've seen it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (no real dialogues, the boys are just insulting her in some scenes). I have not yet seen the whole serial, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. Still, I rated 8, because if the purpose was to make people believe that this sucks, the question is very good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I'm hiding from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
