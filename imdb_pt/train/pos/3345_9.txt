What I expected: an overly stereotypical portrait of a sports-crazy guy and an equally stereotyped portrait of the girl who likes him still suffers, being the second banana of his overly zealous support of his favorite team. <br /> <br /> What I have: An odd story in which both the guy and the girl end up admitting - to themselves and to each other - that each one has passions in their lives, but each one can forgive the another to save the love they share. <br /> <br /> Sounds foolish, but with uninterrupted humor and incredible performances, this story works! Barrymore is Barrymore's classic: this perfect blend of sweet, strong and adorable. We hope she and she delivered. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the nice surprise in this movie. He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with appreciation for the normal things of life, how to care about children and their girlfriend. Fallon offers his lines with subtle perfection. He can be considerate ("You just run the field for me!") And at the same time be blinded by your love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel?") At the same time. Fallon's portrait "made" the film. Hopefully, this film marks the start of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the exaggerated mood typical of SNL alumni (ie, Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a movie that could have been victims of stereotyped male vs. female characters. feminine women who rose above this limitation and provided uninterrupted humorous lines, most of which were presented with brilliant subtlety by Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved it as much as I did. It's neither a Guy Flick nor a Chick Flick. It's a great movie to make you laugh. Go and see!
