This is an exquisite movie about finding some happiness in everyday life. The rhythm, the camera work, the emotion, the amazing soundtrack and the pure charm of this image make it a must-see. It is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally atrophied. The only flaw I can see in this movie is that it was not captured in a technically more perfect movie format. Merecia Todd-AO, Technicolor and the best available sound format (an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeters). The effect of Italian dwellings on its inhabitants would become even more exuberant and the charming little moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still requires attention like a small moving movie. I can not stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satellite. The transformations of the contained characters, tight and suspicious is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> The cast is perfect, the mood is perfect, the performance is beyond criticism. It's a movie about middle age and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtful, without hitting the viewer with heavy hand. Watch in a session and let this affect you. If you do not understand, maybe you have not lived long enough, or something else is wrong with you.
