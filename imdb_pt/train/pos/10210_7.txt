This is not exactly a great movie, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. The main theme of the film is fate and seemingly insignificant little things that can greatly change the future. In a way, this reminds me of the movie DOORS OF RUN, although instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random things happen repeatedly and each helps to build the cute conclusion. Also, a bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about it during a brief scene - as if he were some kind of omnipotent being, but there is absolutely no explanation from him in the film (like the two guys who fight each other in the movie ). Clock Tower in The HUDSUCKER PROXY. <br /> <br /> The DVD jacket shows only Audrey Tautou. This is to capitalize on her success at AMELIE, although she is only one of the many actors in the film and there is no leading role. The pace is fast, the performance is good and the conclusion is not bad. The only reason I could not score is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have been improved with fewer subplots.
