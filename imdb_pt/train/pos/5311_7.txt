John Waters' most accessible film to date is one of his best, considering that it has reduced all camp activity and absolute vulgarity that seem to foul most of his earlier work. Of course, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a way that can not be considered too filthy or disgusting. Due to some great casting choices, this film really brought the folly associated with modern art and the subjective nature of its modern artist. Funny and a little laid back (if that's possible for Waters), this is one of those movies that I watch on a rainy day.
