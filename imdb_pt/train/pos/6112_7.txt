It's first a girl's movie, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some very sweet fight scenes, I do not think any wire was used or if they were not completely empty. It's not a terribly complicated movie, it's easy for the brain, you do not need to analyze anything to get deeper meaning, a good and good chemistry between the leads and a fun watch. I wish they brought all the girls' potential for just once, because it can be incredibly cute, but throughout the movie they keep the discreet style of cute. I was watching again ... with a girl.
