I also went through a very painful personal loss (Twice) and this movie portrays the harrowing reality of this experience very well, Life out of balance, nothing makes sense, well meaning relatives, etc ... <br /> < It was nice to see Ally again. She's one of my top favorite movie actresses. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Well done!
