Do not expect a representation of "truth." However, the reports of these veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan require careful consideration. The main thrust of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and wounds of these veterans and their post-war struggles to rebuild some degree of normalcy and functionality in their lives. My main criticisms of the film are twofold: it is one-sided and advocates anti-war activism, but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of military programs and Veterans Affairs to help those I ' and I still suffer the traumas of war. These are not fatal flaws of the movie. As a veteran, I know the horrible consequences of the war are real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand, because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
