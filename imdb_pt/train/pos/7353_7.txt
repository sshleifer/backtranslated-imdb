This movie could be one of the most underrated films in Bollywood history. This 1994 blockbuster had all that good performance, music and direction. I remember I was in Allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in March at Holi's time, the people there were playing their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers at the loudest volume. If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and drool over on Marilyn Monroe, he should see this movie.Thumbs Up to Govinda.How many of you know that this movie was filmed in South India and after Sholay could be a of the few blockbuter to hit the silver screen. With movies like these Indian comedy could never be dead.
