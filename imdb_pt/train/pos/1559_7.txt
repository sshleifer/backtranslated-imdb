This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode to be aired since the reunion. This is for many reasons. For example, it takes the series back to some of its roots. He gets Lionel back from a supposedly long absence, with the Luthorcorp Plaza office in Metropolis. This room has not been in Smallville for a long time, and seeing it again brings back many memories of Smallville's past. Not to mention, Lionels' conversations with Lex are always admirable. Another pleasant return is, well uv guessed it is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only brings together former justice players but also blends them with the Smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost looks like a feature film. From there you get the movie. basic story, Green Arrow forms the alloy, tries to blow up 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark saves him and the facility is destroyed. Everything is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, rhythm and suspense. Oh, and Cyborg has some really cool new updates for the Justice League character :). <br /> <br /> Music is probably what makes this episode work so well. If you remember correctly, the first episode that Steven Deknight directed was Agless's fourth season. This was a mediocre episode, but something seemed out of place. perhaps it was the music, or acting, or the fact that the clark came out in the end "we did not find you, you found us", it kind of made people lose faith in the formula. But fortunately, Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I have had some complaints about Justice that have left it below 10. First, the Justice League's overly tacky exit from the expolsion of the Ridge facilities. I mean, it would have been a lot cooler if Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on Oliver's bike (remembering the arrow episode). Clark and Impulse obviously should have run, and the aquaman should have swum another way. But that was so unbelievably extravagant that it took 2 points out of the total of 10. <br /> <br /> Secondly another tacky moment, not as bad as the first, but when the Green Arrow says "let's save the world ". It made me shudder. All in all, judging by the acting performances, music, direction and production values, pros outweigh the cons, and this is still one of the best episodes in Smallville's history, and perhaps the second best episode of season 6. <br />> <br /> 7 of 10 ...
