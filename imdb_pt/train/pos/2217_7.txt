I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps the author to be an executive producer and writer, right?) <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. I can not describe how much I enjoyed seeing such a wide variety of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The location scenario ... I was hoping to see the houses and cottages I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, it was not enough to make me dislike the miniseries. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have it. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
