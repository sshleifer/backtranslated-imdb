For those who did not follow the case of Anne Marie Fahey Murder. You're missing out on one of the saddest but complicated murders of all. The killer is Delaware's popular lawyer, Tom Capano, and the victim is the programming secretary for Delaware Gov. Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until their disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he just would not let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two lovers and a domestic family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four-hour miniseries. While the actress who plays Ms. Fahey does a good job, she does not have her long dark hair. Her other lover is definitely more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon is more handsome and makes an Emmy-winning performance as Tom Capano. It would be better with the actual locations of Delaware and Philadelphia. With the production of Ann Rule executives, it adds precision to Anne Marie's organizational trait and her personal battle against an eating disorder. This information can be ignored by any other producer or executive director. If you have not read the book yet, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating narrative of the true crime. It's ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played the former friend and subject of Ann Rule, Ted Bundy, in another book adaptation many years ago. He was brilliant then and now. He does an above average job with an incredible story. Even President CLinton offered his assistance in the Anne Marie Fahey case. And now, former Gov. Tom Carper is now the United States Senator for Delaware, who defeated former Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 elections. If you do not think the movie is interesting, then read the book of the Rule.
