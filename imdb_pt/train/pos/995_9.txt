This movie surprised me. Some things were "clich√©" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State," starring Will Smith. But mostly great fun good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe bandits Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch again - say ... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave a 9 for the entertainment value.
