Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Even though there is a lot of poor writing and acting in parts. I think good ends up gaining evil. <br /> <br /> I love the origami pieces and the big 'twist' in the end. I absolutely love this scene when Michelle confronts Tony. In fact, it's one of my favorite scenes from season one. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated reincarnation episodes, but I've always liked them. They are not the best in terms of writing. but the theme really interests me, <br /> <br /> I'm going to give a THREE star, but if the writing was a little more consistent I would give FOUR.
