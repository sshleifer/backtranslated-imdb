I first saw this gem of Joe Sarno when, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first, I thought the movie was moving a little slower than I would have expected for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer made her entrance, the first time I saw her somewhere, I just sat there and realized. Her presence in this movie is hard to avoid, and it powers every scene she's involved in. I've seen most of Sarno's films, and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles, and I must say this was both Sarno and Jennifer in their best collective. Sarno's direction in this domestic adult drama film is superb, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) an acting prowess that makes it mandatory. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (also known as Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both co-stars of Ms. Welles, and also the frequent stars of Sarno's work, perform convincingly as adventurous but normal housewives. This movie is Sarno's classic.
