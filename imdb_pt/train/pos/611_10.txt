I affirm that whoever is ultimately responsible for the creation / approval of the trailer for this movie was completely wrong. NOBODY I know I wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and everyone who actually saw it (I know) absolutely loved it ... The hype is shame / disaster / mistake. <br /> <br /> Open at # 4 ago ... # 1-Rush Hour, which I did not see, IMDb IMDb rating of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I've seen, amazing movie, but third week out, IMDb rating average of 8.7 (deserving, I'd say). # 3-The Simpsons Movie, which I've seen, okay movie, but fourth week out, average IMDb user reviews for 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, IMDb rating average of 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but this has been ours for 3 weeks). <br /> Whether it was a bad schedule or little publicity, I think the powers behind this movie have spoiled everything! This should have been advertised as an incredible movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and not advertised as just another fairy tale ?? Too bad :( Anyway - Now that I have very dissatisfied on-and-on ... Incredible movie, go see!
