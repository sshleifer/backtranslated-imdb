It's a little easy. That is all. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but this is forgivable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificent. Everything from speech to SFX is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for all platform games such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br I have this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have 12 stars dutifully more than 10 times.
