When reading a comment from another user saying that it is a terrible game, I could not stay idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real people, full of sense of humor and credibility!), for the story, I think very good! I only complain that the enemies begin to blink when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations in the LEILA VR missions, when cycling, here and there ... <br /> <br /> But, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, great characters, great track sound ... I recommend! Certainly! It may be a bit old fashioned, but still nice! At least in Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version should be the same.
