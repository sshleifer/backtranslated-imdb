When a small town is threatened by a child killer, a police lady goes after him pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the killer, her psyche begins to take a beating, causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal. It is not a high-voltage excitement film, but a solid police job and a good representation of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser.
