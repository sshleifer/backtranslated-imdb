I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it! Every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting, the script, the direction and the general feeling of this film. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that really made me suffocate with laughter, reflect of sadness, and feel every intended feeling that comes through this great job! We need MORE MOVIES like this !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening ???
