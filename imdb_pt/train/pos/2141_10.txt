Masayuki Suo, who directed this great film, is in a role. After the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classic (in Japan at least) college comedy "Shiko Funjatta," Suo followed in his own footsteps with a resounding success. <br /> <br /> The story is engaging. We both laughed a lot (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as he is in the two previous Suo films) and really cheers for the characters. But for me, the big bonus is the look that this movie gives the viewer in Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has a way of showing real-life activities with a fun touch. The result is a movie that will entice you, make you laugh, make you think, entertain you and give you an idea of ​​Japan today. <br /> <br /> Also look for the top 8 actors of Shiko Funjatta. , as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
