If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this great movie with Stephen Rea in the lead role. The story is about the most famous rock band there in the '70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be a lot of trouble during their shows. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch.
