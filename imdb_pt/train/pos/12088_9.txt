Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable as the Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc etc etc. <br /> <br /> This program is just a good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is rather amusing. They often make jabs to each other several times in one episode, which adds a great mood to the show. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who does not like a good car chase? Especially with the coyote! <br /> <br /> I just wanted them to do a clean television like this today I recommend it!
