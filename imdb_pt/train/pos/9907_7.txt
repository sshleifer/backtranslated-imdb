"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most underrated horror movie of the '80s. It is one of the few films of its kind that is captivating everywhere. That said, it also depends a lot on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women are killed one by one in a cruel way until the final confrontation. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" is above most movies in its genre is that it goes over-the-top. Marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former colleagues. They electrocuted him when he was naked in the shower of a girl's locker room, stuck his groin with a spear, and, to top it all, manipulated his experiment in the science lab so he could disfigure it. <br /> <br /> So the victims in this movie are as hostile as you. When they meet again years later - at a high school reunion from Marty himself - you realize they have not matured that much. They are a bunch of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that they do not wonder why they were the only ones attending the meeting, which, by the way, is held in a school. which has since fallen into disuse. And who would think it a good idea to drink beer and liqueur found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have its old closets - like Marty's - on display? There are many leaps of faith that the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film. The ending makes little or no sense. And the writers have a strange understanding of how Lie Day works: the film claims that the pieces are no longer allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> In all, the film is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It's hard to understand why you still have not found the way to the DVD when so many other horror films are awarded special editions.
