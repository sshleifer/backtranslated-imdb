This movie is incredible for several reasons. Harris picks up an extremely clumsy documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small town kid who is (assumed) popular for his imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John at a local talent show (for whom he is very much in love), Gary's actions show that he is at variance with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This causes him to make several justifications for his actions, so that people do not think he is in fact a transvestite or another social outcast. In the second part, Harris explores the fight between Gary and Beaver in an attempt to make a narrative of the original documentary. The third and final part of the trilogy is truly incredible to Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second installment, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a truly troublesome character. He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community without success. Her secret passion for dressing as Olivia Newton John is farther away from people who already see her as a social outcast. The film is so realistically represented that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. Certainly, one can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but he can also identify with him as an outcast.
