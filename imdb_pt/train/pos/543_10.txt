This movie is the best horror movie with nothing. I love how Stanley ends up throwing the women on the lake. I've been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years, and he surprised me. It's a mix of horror and drama and romance, not so much comedy. His evil and charming look caught me at that moment. That look in your eyes, I will never forget. There is something about it, I can not describe it.
