I do not know how and where the Iranian directors are inspired to create such a plot. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could invent - but may not be able to project it into a movie like Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The movie is like two spinning worlds. at the same time, one connected to the other - the football game and the battle between the sexes that is happening behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> This makes you feel like you're in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you'd also like to catch a glimpse of the football game. You will feel exactly the same excitement and feelings as the female actors in the movie. It is exciting in a way that you wanted to see the end, you will want to find out the verdict, you will be dying to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainees. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to gain equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. the second Jafar Panahi movie I've seen (the first is Crimson Gold) and I look forward to watching a bit more. <br /> <br /> I'm already addicted to Iranian movies and this is a must-see!
