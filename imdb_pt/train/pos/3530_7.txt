I can safely admit (as a IMDb geek) that 'Phantom Lady' will never get into my top twenty noir movie. He may not even be in his fifties. But instead of discrediting the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film's noir genre, it should be noted that 'Phantom Lady' has strong and enduring images in it to make it a worthwhile exhibit. All that is required of the viewer is the ability to go beyond the terribly slow start. <br /> <br /> The movie is not ready until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) tries to prove everything, but alone. the innocence of his boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is Anderson's secretary during the day and amateur detective at night. As the new detective, she does very well while working the streets of New York at night. Little by little, she begins to piece together pieces of a mystery puzzle. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and it is only because of his presence that the film works well. Somehow she is able to bring to life a movie about a convict that is not at all interesting. I'm not sure if this fragmented dynamic of a characterless leader becomes the actor's or the director's fault, but clearly that's when something becomes terribly wrong with the movie. As interesting as Raines is as a rookie detective, things really speed up on other hidden equipment when "Kansas" makes an overnight visit to a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of some information to help his condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the city with a new type of red while visiting the "all night" jazz clubs. Trying to describe this scene or it will be an injustice to the scene or, worse, could ruin the scene all together. You will know the scene when the last cymbal has finished playing. If you are fortunate enough to have this movie on DVD, you will probably rewind this scene over and over again. As best as Raines is, it's this scene that makes this movie noteworthy. It's mainly because of this scene that I classify 'Phantom Lady' as a 7 rather than a 6. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this movie comes out tepid and tasteless, with some great scenes and a scene magnificent . It is the 'scene of battery / sex' that separates this movie from any other of the same type. <br /> <br /> And as it is said in the film that "you are never wrong with Vanilla", I would also like to add that "going with Vanilla" is the safe option to back off when you can not decide to have a more Tasty. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
