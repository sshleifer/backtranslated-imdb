Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in jail about a perfect assault. As he is behind the bars and can not do this he has to leave it for his girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Soon there are five guys organizing the crime - five guys with very little brain power.Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It's a crime comedy that is often very funny. You can not help laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys.There are great actors playing these characters.William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union interprets her love interest Michelle. Jennifer Esposito plays Pero Carmela's love interest. George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the tattooed guy in a wheelchair. This is a really fun movie. I certainly recommend it.
