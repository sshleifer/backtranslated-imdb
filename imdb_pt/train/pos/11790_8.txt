David Lynch's new short is a very "Lynchian" piece, full of darkness, tension, silences, discreet yet very textured background music, and presents again two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme in her work . Both characters create a very intriguing lover-slave relationship that can be seen as a direct accompaniment to the same kind of relationship presented in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
