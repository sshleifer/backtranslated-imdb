This short film is the epitome of the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum. It is sad how the future of these young people was toppled by a craps table when neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iraqi people, God rests the souls of the more than 350,000 who were killed, had something to do with terrorism or al-Quida. <br /> <br /> After this movie, the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of "Loose Change". This film is available for free on the internet, until the Bush cabal blocks it, googling-up the title itself, as indicated in parentheses. <br /> <br /> God Save our country. This will not be done following the Fascist-Christians who controlled the Halls of Congress for more than 10 years before November 2006!
