Wilson (Erica Gavin) is picked up by the police and sent to jail on this clever and entertaining example of the 70s exploration, marking the directorial debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing some of the new world films of mentor Roger Cormans, Demme had the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he offers a film that not only offers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but also has an attractive . quality of irony too; is often as funny as flashy. Highlights include an obscene and coarse vaudeville-style act performed for the prisoners as well as a powerful dream / fantasy sequence for superintendent McQueen (obviously repressed). icon of the horror Barbara Steele, making a wonderful turn in this antagonistic role). I also liked a bank robbery scene that went wrong and a car theft scene that was simply noisy. As in other such films, it is also commendable that it be a portrait of both female empowerment and pure exploitation. These women are tough, they do not take anyone's trash, and they are more than capable of dealing with themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast here gets the most out of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the cheeky Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and timid Lavelle, Gavin as the newcomer to wide eyes and Lynda Gold (also known as Crystin Sinclaire) in a brilliant appearance as an accomplice outside. As our climax ends, Demme comes up with a tense time to "hit the clock" while our heroines rush to save Belle from being lobotomized by predator Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the kind of man who does not think of taking advantage of women. Jumping along with the soundtrack of John Cales, "Caged Heat" is lively entertainment and a good guaranteed time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
