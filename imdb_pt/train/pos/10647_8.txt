I can not understand what it is that fans of the genre do not like in this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with IMDB's reviews and voters, but not this time. I waited until I got home video that I felt was another reason I would not like the movie. I believe that special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again, this was not the case. For me, the movie calls for comparison to two films that were released at about the same time. Blair Witch and Mother. Both movies I found terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made a lot of money and it was pure garbage. People liked their special effects. Movies like Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. Well, with that analogy the Mummy was a ticket B for the E-ticket of Haunting.
