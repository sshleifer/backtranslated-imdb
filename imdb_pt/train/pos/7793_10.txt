My brother brought this movie home from the rental store and I remember waiting for it to be so annoying. I think the title put me especially out. I can not remember to start a movie with such low expectations and be so completely conquered. I watched the movie twice before letting my brother take him back to the store. It's very rare for a movie to tell me the way it did. I was completely involved with Ruby's situation as she tried to get through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could have been watching for hours. Another downside is that I was dissatisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since then. She's so perfect in this movie. This movie is easily in my ten favorites of all time.
