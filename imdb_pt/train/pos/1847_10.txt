Whatever you become in your life, you should never forget that you have roots. This is the story of true facts that has been turned into a beautiful and moving film! I dare say that this film is well underestimated. This shows us a reality of life ... the more evil surrounds you, the better the person you become. Trust your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live happily ... without resentment, without living "under a rock." The concept of the film is more interesting ... connecting the narrative with real life events ... keeping us aware of everything ... from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about living your life!
