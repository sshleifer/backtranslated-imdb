Nora is a single mother who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as well as her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. Is not the philosophy of 'free love' totally out of the system? and Nora did not count on falling in love, particularly with an addict. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her incredible portrait of Nora, which ensures she does the right thing for her children, but falls in love with Javo junkie (Friels) at the same time. Garner ?? who later would be responsible for films like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTRPHES and STRANGE PLANET ?? is well-cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the HOT PROPERTY lifestyle program in 2000) appears as a bearded painter. Director Cameron's initial effort is a winner; he went on to make the award-winning MY BROTHER JACK miniseries among his later projects. But it's Hazlehurst's stunning rendition that brings to life the clever and inspirational script based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
