The material in this documentary is so powerful that it has brought me to tears. Yes, tears I tell you. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to defend our rights, to promote the greater good of the community, and to stop inventing cowardly excuses not to challenge the establishment. Chavez represents the weak and unfortunate in the same way that Bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism has gone mad. In fact, Latin America is being reformulated and the marginalized majority are finally having a say in more than five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calder√≥n. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow it to govern indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Comes with politics and back to the film; The pace is breathtaking at times and deeply philosophical in others. He portrays Chavez as a popular hero without fear of challenging US hegemony and domination of the world's resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents him from doing his homework. A crucial message of the film is to question the sources of information, as was clearly demonstrated by the victims of the snipers, being shamefully blamed by Chavez's supporters. Venezuela embarrasses the so-called American democracy. Until the revolution always!
