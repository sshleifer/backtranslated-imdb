For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror cartoon, watching this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In this context, it's wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy flaccid and lose the notion that actors are cartoon characters. The plot is also a little weak for today's audience, but it reflects very well the ingenuity of the 1940s and 1950s. Jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the war years, created to boost the morale of the troops. It gave a double meaning to the "strip" of cartoons. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been familiar to the readers of that time, a bunch of muddled Nazis frustrated by some na√Øve Englishmen, and the African jungle, of course. <br /> <br /> For Jane's fans, an obligation I see. For the rest of you, a wet abortion. <br /> <br />
