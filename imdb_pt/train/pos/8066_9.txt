One of John Ford's best films, "The Informer," does not feature any grandiose scenes from the American West. Instead, the intense drama of which Ford was known plays himself on the no less rugged terrain of British actor Victor McLaglen's face. The former boxer, who once faced Joe Louis in the ring, delivers a winning interpretation of the Oscar-nominated IRA soldier, Gypo Nolan, on the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The plot is graciously simple: In 1922 Dublin, a starving, humiliated man who was expelled from the IRA for being unable to kill a cold-blooded informant, he himself becomes an informant. For Â£ 20 he betrays a friend to the Tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and donates his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity, and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his death. actions. <br /> <br /> It is the remarkable complexity given to Gypo's seemingly simple character which is the film's most impressive achievement. In most movies, a burly type Gypo type would be considered heavy, it would have a maximum of two or three lines and would be eliminated quickly so that the hero and villain could have their confrontation. In 'The Informer', Gypo is both the hero and the villain, while the showdown is in its inner turmoil, each of which is explicitly shared with the public. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates, especially the cinematographer Joseph August, turned this to advantage by creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to Oscar 'The Informer' McLaglen also won his first John Ford along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score.
