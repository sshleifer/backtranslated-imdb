Oliver! the musical is one of my favorites. The music, the characters, the story. Everything seems perfect. In this version of the timeless classic novel turned into musical stage, the director Carol Reed gives life to Broadway in the screens of cinema. <br /> <br /> The transition from musical to musical film is not easy. You have to have the right voices, the right set, the right script and the right game. All signs point to yes for this game. It almost looks like it was written to the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in gay and old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to leave the orphanage. He crosses the country towards London, where he meets a group of juvenile delinquents, led by Dodger, the clever conversational pallet hand in hand. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older guy who sells all stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But all is not well in the city of London when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his girlfriend Nancy coil. with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and the law. What follows is a wonderful tale of love, affection, and great musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like music or not, listen to these songs and you'll be buzzing all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a work of art timeless.
