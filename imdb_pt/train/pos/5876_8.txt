Now I really like this movie, it was so funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think after watching this movie they should do many other films together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets a bit of trouble dating 3 women at the same time, but the way he deals when one goes out the door and then the other was so funny to watch, he acted a lot well in his movie and I hope he does more comedy like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he does his role very well and he is so underrated that I'm glad that some of his incredible work has been noticed, but he's really a good actor. . I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and plays well. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
