As an old white housewife, I can still understand that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates their work as in Deep Cover may like to see the incredible reach of that actor. Since I think this is your directorial debut, it might be even more interesting. All acting is very good. If you can not catch the insignificant worlds of Manhattan or the reality of crime life (not glorified shoot-em-ups action) then this is not a movie you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins together one day in a movie.
