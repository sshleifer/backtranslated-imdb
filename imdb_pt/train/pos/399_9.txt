This movie is really cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy films, you should love it. This film is Lord of the Rings of Asia: a story of high fantasy, based on current Chinese mythology. (I know that many critics have called this movie without a plot, I think they probably have no knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this should be your way. This film is still very hard to find in the US, although it was purchased for distribution in the US along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Worth the search !!! This DVD is also worthy of owning.
