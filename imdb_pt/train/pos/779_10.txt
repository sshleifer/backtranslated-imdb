In Northeastern Brazil, the father of the illiterate twelve-year-old Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her daughter to the intermediary of a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be a domestic servant and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who deflores it, and he gives the abused girl to her teenager to have her first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel on a gold field in the Amazon and explored her owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria flees to Rio de Janeiro hoping for a better life, she is exploited by the figure Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Angels of the Sun" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Mary. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever", which tells a similar story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in the countries of the Third World. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great film exposing reality, but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a frightened child struggling for survival. Most prostitutes are amateur, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glory so different from many plastic surgeries. The bitter, hopeless ending to the story is also very realistic. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Angels of the Sun"
