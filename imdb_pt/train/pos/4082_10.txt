Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a way to tell stories, but he is often compared to Walt Disney. This is so unfair because it becomes apparent when watching the Miyazaki movies that he is the top artist. He truly has a gift of thrilling adults and children, and Laputa is truly an incredible ride. <br /> <br /> But where can I start to describe such a magical and breathtaking movie! The works of Miyazaki never cease to amaze me. Laputa is a full-scale adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child dreaming of such a grand and magical adventure, how would it be? The answer would be to tie yourself up somewhere and watch Laputa, because it's really a childhood fantasy coming true. Every minute of the movie is rich and captivating ... from the train chase to the incredible aerial flight sequences ... and the wonderful view of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score of Joe Hisaishi! All you possibly want from an adventure movie is here.
