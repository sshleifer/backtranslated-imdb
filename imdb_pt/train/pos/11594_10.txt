I just found the IMDb and searched for this movie and I was almost crying with comments from all the people who saw this movie like I did when I was 6 or older in 1967. I saw this before the Jungle Book so I went the Eagle Boy for a few hours and then the Mowgli for next year. I started crying in the movies when the boy became the Eagle and always wanted to see the movie again. When we got home, we had a roast chicken dinner and I got the bone of desire and guess who I wanted to be? My father then said 'I bet you wanted to be an eagle' and of course we all know that desires are broken if someone guesses more tears and a little bit of resentment to this day for not being able to fly away ...
