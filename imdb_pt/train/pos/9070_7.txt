It started slowly after a great animated introduction, since the director had a lot of characters and scenarios to develop. Once the bet is activated, the movie picks up the pace as it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten until 7pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son: bullies, helping others, caring about the matter when you do not want to do something. <br /> <br /> Of special note is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director kind of invades her unexpectedly, and when she's onscreen, she's catchy. She's one of those guys. "Hey, she looks familiar," and then I remembered that she was the little girl Pepsi introduced eight years ago. She was also in "Paulie," that movie about the parrot trying to find its way home. <br /> <br /> Ms. Eisenberg made many TV and film appearances in 1999, but was not seen much in the years to come. She is now 14 years old and growing up to be a beautiful woman. Your smile really warms the screen. If she gets a few more good roles, could she have such a good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, plus three boys named, but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment has had lately. Anywhozitz, according to my 8-year-old son, who just read the story, the movie did not seem to follow the book as well, but it was fun nonetheless. The end of the movie seemed like a great arrangement for some sequences (How to Eat Cooked Slugs? Escargot Kid's Style?), Which may not be such a bad thing. It was good to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear generated by the director Mr. Burdock. (Boilerplate). Currently, films tend to show adult figures as clowns. While he has a particular scene, he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also good to see Andrea Martin getting some work.
