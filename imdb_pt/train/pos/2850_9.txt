The Japanese "Run Lola Run" is an infrequent film that puts a smile on anyone's face. Fans of Run Lola Run, Tampopo, Go! And Slacker will probably like this one. It tends to follow an increasingly popular formula in the days of separate and seemingly unrelated vignettes, all contributing to the overall story in unexpected ways. Take it if you see it otherwise, wait for the rent.
