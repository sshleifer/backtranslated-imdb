I recently watched Caprica again and thought I might as well come and write a review! I saw this shortly after I saw the end of the Battlestar Galactica series (being a big fan of the show drove me to anything I could from the universe of the shows) so I did not know what to expect ... but I left with a smile though I must admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on caprica's planet and we are presented with a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give much but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of history, but I suggest you watch it. <br /> <br /> I must say ... Esai Morales is a great actor that he took out of the young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his place of acting and I could believe that he is the father of William Adama of BSG ... Also Eric Stoltz fits in his role precisely . ..! Special note was nice to see Polly Walker out of Rome! Do not sit and watch Caprica with the expectation of being like Battlestar Galactica because the story is very straightforward and anyone can watch it ... without having to see BSG! <br /> <br /> This show is a well written drama for anyone who enjoys drama with a science fiction kick!
