Well, you take OJ Simpson as a whole American soldier turned every American bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just in case no one else goes and Art Johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who does not know what to do, but does not Do not want to admit that they are in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three bad boys face to face who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a bus full of people to die for dessert and you have to take action, twists and lots of drama. Everyone was nice, but seeing Lamas as the worst of the bad boys really surprised me. He was very believable as the arrogant thug who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who was trying to stop him. This was evidently long before he cultivated his image as a good man. And believe me a 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans that you really will not want to miss!
