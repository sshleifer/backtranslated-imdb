This movie is like an allegory of the gospel. It has such direct honesty and innocence that you can not believe it was made after the world war, when Italy was devastated and devastated, and was filled by a huge population of homeless and impoverished. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as to the infinite creative resources of this land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like Doestoevisky's "Idiot," a modern Christ finding his way into a big city. He is kindness and purity strengthened by love, and his deeds change the people he meets as much as the miracle he worked. The story is told in a natural way and simple style, but imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealistic fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring and uplifting films ever made.
