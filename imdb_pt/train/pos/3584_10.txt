My name is Heather and I'm the girl whose story this movie was based on. I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and liked it. as coarse and rough as some of the things that were portrayed in this movie were, did not even come close to describing how bad things really were. not to mention the affection that had everything in my mother and little sister. Thank you once again for the great comments everyone has made, I really thank them <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It's hard to believe that so many years have passed since this movie was made. Even harder to believe that people were still watching for a year. For any of you who have experienced the same kind of situation, please know that there are people here in cyberspace who fully understand how they feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.
