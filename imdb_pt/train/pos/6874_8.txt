A series of vignettes, most of them slandering television in the 1970s, but also with some excavations in government and corporate America. One of the longer segments, "The Dealers" is not so funny to me and I do not know what parody is. Some of the others, however, are absolutely divided. I particularly like the culinary segment. Most dirty words I know are used in the movie, and if you object to full frontal nudity, stay away.
