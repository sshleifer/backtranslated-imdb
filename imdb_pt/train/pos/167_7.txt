"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an old Crawford-Gable vehicle of 1931. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, drinking and undressing to jump off a yacht and swim. This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) out of money. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper using the name of Mary Smith; Her brother works for smugglers. The chief man is Jake Glove - played by Clark Gable while he plays another villain. Later, of course, he would become a romantic hero, but in the early 1930s, MGM used him as a villain. Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie approaches Glove. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford made a great team. Her facial expressions are a little wild, but that, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to watch pre-recorded movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
