This movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you watch with your friends, it can be a very good day ... Obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very badly directed and acted (Tomba / Unziker that couple), and this is probably the worst movie in the world , but you can have lots of fun. We attended at 19 and it was a very enjoyable evening. The best scenes are the first, when criminals kill Alex's friend, and he tries to act like a desperate, and the result is a first-rate comedy scene ... And then, when he shows to Leva (Antevleva, what a name) the "Palassio di Giusstissia" and then the accident of Leva, who is once going in his car off the road, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What magic!
