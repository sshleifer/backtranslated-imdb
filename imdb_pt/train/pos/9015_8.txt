At first, this one is from England, so, of course, I was 98% likely to be smart and very good cinema. I've never heard of this movie before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself, "Oh! Here comes the feminine version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was wrong, too. Wrong because the two films are very different. My Left Foot was a John Ford movie and this is a Chaplin movie (not because it's funny but for Chaplin with that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) I was right because in 1990, Daniel Day-Lewis becomes a bit ugly when interpreting a crippled person and made it with a great sense of reality. Here, very pretty Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very clever. To me, Miss Bonham-Carter is one of the greatest women of the '90s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look into her eyes! She had the most beautiful movie eyes from Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a true talent, as seen in many other films. See this one, you will not regret it! And a very good job of Branagh too!
