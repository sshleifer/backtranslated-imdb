This is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the misconception of the general public as a teen movie. It has wonderful performances, particularly a fight scene between Jodie and her mother, performed by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are a bit amateurish, but I think it's worth seeing.
