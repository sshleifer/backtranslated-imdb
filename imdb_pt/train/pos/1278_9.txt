"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that ironises pop culture to the point of humorous self-description. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at / sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked the most ... Simon Geist is a 30-year-old man who creates a pop culture-driven editorial magazine called "The Next Big Thing." "The truth is that this magazine does not really exist, and it's just an excuse for Simon to approach the actors, interviewing them, just to slap their asses, insulting the way they buy pop culture. Darla is also writing a magazine (which is real), which has to do mostly with her and Simon, as well as with her and her father. Darla is a genuinely lovable character, depending on how you view her behavior I've never seen anything like this before, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it. "Magda is a prostitute, the character I liked the most. interesting together.And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do.It's a wonderful movie and I suggest you see if you're in the indie crowd / art house.Check my words! > <br />
