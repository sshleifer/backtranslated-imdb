There is good reason why Walter Pidgeon is warning Leslie Nielson and his rescue ship crew, things he does not dare to dream about. Like Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. Since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only humans left on this planet that was once home to an ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> The records deciphered by Pidgeon indicate that Krell has reached a cataclysmic end of unknown origin. The machinery they left behind is still working. <br /> <br /> Perhaps working very well, as members of the rescue team begin to die and in a particularly repulsive way. <br /> <br /> I see all sorts of speculation about a remake and this is a movie that is not remaking because it is as new as it was in 1956. The terms would change, we would now say bending speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We may not see the men on the rescue expedition on a flying saucer as a spaceship. It may look much more like the Enterprise spacecraft or the 2001 ship, a Space Odyssey. It's interesting to watch science fiction films from different generations and see how the conceptions of the future change. <br /> <br /> The story behind the Forbidden Planet is eternal, about mortal beings trying to play God. <BR> You can not write about the Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical marvel, brought together by Pidgeon with the knowledge he acquired in studying Krell, was a great success in the past. He got a new life in the 60's with the Robot character Lost in Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook in the spaceship and his fulfillment of Earl's request by some domestic spirits are very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost to The Ten Commandments and the division of the Red Sea. The bad luck of Forbidden Planet to come across a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> The classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic remake of The Tempest which, when you think about it, could have been that of Shakespeare. Venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens, which is a sacrifice that allows Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this song every time it is broadcast.
