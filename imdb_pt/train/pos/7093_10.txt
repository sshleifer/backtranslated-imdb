With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do you'll probably find a lot to enjoy. I know I did. The story is interesting and copes with time traveling. One virus killed many people in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he is arrested and hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the psychiatric hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe Cole's stories. The film constantly plays with time. Cole makes a call and leaves a message in 1996, is caught in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, someone appears only a few seconds after the call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you should keep your attention. You could ask some questions, but since you can not have an answer, you better agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkeys' works like science fiction, with great images and a somber atmosphere. and functions as a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next and that helps the movie. It may be that there are some flaws in the story, but since it is a fictional thing like time travel, you must accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.
