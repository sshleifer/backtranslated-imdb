Let's face it: last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons on any show I've ever enjoyed (mostly, I've never encountered dry spells to last a whole season). But if you judge this show last season, of course it will seem inferior. This is a totally unfair assessment - because "That '70s Show" was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there were not so different from what we are here in modern times. <br /> <br /> All right ... ignoring Season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace stars as Eric Forman, an excited nerd of a teenager with a perpetual love of Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next door. Playing his friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best is probably Fez, an exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as them. What country is he from? Try to find out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is both formidable and sweet, more or less as Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red exists primarily to scare the pogees of all. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well in front of each other as the parents of Donna, the chauvinist but sympathetic, Bob and Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances like Leo, a junkie who acts as a father figure for Hyde. <br /> <br /> In addition to the anachronistic mistakes that pop up quite often and the exaggerated lessons that sometimes come (and this deplorable final season), "70s" is a wonderful show with incredible writing, direct direction and a vibe of well- be pulsing in each episode. They are all well.
