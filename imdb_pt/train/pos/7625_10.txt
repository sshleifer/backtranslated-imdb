Although Kurt Russell was and probably the closest person to resembling Elvis in show business, a lot of things were fake in this movie. First of all, the producers claimed that Elvis opened his famous live shows in 1969 after 9 years of movies wearing a white overalls made in 1972. They also said that he sang "burning love", which he sang in 1972 and " wonder of you, "which he recorded for the first time in the 1970s. They also claim that he had his first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know all movies based on the past have something fake, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
