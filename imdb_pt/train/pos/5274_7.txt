Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I was growing up, I saw this movie so many times that my father had to buy another copy on VHS because the old copy was worn out. <br /> <br /> My family received a VHS copy of this movie when we bought a movie. new VHS system. In the beginning, my mother was not sure if it was a movie suitable for a 10 year old, but since we just bought a new VHS system, she let me watch it. <br /> <br /> Like I said, is this movie the whole dream of little boys? The film contains fantastic scenery, great muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, great bad monsters and jokes that you only get when you get older. So a few days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first, I was bored, so I started thinking about how much I loved this movie as a kid, and kept watching. Yes, the experience was not as good as I remembered? The acting is really bad, the plot is really bad, the jokes were no funnier but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Even though the experience of the movie has changed for me, I still think it's worth seven stars. For the good old days you know?
