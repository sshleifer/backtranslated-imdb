Charles Boyer was supposed to be Spanish and came to London to buy charcoal in "Confidential Agent", a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is willing to stop him except Bacall. His documents are stolen, he is accused of murder, but is determined to get coal for his people, so they can fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This movie has its good points and not so good. It ranks high for atmosphere and for suspense, and is highly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly handsome, Boyer is in love, Paxinou is stingy, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix is ​​pathetically appropriate, and Seymour is outrageously wonderful. <br /> <br /> The not so good points: Bacall is supposedly English, and Boyer Spanish. Oh no. Boyer is fantastic in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not British upperclass. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a bit miscast. His performance is not good either; she is better at other movies. But she is a woman of surprising appearance, and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost on top and obnoxious. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the other actors' directions are not so good. This was definitely a case of no small parties, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, even with its flaws.
