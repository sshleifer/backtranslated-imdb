I agree with all the compliments, I went through a box of tissues watching this movie. He had a brave authenticity and it sounded true in every way. <br /> <br /> The issue I am about to raise represents a current sensitivity to the treatment of animals. I had a very difficult time with the beginning of slaughtering of sheep and goats, and the deer dying with its pulsing neck and piling up blood while its life was drained was horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the era of "animals were not injured in the production of this movement". Iphigenia was made in the late 1970s before the advent of computer simulation. Is it possible to falsify these animal deaths? Or were these animals slaughtered by art?
