I really enjoyed the first two seasons. because many good characters disappeared later. Since most shows are a bit slow at first, better in the following seasons, but that's the absolute reverse. Jenny from Season 1 and Valarie from Season 2 were Sabrina's friends, I did not really care about the others, Jenny and Valarie were their coolest friends. I think for some reason, the producers wanted us not to like their college friends, for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode of season 1 is the cat showdown and my favorite episode of Season 2 is the witches' trash, which is the funniest episode. I also found it funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but was always wanting to be with Harvey. I just wish they had made better ones. I also liked how the first two seasons, during the opening credits, Sabrina said a few words while wearing a costume, as in the pilot episode where she is in witch costume, I liked how she said "this is not me" and then She kept trying to move to something else is what I think, but this is a really cool show. It's kind of like Andy Griffith's show in a way because it's good at first, but as soon as color and barney fife were gone, it was good too. but I still enjoy watching, but the only reason I watch later seasons is because of sabrina. what I meant about the opening sequence is: the opening titles of seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with various costumes and different outfits while the names of the cast members flash quickly at the bottom of the screen . In the end, Sabrina said some pun relating to the outfit she wore and disappeared. the opening sequence of the fourth season includes the characters in bubbles. season opening credits 5-7 present Sabrina in various locations around Boston
