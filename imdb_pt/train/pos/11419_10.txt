The debut of Claire Denis is both courageous and sure of itself. In this depiction of life at the end of French colonialism, Cameroon, it explores the relationships between men and women, black and white. With the black servant Prot√©e as the main goal of the film of desire and oppression, the film enters taboo territory from the beginning. Denis builds an image of life through a series of character relationships that keep the viewer informed on the screen. The mood of the film is captured perfectly by camera work and (lack of) lighting. <br /> <br /> A great speech.
