Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side. And a remarkable one is, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai hi-society - stars and starlets, glam dolls and wizards, business moguls and types of broker, yes all smelly lot - are in sharp focus here. In the typical tabloid form, their worlds unfold, with each colored story a clever sub-plot in itself. A struggling star abandoned by the producer after he had conceived her, the stewardess and her high-profile husband, the pedophile entrepreneur and his neurotic wife, the reporters and the police captain; all the tonalities on display and countless tones between them. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar does a great job of digging the dirt on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the undead. Atul Kulkarni punches as well as Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as the former crime reporter, but she could have stayed a bit more in line with the job change and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> Highly focused (140 min run time) and different refreshing film, well worth the money.
