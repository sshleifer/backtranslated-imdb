National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic 80's comedy movie that combines unique characters, lots of laughs and some great Chuck Berry songs. When Walter Bailor is utterly humiliated by his high school classmates, he seizes the opportunity to take revenge on his class reunion. One by one, he pursues his classmates, who include an innocent blind girl, a fat fat man, the beauty of high school, the king of all preparations, and even the ugly lady of the snack that served the children during high school. This movie has a kind of scary element and has some brief sexuality scenes so I would not recommend it for small children, but it's a great teen movie. If you're looking for a movie with a beautiful soundtrack, complex characters or killer effects, you might not enjoy Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have great laughs and lots of fun (and who does not like it), then this movie should be in your movies to see the list. ++
