This is not a good movie, but I still like it. The Clovis cat is gold in a jar, as is the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil Sleepwalkers. I think there is more to this film than people realize, it's basically very rough, but that abruptness can sometimes be good. It has the cheeky lines, the abrupt ending and a comic element conveyed by the clumsy cops. <br /> <br /> Did anyone find the incestuous element a little disturbing? Ultimately, this film is casually and randomly acrimonious, which is quite effective, I compare it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and child, the change of protagonists. I think the blunt also works, this is not a movie that you want them to prolong, it only works if it's short. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure if the director has no depth, or if he did these things on purpose, we know that Stephen King has ability, but I did not even read his books, I only saw some of his movies . <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like hard movies with 80's tones, just watch. but do not expect too much. It's so bad that it's good.
