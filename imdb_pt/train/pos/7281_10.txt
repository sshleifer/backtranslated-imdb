I saw this movie for the first time at a local station on the Sunday afternoon horror show, circa 1969 or 1970. No cuts. I was just a little kid at the time, but I loved it and I was not really scared of it. I thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline. Thinking back, I'm still surprised that this was shown during the day on uncut TV in those years. I've been looking for this movie ever since, I've seen it over and over again, and always loved it. One would think that John Waters would have idolized this movie. It has to be not just a scary movie, but one of the most despicable and pompous movies ever made at the time. And, surprisingly, you do not hear about this as having the following cult that a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" has acquired over the years. It has a following cult, but it should have become a cult classic in my opinion. As far as I know, this came out just before Blood Feast came out, making this probably one of the first real "bloody" movies. In fact, this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and a bit of Russ Meyer for good measure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who likes black and white horror movies early 60's (I think the date at the end of read 1960).
