"A Truly Nice Story with a Moral on Brotherly Love" describes this strange film by David Lynch. This was especially "strange," because it was not the kind of film Lynch had been casting in the last 15 or 20 years. Those were dark and shocking movies (Blue Velvet, Wild Heart, Mulholland Drive) and that's the opposite. I know this has disappointed many of your fans. Others were delighted by this. Count me as one of the last, and I also own all three "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This was another supposedly true life story here detailing the journey of an elderly man in a Western Iowa sitting lawn mower all the way to Wisconsin to see his sick brother with whom he did not speak in years, but he wants to see before he dies. Well, I guess this premise - an old man driving a 400-mile lawnmower - still makes it sort of a "weird" movie, so Lynch stays in character with it! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the lead role. He's the kind of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, discreet personality that almost everyone likes. The wrinkles on the face tell a lot of stories. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this movie was released. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this film are not much, and not always enjoyable, as they show the main characters the adult child and mental problems of the character (Sissy Spacek) and his tragic past, but since Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey, the story begins. I touched this to several friends and they thought the movie NEVER caught on, but I'm more generous about it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found your trip quite fascinating, but you have to realize beforehand that this will NOT be a suspense story about Lynch. It's slow and if all is well with you, you may like it. Charm comes into the picture in some of the people Alvin finds along the way, like a rebel girl running away and some cool people from the city who help the old man out when he's in trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that respect.) Harry Dean Stanton is in third place, but that's a joke: he's only in the last minutes of the movie! Iowa It's nice, I've lived there for several years and I can attest to the hills and the rich soil It's a nice state with nice people ... like this movie.
