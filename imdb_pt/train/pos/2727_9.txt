One of the best crime films ever made and very true to Truman Capote's book, which invented the true romance genre. Haunting Quincy Jones and excellent acting from Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry the Assassins. Why did not Wilson become a big star after this movie is a mystery to me? <br /> <br /> Cinematography and black and white editing in this film are top notch. The re-creation of the murders is scary and since it leaves the murders real to their imagination, even more frightening than if they had shown the shotgun firing. The film was filmed in the royal Clutter house that had been sold to someone else after the murders. The film looks very documentary - in addition to the scenes at Clutter's house, other scenes were filmed at gas stations and shops where the killers really were. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is in the movie. Will Geer has a major turnaround as the prosecutor in the short-scene trial that is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the true jurors of the murder Clutter portraying as the jury in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid, scary movie every time you see it.
