The world at war is one of the best documentaries on World War II. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes cover the war and how it was in the countries involved in it. The first episode tells how Hitler came to power and how he was able to build one of the strongest armies in the world. They also fucus on the military actions taken during the war and the holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You should all watch this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
