For a low-budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who now stars on the TV show "Dragnet", is sexier than ever. The locations were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps that script moving. Although this movie has a lot of problems, such as continuity, I must say I would rent the director's next movie. If you are a film student, you can learn a few things from the principal's comment.
