Recap: It's business as usual at the Casino de Louche in Tangier. The casino is about to close and gets ready for a big deal the next day. The owner Louche and some staff leave for the evening, leaving Modesty in charge. Suddenly, a gang of armed gangsters invades the casino, firing frantically. Unknown to Modesty, they have already killed Louche, and now they are behind the money hidden in the safe. But nobody present, and still alive, in the casino knows the code to open the safe. The safe itself is heavily jammed with explosives so the assailants can not blow the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty comes face to face with gang leader Miklos in a roulette game with their lives at risk. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a written review without any connection to the published media. Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read any of it. The first point I like to make is that this is a little improperly ranked. Most of all I thought this was a thriller with an intelligence battle between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some explosions of action, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the main plot and the main scene full of suspense is the game between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way to reveal a character's background, and in doing so, much of the story takes place outside the casino long before. Someone said that he is almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling is that it can be used as such. But I felt that it was a much better way to introduce a character than many others did. I was not at all disappointed with the lack of action, instead I enjoyed this game, much more story than a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden especially portrays Modesty very well, and really carries that confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
