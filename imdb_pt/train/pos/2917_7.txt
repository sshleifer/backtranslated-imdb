While this movie is not a classic by any stretch, it's a lot of fun as I remember it. I saw about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur" and, while not as funny as this movie, shows the potential that Steve Gordon achieved with "Arthur."
