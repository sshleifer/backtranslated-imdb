I do not know why this does not happen in Peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny and clever British comedy. It is at the end of the "swinging sixties". Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich womanizer in his forties. The perfectly appetizing Goldie Hawn, playing a 19-year-old American girl in London, is initially the "catch of the day" by Sellars. But the TV food critic can not help himself from falling into the vertigo of the American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathetic, great script, strong leadership and support to the caste. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, and the best joke is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it.
