I'm not saying that just as a fan of Chris Rock, I'm saying this as a person who had low expectations going for this movie and it turned out wrong. The first flaw was the finalization of everything that everyone saw coming. The number two flaw was that I discovered that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock looked fake. Finally, the performance in this film was unsatisfactory, with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw that failure and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, note that heaven can wait, it's better. So for all Chris Rock fans, WATCH THIS MOVIE, you'll have fun. He has a good stand-up in this movie. <br /> <br /> General: 7 of 10
