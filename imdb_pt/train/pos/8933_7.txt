Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not need to tell a story, that is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to pick up the ingredients and make them what they want. Ostensibly the idea In the framework of a non-linear film, the older man lives on the Franco-Swiss border, a man dedicated to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose heart condition threatens every your life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets him, but when he finds he needs a heart transplant, he chooses to go to Tahiti for Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and revive a long-lost relationship. with a son he had formed a Tahitian woman years ago. <br /> <br /> What Denis does with this sketch of a story is to use his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, the interaction of man with people. vs animals, etc. Most of the time the 'movie' does not make sense, but this is because we have tried very hard to connect all the dots placed before us in beautiful images. Life is more or less like this: we look, see, observe, integrate, process and make of it what we want. <br /> <br /> By using this form of making films (as she did in the strangely beautiful 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis developed a signature technique. Whether the spectator finds the reward of the finished product or not has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers will find an excessively long speech about very little. Maybe watching it again will change that. Grady Harp
