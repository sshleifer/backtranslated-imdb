This film, although it is about one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers producers: extreme life in our cities, has a funny way of putting it on screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican directors of recent times approach stories of our city framed in various types of literary, such as the farce or the satire, which gives us a film with a superexposed topic in our country, but narrated in a very different way that gives it a tone of freshness. <br /> <br /> With little-known actors, but who perform in an excellent way their role, each of the directors reflects in the stories the capacity we have been identified anywhere in the world, the ability to laugh the pain and to make the celebration of sorrow. Perhaps for many people in our country the film did not please, but I consider that people from other countries could find it attractive and share the surrealism of the Mexican.
