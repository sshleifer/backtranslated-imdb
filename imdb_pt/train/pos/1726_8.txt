While I was thinking of "The Great Escape" I allowed my mind to wander back to this little jewel from a movie from my childhood. I read and reread the autobiographical novel of 1949 that inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (we never actually used that word) in the city that featured "foreign" movies, I was the first in line to buy As someone created on war and propaganda films during World War II, I had an avid interest in exploring the realities of this conflict as reflected in the memories and stories of men who were there in person. . This later extended to a great desire, over the years, to buy any book on the subject, and finally to read the equally convincing novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided an even deeper sensibility. The film versions, however, were different from the one in which they rarely distributed the goods. <br /> <br /> The medium of the black-and-white film has never been so well served as in those years. I've never seen a technicolor version of the war that seemed as authentic as the depths of film history as "The Wood Horse." If it is true that we are destined to be always captive to the images of our childhood, then I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Leo Genn as the iconic British war hero. in the movie. Not even Sir Alec.
