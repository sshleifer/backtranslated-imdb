NOTICE!!! TONS OF GIVEAWAYS DEAD !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, WHATEVER YOU ARE <br /> <br /> There are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and leaves with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can not be said. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and they wanted to stop watching it, or people who wanted their hero (or villain) to stop for their last breath, that movie was it. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a parody of the Wizard of Oz, so you see a boy who is called just like John Doe, who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and leaves the Freddy territory. A woman who lives in a hospital / place to put the kids in the right place meets this kid and at the same time has a dream about a man, a water tower and a promise of a secret floating in his mind. He returns to Springwood to discover this frightening sight, and soon discovers that she is Freddy's daughter, and soon we discover that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a kind of host for him. And in addition, the fear follows. This movie seems to hit everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This film has lots of humor and appearances as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a drugged teenager who sees the psychedelic vision of flowers and "In-a- gadda-da-vida "of Iron Butterfly, then gets stuck in a kind of super Mario parody. This movie will make you hate this movie or like Krueger even more. The best of the best.
