This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything in my opinion was top notch from acting to directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, if not on DVD. That being the case, why is not this? A friend recorded it out of TCM for me, but having it on DVD would be great. For special characteristics, they might say that a Navy historian talks about the battle, and if Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they could also be interviewed. Anyway this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it's released, I hope it's not colorful. Coloring, in my opinion, would ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 film would go. Mr. Garfield did a great job of portraying Mr. Schmid. Some actors may have tried to exaggerate the part of Mr. Schmid's deficiency, but I think he did. I sincerely hope they come out with this DVD movie someday as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other Marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War II.
