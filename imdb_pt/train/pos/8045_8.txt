I finally got to install myself on a DVD rental service so I could find movies that were not available in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and also as small, often overlooked films. <br /> <br /> This is a gift! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to fool him because you only see him as your alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this movie, Meloni is a lifelong step-out mid-life who is hitting the skidding in many ways, only to find a way to happiness in someone unexpected. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and the character of Tim Busfield is realistic and not over. I have not seen Busfield since the 1930s, and it was fun to watch. But it was all Chris's movie. I've become a fan girl again. <br /> <br /> It's a bit slow at first, I'll admit. I thought some of the flashbacks might have been edited. But overall, this movie will enchant you - male or female - because it has an honest and refreshing view of current relationships.
