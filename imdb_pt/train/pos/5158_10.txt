There is something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. From the outset, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a particular planet will explode in a few hours. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy went downstairs to evacuate the inhabitants, who seem to have gone off to parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian. Librarian's educated but enigmatic advice on where all citizens What happened was interrupted by a crisis in which the three crew of the Enterprise unexpectedly were being launched at different times of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a period of time reminiscent of 17th-century England while Spock and McCoy are trapped in a desolate and frozen garbage. The criss-cross between the two stories, and the different dangerous situations in which men meet is superbly treated, with the return to the present an unknown chance while the minutes are counted until the planet's blast. <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and good performance characterize this episode, with a touching performance of Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled in the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urban librarian. Something reminiscent of the classic episode On Forever's City On The Edge, this time-travel story is a rich and compelling ending to the series, which concluded an episode later. This should be one of the best of the whole series, especially notable, given the generally lower quality of the third season overall.
