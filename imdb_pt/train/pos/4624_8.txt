Believe it or not, Inspector Gadget's Last Case is what gets me hooked on the whole Gadget thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm twelve, so obviously I was not around when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career. Of course, I had heard of him, but I did not really know him. <br /> <br /> While reading, note that I have never seen the original series (I would if it came!). This is just the thing about gadgets I've ever watched (though I'm obsessed now) and I'll focus on what I liked about it, since everyone is so negative. To all pessimists, I also have some cons. = P First, for a childish sense of humor, you might consider this movie very funny. I thought it was, so sue me. I also thought the animation and character designs were good, and I'm also glad there was more Gadget in it, since it's my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then there was Claw (his voice was horrible, though) and the Madcat; I thought they were made pretty good too. The idiocy of the gadget looked very well in place, if not a little overdone (for example, thumb sucking the thing from the hat.) Would be a good screenshot, however. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that ran in the credits. Yeah, I'm weird. <br /> <br /> And like all movies, there are some negatives as well. <br /> <br /> Talking cars? What is up with that? You could say this was for younger boys. That would not bother me so much if there was not the fact that the cars basically saved the day. I wish Penny and Brain had taken their place. And, apparently, Gadget loved his car more than it would be called natural. A little strange, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the boss was downright mean to Gadget. I mean, sheesh, yes, he was not always the most cheerful of people, but he did not hate Gadget, from what I read. Like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. I thought the animation made up for the plot centered on the car and, on the whole, it was pretty decent; more than the live-action Gadget movies (quartered, butchered, BUTCHERED!) at least. Maybe I'm just biased because that's what put me on Gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is distorted, or maybe I'm just weird, but I really liked this movie, even if I'm the older one, it's recommended to .
