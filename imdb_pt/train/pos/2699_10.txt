There are other comments here, so I do not need to say how great it is or what it's about ... My point is: I've heard about this movie for a long time, before being shown. I can not even remember HOW, I just know it was over the internet. Distributors suffered before they hit! For months I rode a motorcycle and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to buy this movie and the only area highlighted is the VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use the Alta Vista Babelfish to translate. I know it's the PAL format and they've changed the text on the screen to German and there's a bit of narration in the beginning that was also dubbed in German, but as hilarious and extravagant as this movie is, it really just makes it funnier! If you want to see this movie and have a place nearby that does conversions, it's worth it! It cost about twenty dollars to get to the US from Germany. Believe me, it may seem like a lot to spend on a movie, but if you like cheeky b-flicks, you'll be blowing money left and right getting conversions to your friends!
