I remember very well seeing this when I was 3 years old, so my parents accidentally recorded all their few seconds, except for a few seconds. So I was about 8 or 9 when I rediscovered it and since then I've been able to better understand things, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I re-discovered, thanks to some Internet articles / video clips and it's not just the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with kids, but for us 20-30 years it's definitely got "Cult Status" written all over the place. It is a pity that the original production has gone through a painful process; if Fox had been long enough, he would probably be more recognized in the eyes of the public today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and a star voice cast might be, but that's for Fox to decide. I digress here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than great.
