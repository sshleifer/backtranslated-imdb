One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it has always been a favorite ever since. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the 1960's, people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a current musical named CERTAIN Academy Award based in a large midwestern city). All the major roles were beautifully released ... Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as well as Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a menacing Bill Sikes (who fortunately has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as the Dodger were great too. Mark Lester looks like an innocent waif, which was what Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers who act on "consider yourself," "I would do anything," "Who will buy," and "Come back soon," many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
