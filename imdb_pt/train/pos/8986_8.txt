Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. Watching him hit a song, if not an entire album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks he's god, but he's so prolific and interesting. The DW is not really that interesting in the musical comparison or not. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton tells the cameraman, "Well, let's attach this guitar!" Great use of footage / home video. Great to see rock docs still being made. A legal document about the creative process. If you like this, go see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold off! on DVD. A good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
