Excellent movie showing the pathetic life of two crazy old women. They could not live together or separate. Stammering constantly, sometimes at the same time, they coagulated and revived the past; coming and going on what coulda shoulda woulda. I found myself laughing at times, but most of the time I was struck by how sad and abandoned these two women were. See this one here.
