If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, grab your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is so good, just different. I will not detail the differences because it would spoil the movie. Also, it's a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain, and the supportive cast is superb. I think the quality of the supporting cast is one of Hallmark Production's trademarks and this film was no exception. Cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
