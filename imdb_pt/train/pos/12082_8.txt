Having watched this movie strictly with the strength of the reviewers' reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. Although clearly low-budget, it presents the signs of clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I find myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced by an external photo focused on her face and then moving back to include the house and its isolated location. And behold! the next scene was just the last scene of the house standing alone on the cliff by the water's edge. There are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very nice thriller. Experienced viewers will certainly recognize them, but make sure they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> As for performances, George Macready is his scary self, barely maintaining composure and suggesting an unadulterated capacity for violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the hardworking girl who does not submit to submit without a fight. But Give me May Witty, oh boy, she even made me doubt my own eyes and believe she could get away with her evil schemes. <br /> <br /> This is a real gross and unmissable diamond.
