I'm glad users (as of this date) who liked this movie are now performing. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - it looks like they were expecting serious treatment (?!?!?!)! Come on, how the hell can you take seriously the premise of a killer snowman? The filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they did not try to deny it. The direct delivery of scenes really makes the movie FUNNY! Yes, there are times when the low budget shows (like that bursting scene), but I think an expensive look would have taken the fun out of the movie! So, if you like B movies, and the silly premise appeals to you, then you surely will like "Jack Frost."
