There are many reasons to watch this film: see the reality that lashes Latin America in relation to kidnappings, police corruption on the continental level, among so many realities that we live the Latins. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this guy remains an excellent actor and continues like this. Dakota Fanning just 10 years ago, an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was wonderful, I have in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they have happened to Hollywood producers to make a film completely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better with regard to delinquency, drug trafficking or political problems. There were few films that play in Venezuelan lands (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) they should do more, just like they do in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope it comes out on the soundtrack, it's great. My vote is 10/10
