"The day is over" is an incredible image. in a way, better than "close encounters of the third type." (I prefer indecent independent films for big budget shows.) The special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an outstanding performance in this film. is probably one of the best roles he has ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story does not make sense. BUT IT MAKES MORE INTRIGENANT. like many of the best works of art, "the day is over" is not afraid of being subtle and ambiguous. "the day is over" may be an independent low-budget film, but it is not very difficult to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were independent, low-budget productions).
