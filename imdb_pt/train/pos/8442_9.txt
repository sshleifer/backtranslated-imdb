The film was excellent, except for some of the scenes with Esposito. I liked how he gathered all the detectives in the series, and I finalized some plots that were never solved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together in their most humane and most basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual they will be forgotten. It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide. Souvenirs, tapes and reruns on CourtTV are not the same as watching them every Friday. But the film did its job and did very well, presenting a great representation of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I really enjoyed it.
