Kim Novak is a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover, and James Stewart is her choice. Scintillating comedy comedy, from the Broadway stage; filmed by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and played by a cast of pounds sterling. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually disheveled writer Redlitch. I love this movie, although few others seem. Kim alone makes a winner in my book. There is! My Movie # 5 of 1958.
