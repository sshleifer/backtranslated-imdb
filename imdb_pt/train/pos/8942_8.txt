A number of employees mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I guess the difference did not matter to a suspense drama like Vertigo, but it matters for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it is less clear why hers would be drawn to him. <br /> <br /> Still, the film works as a mild romantic fantasy. The scene in which she looks at him from the other side of the cat's head, with dark painted eyebrows and the sounds of her buzzing and purring cat, is the real magic. It's a bit shocking, so when the scene changes to the top of the Flatiron Building, we see the age difference very sharply. When he hugs her, she reaches his fingers through her hair, but stops that movement and just runs her fingers lightly against his wig.
