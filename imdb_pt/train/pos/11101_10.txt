The sopranos were probably the last best show to be shown in the 90's. Sadly it turned out, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV, not everything was spelled for you at all you had to think about, it was brilliant. the cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and played his excellent character, just like the others. Each character had flaws, which made them so real and allowed viewers to connect with them, and that was one of the reasons that lasted so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to pick up many different things that can be interpreted by the final id as thinking that Tony did not die, but Prado came in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense. Tony will have to go to trial and deal with it, I hope he's not dead, that's how I feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
