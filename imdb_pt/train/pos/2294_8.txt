... Hawk Heaven for lovers of French cinema and, by extension, French actors and movie stars. At worst, it's an indulgence, actors begin to complain about other actors, question the validity of acting like a profession, etc., while at its best, it's a glorious celebration of some of the best actors who are currently working. From a simple premise - Jean-Pierre Marielle's request for water to be ignored in a restaurant - Blier spins in all directions and allows the cream of French cinema to parade its things before even waving to those who are not (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura), including the director's father, Bernard, one of the great faithful of French cinema, of whom he makes a celestial phone call at the end of the film. Discursive and wordy, yes, guilty as an accused, but also as a guilty pleasure.
