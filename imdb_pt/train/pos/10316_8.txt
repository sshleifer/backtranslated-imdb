Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a boy preparing for the day of the examination, the state i.q test. The boy is somewhat intrigued by the anxiety of his parents, since some of his friends have already done so and eventually goes out to take the test. When he arrives, he receives an injection and is curious to know why. The examiner smiles and says it's just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, intrigued again, why not? It is later and parents are sitting anxiously waiting by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state is sorry, but your child's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and asked politely if they would like a private burial. A steed from a conclusive scene! Message From Charity was an exciting story about a mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. That makes a strange history of accusations of witchcraft in the past and plunges into the history pages of the present. A good story with a cheery conclusion.
