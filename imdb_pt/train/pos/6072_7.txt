Branagh and Fishburne offer great performances in this version of Shakespeare's classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the character played in the movie or on the stage. Some may say that this film is overly focused on Iago, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of cinema ironically, offers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the Moor of Venice may be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of several important scenes. The character of Desdemona receives much less depth than in the play. In this movie, it also may not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child who is portrayed as in this movie. There were several subtractions that undermined the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the piece, or seen a film version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, cut off or not, is still incredibly captivating. The performance, as said before, is very good. If some important scenes were added, and the character of Desdemona was prioritized a little more, this would be a great movie. As it stands, it's still an admirable version of the original. I give a marginal recommendation.
