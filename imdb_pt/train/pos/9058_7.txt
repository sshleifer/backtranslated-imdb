I read the book in 5th grade and now, a few years later, I saw the movie. There are some differences: 1.Billy supposedly should eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in a day until 7 at night. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after he ate all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe must fake some of the worms, but in the movie, he does nothing. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this film is still one of the children will like.
