I do not know what the previous reviewer was watching but I guess that's what the reviews are, personal taste. Lost in this movie was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, affecting. Undercurrents of love retained because of submission to social beliefs, taboos of the times and classes, racial relations not being in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hate, confusion, very dark emotionally I thought, under the skin, you have to submit to his air, a fluent film, not slow as said before, free yourself to the flow of the film, the emotions will show, the characters will reveal their flaws, their unpleasant, excellent and really very cruel bowels!
