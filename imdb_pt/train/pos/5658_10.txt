This was one of the best shows ever made for TV. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive viewing. I was lucky to have seen this in the UK. They may have missed the order of the episodes, I do not remember, but at least it happened at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got hooked on the trailer, and neither of us is a big fan of the American series normally. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and crazy for a week losing those lol. <br /> <br /> Great cast, excellent acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black performed in an incredible performance for a child, and Paige Turco was at his best since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy, of course, as the sheriff's long-running companion. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and confusing pieces, which I presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. . That made the ending weak, and you could say they killed him. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do it with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.
