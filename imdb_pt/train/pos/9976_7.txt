Of course, it was tacky and tasteless and sometimes tacky, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most TV movies border on mediocrity, this movie does have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was very good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen displays Aragorn's tones in a movie about a man who played by his own rules. Most of the flashback sequences were kind of tacky, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was kind of upset about the role of Jason Priestly in the movie as a rebel-shock, but again, it's a TV MOVIE! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona featured in the movie.
