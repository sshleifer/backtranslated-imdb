The only thing about this movie that baffles me is that the DVD is so expensive. It's a lot for my budget right now, or I would buy because the film is a good example of film noir ... and I like to watch Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces great DVDs, but sometimes the asking price is a little too much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white mono movie that's good, but nothing extraordinary, cinematic. <br /> <br /> History is history here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a beater (Widmark), inadvertently ends up with spy microfilm in his possession after stealing purse of Peters. (Say this three times!). All but Peters are compelling characters in this film: Widmark, the cops, the US agents and the Communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe," an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this movie. Peters does a decent job of playing cheap cheap but loses credibility early on by "falling in love" with Widmark in the first meeting, though it is unpleasant. to her. Only in the movie world !! Too bad, because this ridiculous novel is part of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a medium noir movie that means good but not great and certainly not worth buying at a price of $ 25- $ 35. For that price, you can do a lot better at noir film market.
