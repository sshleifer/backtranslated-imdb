I thought the Ice Age was a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman childless, I still seem to really like these humorous and witty animated films. Sid is the best character I've seen in a while, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really funny, and I did not think his character could be even or even defeated) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I've seen the movie at least 15 times (I obviously own it) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to find out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers" ... "Pack of wolves, flock of bears, flock of fleas, flock of mustaches, pack of noses, drunk, pack of lies , pack a problem, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish ... "or meanwhile that part goes! This is the funniest part of the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humor behind" put sloths on the map "and many other parts as well.The only animated movie that can be compared remotely to the Ice Age is" Brother Bear ".
