A long time fan of Bette Midler, I must say that her live shows are my favorites. Bette thrilled us with her jokes and brought us to tears with her ballads. A literal rainbow of emotion and talent, Bette shows us the best of her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Covering generations of people, it offers something for everyone. The first and only Divine Diva proves that she is the most talented artist in the world.
