I rented this movie because of my interest in American history and especially the rather strange story of the Mormons. This film tries to make some sense of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a great world religion. He first focuses on the problems that the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the judgment of Joseph Smith. In the course of this judgment, Brigham Young stands to report his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in Smith's spiritual message. So Smith is murdered, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he was chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his serious doubts, he perseveres and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the righteousness of his leadership. Later, when crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts he was truly chosen - yet a miracle occurs, which cemented his place in history. <br /> <br /> I thought the performances were moving, and the story is compelling and interesting. I would love to know if Mormons believe this is an accurate portrait. Polygamy is a part of history, but the reasons why this is critical to LDS are not raised. The point is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of their religious affair, but have a great cast and will keep their interest everywhere.
