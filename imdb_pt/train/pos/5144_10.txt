This very strange movie is unlike anything made in the West at the time. With its tumultuous emotions and network of visions, dreams and amazing images, its effect is beautiful and disturbing. Actors are choreographed more like dancing than acting. It contains the only sequence of dreams I know that really looks like a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
