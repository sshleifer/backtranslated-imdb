It is a real shame that this TV series inspired by the TV images made for the TV "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because at best this program offered a frequency A mixture winning and highly entertaining cynical humor (Carl Kolchak's verbal bouts with perpetually irascible and suffering editor Tony Vincenzo have always been a treat to watch and listen to), clever writing, cool supernatural threats (you love the original and unusual creatures) in " The Spanish Sentry "and" Horror in the Heavens ", plus you can not go wrong with fright favorites, such as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches, colorful characters lively acting from a series of cool guests (the legendary motorcycle icon William Smith had a rare chance of facing a heroic lead in "The Energy Eater" while other episodes featured great action veterans such as Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden, and William Daniels in succulent roles), genuine moments of genuine suspense (the climax of "Spanish moss wasting" in particular was really distressing), and, best of all, the first and only Darren. McGavin, in his peak form as the impetuous, aggressive and excitable but basically decent, brave and honest little reporter from Chicago, Illinois, Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the protagonist everyman of the 1970s par excellence. Clever and insightful companion with a strong nose for a tasty spoon and an inopportune ability to indulge in all sorts of problems. In addition, occasionally clumsy Kolchak was nothing superhuman; he usually stumbled or stumbled as he ran away from a mortal threat, still possessed a certain strength and inner courage that allowed him to save the human race from time to time from all kinds of supernatural and lethal enemies. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of pleasant side characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's chronically grumpy boss Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as the meticulous Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic, Ruth McDevitt was simply charming as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles and Carol Ann Susi was equally as entertaining as eager beaver debutant Monique Marmelstein (who disappeared after appearing in only three episodes). Granted, the show suffered from lackluster make-up and special effects (the titular lycanthropist in "The Werewolf" sadly resembles a Yorkshire terrier!) And the later episodes boasted some ridiculously silly monsters (the headless motorcyclist in "Chopper", Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in "The Youth Killer"), but even second-rate shows are redeemed by McGavin's trademark, perversely malicious, sardonic, and unlimited vitality program and its engaging presence.
