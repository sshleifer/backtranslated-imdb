I saw this movie for the first time when I was 6 or 7 and I really did not think it was anything special. As time went by, I watched a few more times and started to grow in me as I began to understand the moral of the film, which I will come later. For a while I left this movie alone and did not watch for a while. When looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (now 15), I took the VHS back home. After watching this, I stayed in a natural high that I could not really explain. The film gives a feeling of joy that you never expect. The nature of the films of three completely different animals that collaborate together to find the way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are, you can always find common ground, something that you all need. The way the characters' personalities are chosen is truly fantastic. As long as you have an old golden retriever experienced wise, take care of or guide 'chance' the fun loving if a young American bulldog slightly clumsy, with daring the intelligent, vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible that it creates magic in which you begin to believe that this journey can happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies, I assure you that I am the exact opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is undoubtedly the return of the shadows, when the shadow tries desperately to escape and the chance and bold, painfully tell themselves by him to leave. When the two animals return to their beloved owners, there is silence until the shadow penetrates the horizon to the fear of all. There is a fine line between the corny and tacky trash, but this movie is pure magic even at the age of 15. This movie may not be the Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to rise the way it does, even at that age, it deserves 10/10.
