I loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors. But for me, Davis's very poor attempt to accent, and his tough acting really makes a film otherwise very difficult to watch. Seriously, if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Miss. Davis, they laughed at the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think she 'phoned that one.' Now, had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman played the role of the wife, I would have liked it much more. <br /> <br /> I think I just do not "understand" Bette Davis. I always thought of her as an actor who "interprets herself" no matter what role she is in. The possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I'm sure many of the other reviewers will carefully explain (and hopefully civil) detail how totally I am wrong about this. But, I'll continue to watch the movies she's in because I like stories / writers / supporting cast, but I'll always be thinking about different actresses who might have done a better job.
