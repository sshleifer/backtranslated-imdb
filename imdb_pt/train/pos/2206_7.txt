Do not believe all the negative comments this movie gets. Yes, it's cheap. Yes, the blood is laughable. And, yes, the performance is insignificant. However, this is an example textbook for an early slasher film, and if that's your "thing" (it's mine!), Then you'll enjoy this. There are good enough aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the disadvantages. On the one hand, the score of a then-unknown Christopher Young is very scary and accentuates the violence perfectly. The ending is a welcome break from the upbeat and predictable endings of most movies. And last but not least, the setting is what made the movie for me. The creators of this movie could have done a much better job "dressing" the set to make it more credible as a college dormitory. However, if you can ignore this failure, the configuration is fine. Four colleges alone in an immense abandoned building condemned waiting to be knocked over ... is a possibility. While watching, let your imagination be part of the work and you can enjoy this movie as much as I do.
