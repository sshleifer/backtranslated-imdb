I found this movie very funny, I loved how modern sports politics was. This movie is not as funny as the South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I loved how they entertained some of the most ridiculous things in sports. This movie is great for non-sports lovers too, probably better for them, actually because they have to go through life asking why people follow sports so close when there are so many insane and intricate rules for sports and the fact that that means absolutely nothing. I also found the actual game they created to be interesting, is a kind of horse with bases and psyche outputs (for the person who is shooting). Overall I recommend you watch this movie, and I believe you will end up loving this movie. However, if this comedy style is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but this is with any comedy movie)
