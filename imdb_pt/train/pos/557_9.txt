As I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed by the scenery, I can not help wishing that this movie, although it has beautiful colors and panoramic views would have been filmed at the actual location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place but it is still not the real place where the movie happens. When the story moves to Dawson, it's when I feel Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor venues so well, could have done his best if he filmed the actual place. James Stewart here is again a man struggling within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who prevent him from making money, and the other side simply is not able to look away from people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care who she steps on, Corinne Calvet is the cool girl. Mann is excellent at directing the shootings, but the highlight of the film is how well he does in the outside scenes. He uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scene, the predominant white, as it was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the browns in "The Man From Laramie." Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
