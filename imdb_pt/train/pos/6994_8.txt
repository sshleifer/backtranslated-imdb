Bela made 9 photos for Monogram, but it was only in that, the 4th, that things started to come together. The rest of the series would use this as the essential model for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the series would also deal with an essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) experiments in the basement or the old house (sometimes in the basement of the old house) that makes things go gloomy. This was also the first time that art director Dave Milton had a chance to spread his wings. He came aboard BLACK DRAGONS, the movie before, but this is where he begins to make his ship start clicking. Lewis created a great atmosphere for almost nothing, and was around for the rest of the Monograms. Casting is the key in them, and it's a good movie B here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who would star in Lewtons' CAT PEOPLE films ... and Rosewo from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a good slice of Poverty Row's talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... summarize everything they have learned so far, and give you something to compare the rest. The plot? Bela steals the juice from the gland to keep her nasty young wife. Both like sleeping in coffins. If you can read this and smile, the rest will be easy.
