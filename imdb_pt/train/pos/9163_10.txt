When my daughter, now of school age, was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A & E from 8 to 9 o'clock in the morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would not miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning all week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten how much I loved this movie until I took my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, steely face, imperious behavior tempered with humor and tenderness came straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton ate some scenery, I could not watch an adaptation starring William Hurt or Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get involved in romance. <br /> <br /> I would love to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She's dead like Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with just one look. The gleam in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the force and witty nature that helped Jane survive the ill-treatment she suffered as a youth. Critique of its performance as "wood" is shifted. A maid in a proper English home would have maintained exactly such behavior, but she speaks passionately when taken in with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she seems clear enough to be Jane, but beautiful enough to allow the public to buy the Rochester lure for her. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue is a big part of why the book persists. of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interaction between Jane and Rochester with intelligence and quiet intensity. Although Jane looks as simple and sweet as vanilla cream, she refuses to be intimidated by the gloomy and stormy Rochester. The two leaders play against each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance of all time.
