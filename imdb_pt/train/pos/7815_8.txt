'Cry Freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth. The first half is an interesting portrait of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and editor Don Woods (played fanatically by Dezel). Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods looking for answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people prefer the first half of the film, which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. I found the second half about Don Woods fighting to have the story of Biko being heard all over the world much more interesting.
