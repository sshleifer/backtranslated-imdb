I did not read anything about the film before I happened to see it last Saturday night. And then, as I watched, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the footage that I listened only partially to the dialogues. My husband slept shortly after we went to bed and I was not sleeping under the impact of the movie. I wanted to wake him up just to say, "If I were to vote for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. So I read more about the movie in IMDb, and I was sad to hear that Mr. Berry died before the movie was released and that he probably had never seen the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that for me his film was a true independent film, in its concept and spirit. Actors should be commended not only for their brilliant performance, but for accepting a dull, unposted part, rather on the contrary, exhibiting the true image of human depression. Sad but moving.
