The people who produced this masterful film did a good job for a novel that is perhaps the best work of fiction centered on human guilt and human responsibility already published. Nolte assumes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and becomes his, remaining faithful to the representation of Vonnegut of a man who lost EVERYONE (for and) by Love. <br /> <br /> No weaknesses in this good adaptation.
