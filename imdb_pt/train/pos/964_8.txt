"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit gloomy and scary for the younger ones. However, older children may well eat this, that is, if you play in English. <br /> <br /> The story is of a boy, who moved with his mother to the countryside, to live with his grandfather, after a divorce. During a village festival the boy is chosen as a "knight Kirin", a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the deeds of evil are as close as a woman. in a white miniskirt, go-go boots and beehive hairstyle, joins an evil Yokai to turn people's resentments and discard them. And this evil manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster headed for the City of Fury itself, Tokyo. A pretty funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city ... says one, "Oh, it's just Gamera." <br /> <br /> The young man became friends with Yokai, who are monstrous, mostly benign, who isolated themselves from humans, and all Yokai in Japan unite to fight against evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways Miike & crew took the Yokai movies of the late 60s and early 70s and turned them into a modern action-adventure movie for children (older) that also combines some strangers mechanical monsters that made me think of "Transformers." The look and feel of the movie is great, the effects are fun, and some of the humor just goes over the heads of the kids, but even so, the older ones might like that. As for adults, there's not much here to dislike, if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun things, kind of dark sometimes. but maybe it's just Miike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
