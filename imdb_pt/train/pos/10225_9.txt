I have a good laugh reading all the idiot comments for this movie, as it is obvious that those people who criticized the film have never seen or been stupid enough to pay to see it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was on Elvira's show a few years ago. Elvira delivered the film with as many laughs as possible. <br /> <br /> It's a monster movie, compared to the hundreds of horrendous American movies made. Much better!!!!
