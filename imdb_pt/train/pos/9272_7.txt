This was the first of the Panahi movies I saw, I saw at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was totally absorbed by the different characters he creates and how different they react and behave compared to the Australian boys and yet on other levels as similarly. I think if more people could watch movies like that, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown. There are the obvious big political differences between the Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I have found the subtler differences between the characters that this film develops so well on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem so singular to me. I thought this made the characters appealing.
