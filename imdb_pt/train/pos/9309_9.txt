Dear God, where do I begin. This is the bar none the best movie I have ever seen. the camera angles are great, but in my opinion, the acting was the best. Why the writers of this movie are not writing big budget movies that I will never understand. another is the cast. that's great. This is the best Raimi Ted movie out there, for sure. I know some of you out there are probably thinking "no way he has much better" but not his wrong. The island of the raptor is a work of art. I hope it was the best movie of the year instead of that low quality Crash movie with a lot of no names and no kidnappers. I believe this movie is really the most wonderful thing ever.
