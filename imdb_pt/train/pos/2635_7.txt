My Take: A funny version of THE LION KING, posing as a sequel. Surprisingly fun. Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another direct video for the video, which is worth a theatrical treatment. I do not see why Disney has thrown it straight into the video and cast bad films like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" in theaters. These movies are best seen in video stores (in the area of ​​"new releases") rather than watching their theatrical posters outside theaters. <br /> <br /> This is just a parody of the first movie (although the events in "Simba's Pride" have yet to happen, in Timon's (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella) point of view. Original voices from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their voice roles in the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give a hilarious comedy as Timon's mother and his grumpy uncle. <br /> <br /> So, that does not sound like fun.Maybe not now, but go watch for yourself.Not being so serious in your plot makes it more enjoyable. It's like the MST3000 with Timon and Pumba. <br /> <br /> Movie rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
