This silent gem sung tells the true story of a prisoner of war escape during World War II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is ingenious and sounds very true. In fact, an unusual general authenticity puts that head and shoulders above most war epics.
