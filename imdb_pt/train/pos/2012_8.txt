This is one of my all time favorites. Great music and some funny bits. I giggle every time at Millie, the maid pretending to be a debunker, holding her delicate handkerchief while chatting, polishing furniture without thinking as she talks. I can never overcome her French accent never being a problem, as they try to pass through her as the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> Watching a teenager Mel Torme and young Frank Sinatra singing is a great pleasure. My mom saw Frank Sinatra in a theater around the same time this movie came out. She said they could not wipe the "bobby-soxers" between the movies (in those days you did not have to leave between presentations). This film shows how attractive and attractive the young Frank was and allows him to appreciate his first talents as well. And Victor Borge goes into a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet and simple storyline. Very enjoyable.
