I really like this movie because in Australia such Chinese movies are never shown during prime time. I must say that this is one of the most serious films of all time, which describes the difference between the people of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. This really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but can only improve when HK is learning Mandarin. It also showed me how in mainland China the indie rock scene exists, and that the Chinese know how to strum the guitar and make the house shake! Who says China is not ready for rock? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his clean, crisp voice, honest acting and a total magnet for girls. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about Asian people purifying themselves of typical Western stereotypes, and people who love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Check out!
