I had seen this movie a long time ago, but I found it incredible and until today it never stopped surprising me. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film depicting an account of a group of Australian commandos who attempted to sink Japanese ships into the port of Singapore during the height of World War II. <br /> <br /> These commands are captured in ordinary clothes and are considered spies by the Japanese captors. But something happens that was not much explored in any Hollywood World War II movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> A close and friendly bond develops between the captors and the captives. They begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes the best of the friends of a high Japanese guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and really pulls your heart out. <br /> <br /> Soon one day while the two friends are talking, the Australian captain learns that some other captives will be tried. executed for the sinking of Japanese ships in the port of Singapore. He mentions that it was his team and not a few others who had sunk the ships to his Japanese friend, and upon hearing this, the Japanese guard told him to be quiet as he could take his entire group to be executed. But the captain remains adamant in confessing that to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respectful way that conforms to their rules. This is the highest honor bestowed on captured warriors in Japan. This is the most impressive part of the film, where Australian soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is still is not ready to believe that why his Australian friend confessed to being guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending here. But it is more pungent than you can imagine and can easily lead to tears. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent underrated film that possibly did not get the recognition it deserved internationally. Get a copy today and get hypnotized.
