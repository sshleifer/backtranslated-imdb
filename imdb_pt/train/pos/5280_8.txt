Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. Out of nowhere, his father announces that Reda will take him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something that Reda has no interest in doing, but agrees only with obligation. As a result, from the outset, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim man, his father is difficult to talk or discuss his doubts. Both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it is very ironic when the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other. However, I do not really think they did and that's the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Of course, there were moments of understanding, but often there was a current of hostility and repression. I really liked that and I appreciated that there was no complete resolution of it - as it would have seemed false. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is well represented and fascinating - giving Westerners an unusual insight into Islam. and Hajj. It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may irritate some, I think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a movie about people - not some formula. A nice and unusual film.
