There is much to love in this little and beloved comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a home, or even has little space, will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in Mr. Blanding's difficult situation. Melvin Douglas, with great comedic outburst, both narrate and act like the lawyer of Blandings and the voice of reason. Well Myrna Loy is in her best shape as a rather daunting but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is that of Grant. He is the common American man, especially relevant at the time of the release of this film, when the nation was under control of a housing deficit after the end of the war. The themes are universal, lack of money, tension at work, fear of infidelity. Yes, it involves very well, but you should keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. It's still relevant today, and I have to record the bad reviews I see to a current preference for silly and crude comedies. The look of the film is smooth, and there are some good comedy excerpts, particularly in relation to the beginning. Although it may have lost some social relevance, almost sixty years after launch, it is still a jewel.
