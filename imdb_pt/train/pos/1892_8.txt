After seeing Arthur on TV several times, I laughed so hard that the role of Dudley Moore as Arthur was a drunken, lucky, hysterical millionaire, but John Gielgud as his father figure Hobson was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched it despite the passage of almost 27 years is still as enjoyable as it was always the role of Liza Minnelli as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like national debt that he has no desire to grow and likes to act like a child. His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud), it seems that no one really cares about Arthur except for him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry the terrible blonde socialite Susan Johnson Eikenberry) in four. weeks he will cut his son's $ 750 million inheritance. <br /> <br /> However Arthur knows and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young waitress and thief of the working class, now faces a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and breaks up with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep the money and his true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a truly charming romantic comedy for everyone.
