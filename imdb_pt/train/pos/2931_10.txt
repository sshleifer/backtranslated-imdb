Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw it about 2 years ago I was in stitches for weeks afterwards. To this day I've seen 17 more times and I still laugh every time. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedian before being a Hollywood star. There is no annoying point in this piece of genius unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987, which stretches in between. If you are not the type of person who can not be cursing then I would not advise you to see it as you will probably hear cursing somehow every 5-10 seconds. I gave this 10 out of 10 because it shows the best comic genius of all of them at their best.
