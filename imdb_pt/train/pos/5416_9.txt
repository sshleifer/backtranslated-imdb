I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven, the movie 13. We were so young ... But I kept in mind, for ever, the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I realized how long a people can hardly be subjected to and used by a foreign nation. In these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that is ignored, that which is made between people who share daily life, who see each other, who know each other, but belong to different worlds. , can only appear. Then, in the most critical moments, a disturbing question arises: "To whom should we first be loyal?" What people, family, homeland, the person you know near you? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, urgency exists, and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself. Somewhere, in a confused way, a problem remains unresolved, emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities that we can see today, because that death, that disappearance single life I lived, I shared with my son unconditional friendship. It was lived by the spectator that I was. That day I lost Gunga-Din forever. As I left behind, later, my childhood, when I left so many worlds in which I lived. I left all this forever and these lines are a short visit today that I did not expect to do this morning when I got up.
