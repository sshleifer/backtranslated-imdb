My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this movie. The viewer is swept from modern life to old Japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes. The characters are realistic and detailed; has an unpredictable ending and story, which is very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-tangles within the lives of several geishas living together in a poor town district. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a real life novel or life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
