Despite reading the "opening remarks" from someone who curiously did not like the movie - (WHY IS THE ONLY FIRST NEGATIVE COMMENT ON THE LIST?) It was great to note that pretty much everyone loved it! Obviously, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - that's the whole idea. And, in fact, those points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but despite this, and all the terrible negative attempts by the adversary, he showed how he was able to complete a remarkable work given by God. I would recommend it to anyone!
