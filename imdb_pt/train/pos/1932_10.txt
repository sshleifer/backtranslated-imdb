I think I usually approach movie festival comedies with the low expectation that they are invariably "quirky," and that any intended mood will be derived only at the cost of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding humor in the scene after scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps due also partly to the sharp work of the DP, I rarely saw in an indie film, and even more rarely in a comedy. Of special note here: the turn of Paget Brewster as Amy, the math teacher. After seeing this performance, I can not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a larger audience. It brings the necessary mixture of anger and sympathy to the role that really helps that image to reach its potential. This is a great job that deserves a larger audience. I look forward to more of the director and this cast!
