Cute movie about three living Swiss sisters (often seen running in matching clothes) who want to reunite their parents (it seems that the mother is still carrying the torch for the father) - then they leave for New York to prevent the father from getting married a golden blond that he calls "precious." Daddy has not seen his daughters for ten years, they (strangely) do not seem to care and think he's wonderful, and while Precious seems to lead a life driven primarily by his domineering mother (Alice Brady), a woman who eventually wants to do with May your daughter marry a rich man. The sisters have the idea of ​​pushing Precious into the path of a drunken Hungarian earl, fooling the two gold diggers into thinking he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think that the count is the well-known Ray Milland, who agrees to the scheme because he has a crush on Sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is nice and light. Barbara Lido as Kay looks sweet and handsome, Ray Milland looks so young and handsome here (though, sadly, given little to do), Alice Brady is very good as the intriguing mother - but it's Deanna Durbin, a true charming and cute as a button playing little sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings a lot of songs throughout the film, although I liked to have seen them even more in her. The plot in this movie is a bit silly, but nevertheless, I found the film fun and entertaining.
