2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It's official; "Takashi Miike" is defeated. <br /> <br /> The annual midnight screening of the new movie "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it what you want, this is a fanatic ride. Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer said that this film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. After the screening, I can understand where they were going with it, but, after all, this is "Takashi Miike". He directed the film "Ichi the Killer", 2001, when the display at the festival of banners was distributed on display. And no, this was not just a marketing move. Plot Summary: A boy with a troubled family life becomes "chosen", and he stumbles in the middle of a war of the Great Spirit, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions during his journey. <br /> <br /> This is not for children, nor for young people. Certainly watching them become terrified with some of these (even the friendly) spirits on display. This is unlike anything I've seen in movies before. A fantasy of course, a very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored you can guarantee this. Will this hit North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
