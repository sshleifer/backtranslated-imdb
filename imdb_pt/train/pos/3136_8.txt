A strangely nice effort, combining an appropriately forced plot involving Adam and Burt and flashbacks from the original TV series. Most of the flashbacks were taken directly from Burt Ward's book, "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights," and I imagine your book was the inspiration for making this movie. Like the book, it left fans of the original series hungry for more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it's definitely worth the effort to get a tape from a friend that you may have recorded. I'm making a copy for my kids now.
