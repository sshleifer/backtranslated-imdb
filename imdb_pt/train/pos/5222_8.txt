After Chicago, I was starting to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then came The Flock. There is until now a beautiful smile and a couple of facial gestures can get you, but it has proved to me that he has finally taken his craft and can act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also super as her "trainee / substitute". Some have suggested that there has been a lot of unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing I saw undermined the power of this film. I was really shocked, I had not heard of being released in theaters and I found it on Blockbuster. Really an exceptional film with the right blend of action, suspense, emotion and social awareness. As good as 7even? Well, maybe. And you'll see Gere's better performance than anyone else has ever left Pitt.
