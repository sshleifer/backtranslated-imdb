Page 3 is definitely a captivating and captivating eye opener that cleverly exposes the hypocritical lifestyle of the Mumbai elite. From the fake kisses to the smiles plastered, he leaves no stone unturned as he reveals the shocking lives of the rich and famous. Stabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glamor. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the predominant mentality. Everyone is constantly looking for more money, more fame and a greater reputation, leading them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing movie contracts at a funeral to molest children. Everything is possible in this metropolis, where there is such a gap between social classes. The public sees the ugliness of both classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She notices the suffocating atmosphere and hallucinating frenzy in which the socialites live. Bollywood, business magnates, politicians, and the underworld are all entwined in a completely complicated mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a great track, as is the vigorous Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Fantastic movie with excellent character development!
