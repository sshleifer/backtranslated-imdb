The end of the season sent mixed messages, felt feelings of joy and also feelings of lying and cheating. Roseanne tells all the viewers that the whole nine season was a lie because her husband, Dan, had died. She also admits that the family never won the lottery, and that season 9 was a lie just as she wanted it or wanted it to be. I'm still confused about when she said that Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit to being pregnant. So I believe it's exactly how she wanted it to be, but it was not. So the end of the season was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
