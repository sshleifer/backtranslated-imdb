I have at least blatantly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and I hope the writers strike does not end brutally with the start of a really good show. Ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his unique quirks, as his love for knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is the childhood friend who was once the dead-but-no-longer and the sunny spot in Ned's life. Olive is the waitress jealous, but good-hearted. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson, along with Olive and occasionally the dog, solve various murder mysteries with the help of Ned's special gift of bringing dead people back to life. The show is funny, clean and romantic in a very cute and kind-hearted way, and I recommend it to everyone.
