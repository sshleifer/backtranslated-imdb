Do not listen to the many acerbic and ridiculous comments that pile up on this movie ... simply, as far as ninja movies are concerned, my friends are as good as he gets! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, yes, the acting and script are admittedly atrocious, but for chewing gum - it's a lot of fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the horrendous 'acting' (which in the case of the movie in question, is actually one of the worst I've ever had the joy of watching!) And ridiculous 'plot' actually only serve to raise the level of pleasure ten times. Obviously, the fight scenes are the main attraction and, for the most part, I am pleased to say that they are very well choreographed, especially the final confrontation (during which we witnessed that the ninjas are not ostensibly limited by the normal laws of gravity ...) <br /> <br /> Trust me, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen Sakura Killers then you are really missing out on what is, in my opinion, one of the real jewels of the crown of the genre.
