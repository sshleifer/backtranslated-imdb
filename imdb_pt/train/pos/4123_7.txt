The freedom to have your own Sea Going Power Boat, the excitement of underwater adventures, an adventurous man and adorable (and so well endowed!) Wizards in fine bikinis were all definite outlets for "SEA HUNT" (1958 -61). <br /> <br /> Exactly what was the reason for producing a kind of series of "rented yachts" for the sea. Let's look closely now. There must be some clues around. <br /> <br /> If we were to look a little behind, we would see UNDERWATER's production of RKO Radio Pictures! (1955). It starred Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive stand-alone Scuba Adventurers working on rescue in the Caribbean, including a Cuba Pre-Fidel. The film had a moderate success and was memorable not necessarily for its history, as for the appearance of the directors in bathing suits. Fine, shapely Women Folk in some 2-piece swimsuits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always an advantage for the Guys; and the presence of rude, athletic men exhibiting their best steak "poses" is equally enjoyable for the Gals. <br /> <br /> And there is one element that is a true legacy of this old RKO Feature. It is on the soundtrack contained between the musical queues and the themes. It's the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White," written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and played by Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (with lyrics) will not soon forget. His Carribbean Beat is very lively and his rich use of the Orchestra's Brass Section is Powerful and instantly provides instant printing and memory. The 45 RPM album of this song reached the Top 10 of the most popular Songs of the Week for many Saturday nights on NBC TV's "YOUR HIT PARADE" program. We can not remember how many weeks or how high it came. (Maybe someone can fill us in on that item, please!) So, we went back to "SEA HUNT" and his own odyssey to get into "The Tube". The crowd had taken it underground! Alright, but they would go for a TV series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions was gaining a reputation for launching a type of product that, for the most part, was not signed by the Networks. for multi-station connection handling. But they were having great successes with Television Syndication. ** By this, we mean, offer a series of stations for one-to-one TV station viewing by market area. (Just as the various Newspaper Syndicates "sell" comics to various newspapers across the country, and even the world. So we have "Mike Nelson" himself, in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges has been around for about 15 years or more and has performed some memorable performances in supporting and highly varied roles in some Boston Blackie films (with Chester Morris) for THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges, 1943 (1943), and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought a very convincing way for his characterization, along with a convincing physique, and athletic, having the look of a guy who earns his living with his physical abilities. He did very well as the Diver's Diver, whether performing tasks aboard ships, or fathoms under the Sea. <br /> And Lloyd did take over the paper quickly, but contrary to much misinformation out there, he was not f acquainted with SCUBA *** before landing this show Mike Nelson. But the athlete Mr. Bridges proved to be a quick learner, since many of the underwater close-ups revealed that there was no doubt about it, that it was Lloyd with the mask, the bubbler (air tank) and the flipper fins. . <br /> <br /> Stories almost always involved helping a paying customer, as a private detective would. And if the client were a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit, so much the better. Like so many other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV productions, "SEA HUNT" had a fine, haunting the opening and closing theme along with some original by-laws and lines. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I believe that "SEA HUNT" was the top syndicated TV series, a hit that the ZIV series had previously met with the likes of "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "ROAD PATROL" . As for the venue of this underwater saga, here in Chicago was shown late at night (after 10:30 pm) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC Affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I can only remember who was the original sponsor in this particular market was. And there were even scene commercials made by Star! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, riding his Power Boat. And as we were being invited to come back next week and watch "..... another adventure from" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin 'the creators of Old Style Lager Beer!', All while Mike was toasting us, picking up an Old Style Bottle. (What a shame for you, Mike!) Drinking beer on your moving boat! We're telling the Coast Guard!) Then the boat would leave the dock, accompanied by the Sea Hunting Theme and rolling the Credits. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literal, Mike was hired and things ran much like a Detective Story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ZIV's successes include "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WESTERN POINT" (and its "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS" clone), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And, of course, SCUBA is an acronym for Self-contained Underwater Respiratory System.
