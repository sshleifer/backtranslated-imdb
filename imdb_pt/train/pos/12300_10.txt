This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all the other characters have different actors than the English version. Both were filmed back to back, because Garbo had such a string in Germany. Garbo supposedly favored Anna Christie in this version on the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.
