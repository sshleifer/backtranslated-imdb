I have watched this movie so many times through my childhood that to this day I can practically re-see the whole dialogue. And when I watch now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laughs. I find it incredible how they managed to train animals, especially the cat, as far as they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However watching now I can also unfortunately note that it is not the masterpiece that I thought it was. But I'd rather remember how I felt about it when I was younger watching on VHS on my TV fist that would darken the image in yellow. And given that it's a children's movie, that's why I'd still give it 10/10 definitely.
