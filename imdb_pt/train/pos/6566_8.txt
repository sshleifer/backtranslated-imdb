Have you ever wondered where ideas for novels and other articles come from? According to 'Jake Speed' they are based on real people, living the adventures they write and publish. This movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence and tiny clothes at worst. Language is not a problem either, and jokes are funny on all levels. This is an 'Austin Powers' look at 'Indian Jones' without the over-the-top antics of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this movie for kids in the range of 10 to 15.
