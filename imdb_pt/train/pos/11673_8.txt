Having seen Charley Boorman on the Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would be at his own show. I thought Charley came as an adorable guy who is very grounded and down to earth. It's good to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, just show off their human too! I do not know much about motorcycles, but this show has grabbed me from the start. The preparation and organization of this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and I'm fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else are doing it and how far it arrives. I love the rhythm of the show and the fast and optimistic music. I can not believe he broke his collarbone, I really hope it's not the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
