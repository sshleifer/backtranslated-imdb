An incredible English film for so many reasons. First, it is a rare appearance of Laurence Olivier in a mild comedy. While his performance is not the standard he would have as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly believable as the duped lawyer. Historically this film is of great interest because of where and when it was filmed. Being English, it did not have the big budget of the films of Hollywood of the same time and often is exhibited, but the most interesting thing is that the film was filmed shortly before the war and to show an England that soon would disappear. When we watch today, we think in terms of modern morality and note the fact that this film and its closest American film, "It Happened One Night," were in their day as daring as "Fatal Instinct" in our day. But after watching and enjoying this movie the first time, I can not help feeling sad when I watch it today. With half of the filming before the 1950s, saving the remaining films means difficult choices, and unfortunately movies like this are often passed on to save movies that we all consider important. Color change, lack of contrast, and the generally low quality of the most often seen print are heart-breaking. This film, along with `It Happened One Night ', is perfect for snuggling with a love under a blanket on a cool cool evening, or better yet, why not a double feature.
