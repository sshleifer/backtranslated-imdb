A real classic, ten in ten! Every actor is perfect, the script is an astonishing succession of suspense scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. I wonder if this movie is already on DVD, because it should be seen in the Widescreen version. I watched this movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and since then I've never forgotten it. I remember it was one of the first Warner films, a process called Warnerscope that gave a very elegant cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance would deserve an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize is not to have been directed by someone like, for example, Nicholas Ray, to increase his pace and tension.
