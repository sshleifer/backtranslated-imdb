This is a very fun, lively and light romantic comedy. You can not go wrong with the cute beauty of Meg Ryan combined with the genius of Albert Einstein. Usually, I'm not a fan of fictional tales completely fabricated about real people, now deceased and unable to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein might have gotten a laugh out of this one. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey, in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful young mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is ready to marry an idiot, a behavioral researcher named James, simply because he has the brain she is looking for in the father of her future. children. However, it is love at first glance when the car breaks down and she meets an automobile mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Since she does not think Ed is clever enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, is a matchmaker, aided in her endeavors by three malicious colleagues, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed look aptly intelligent, so he invents a riddle that portrays him as a physicist ... naturally with fun results. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious, and effectively takes Einstein's character. With his three fellow teachers, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, a lot of laughter happens. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this movie only takes one step (scandalous) forward. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite its main character), but it's a wonderful, sweet and refreshing movie. One of the best of the comedy romance genre.
