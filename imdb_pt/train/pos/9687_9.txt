A talking parrot is not an extremely imaginative idea for a new movie, but Paulie transforms a simple idea into a brilliant and moving film that will delight the whole family. It bridges the gap between sentimental junk and cruel hardness during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events of the film lead to an extremely satisfying emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone will be affected when Paulie flaps his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have received much more success, although this film was not a highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half will surely be enjoyable and memorable. Paulie's story is exciting, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment he's seen until he joins his original owner, you'll love to follow him and see him learning about friendship and dark realities of life path. It is not to be missed if you have some kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
