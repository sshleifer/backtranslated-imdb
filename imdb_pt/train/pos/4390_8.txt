In the process of trying to establish public empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), the filmmakers defame the North and the Jayhawkers. Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invading force. Southerners fought for the rights of the state: the right to own slaves, to elect corrupt legislatures and judges, and to employ a political system of spoils. There is nothing noble about it. The Missourians could easily have traveled east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that history has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, it is not because he saw the error in his way, he certainly does not surrender to the virtue of the cause of abolition.
