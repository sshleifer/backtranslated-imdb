"Father of the Pride" was another of those good shows that unfortunately do not have a very long life. And this is very sad, especially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on the air (think of "The Simple Life") I admit that there are many similarities to this show and "The Simpsons", but despite the similarities , the show has its own merits. The animation is just adequate, not amazing, but it's good. The best are the characters. All the animals are very friendly and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy have had their moments. The music was good, I liked a lot of the songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the show is not very original, I think this has a lot of potential. As "Mission Hill", a show that is not very famous but I liked it a lot, this did not have the appreciation it deserved. What a pity .
