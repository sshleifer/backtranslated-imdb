Jane Austen would definitely approve this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job capturing Emma's attitude. She's funny without being overly silly, but elegant. She puts on a very convincing British accent (not British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she deceived me ... she was also excellent at "Sliding Doors" ... sometimes I forget she's American ~ !). <br /> <br /> Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (sister and mother of Emma Thompson) as the Bates women. They almost steal the show ... and Miss. Law does not even have lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
