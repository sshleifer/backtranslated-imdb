I enjoyed watching this movie on TCM and watching a young William Powell (Philo Vance) playing the detective as he did Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell played in the Philo Vance series and in this photo, veteran actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case in which a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was screwed inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede / Secretary of Archer) gave a great supporting role and was the brother of Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Eugene Palette, (detective sergeant Heath) appeared in some of these Philo Films Vance and also gave a great performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely actor could very well be the killer. Enjoy a great classic of the past.
