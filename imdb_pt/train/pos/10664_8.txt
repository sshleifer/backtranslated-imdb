Does anyone else cry tears of joy when watching this movie? I love it! One of my top 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel good. I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the movie's baby, IMHO! I've never seen the play, but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The film production process will rarely provide a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it is only due to the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen are no more altered than they are. This is a very good movie, it's very rewarding. That's all you need to know!
