In 1955, five years after it was released, James Stewart and Anthony Mann completed six more films together, four of them West. Their relationship was obvious from the start and what was meant to be little more than a Universal show became both a cult and a classic. Fans of the period will love the fact that the top ten credit names were all better known - and this is not counting on Ray Teal or "Anthony" Curtis, who will later become Tony. Perhaps ten years later the "psychological" western was well entrenched, but in 1950 it was rare to play Ahab in the mix with Cain and Abel, not to mention several other issues along the way, and still provide a conventional western on the surface. and total credit to all interested parties. One to add to the DVD collection.
