This movie works because it looks so genuine. The story is simple and realistic, perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of teenage love and sexuality that most of us experienced during our teen years. <br /> <br /> Actors are as natural as figures in a documentary, but are as convincing and charismatic as experienced artists. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully it is not filled to the brim with cute pop culture references. In addition, cinematography is both courageous and beautiful, bringing the Lower East Side setting to life in a very tangible way. <br /> <br /> On an artistic level, I love this movie because it reminds me of a great neo Italian. reality films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Movies rarely feel as "real" as this ... or as the Bicycle Thief did. And the only other film I've seen that addresses adolescent sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Splendor in the Grass by Elia Kazan. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves tremendous praise. This movie is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I'm always happy to see a movie that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate the way my own people go on the big screen (like racist, feminine, and criminal geniuses in annoyingly popular epics), and my irritation with this account makes me extremely sensitive to other groups and their horrible silver. representations. Hispanics and Asians, in particular, seem cursed to interpret villains in western and action movies. (Thankfully, Gong Li did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks in no small part to the rise of indie photos, and the influence of Miramax, we are seeing some more photos about ethnic characters here and there ... but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. While I really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it's a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is played straight (with less exaggerated characters and broad strokes) while still very funny by itself. Finally! Latino characters worth noting. I have the feeling that this is a movie that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that he has made this wonderful film about a Dominican family, I hope Peter Sollett goes around. movie about Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
