this film is practically impossible to describe. the alternate title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese films, the story is not as linear as the American. The story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a deserter from ww2. The set is haunted (?) For an actress who died (?) During the filming of a TV show in the 60's. The director is the only one who saw this show. if you have seen Ringu (the director Hideo Nakata is the same) and liked it, you will like ghost actress. I loved the ghost actress much more than the ringu. a truly scary and disturbing film. a 10!
