Recently screened on cable, the movie opens with a warning distancing itself from any cooperation of real life people; this in itself is an eye catcher. However, the script and acting of the main characters is superb and I found myself absorbed throughout. During much of the dialogue, thoughtful and interesting. The film is about a meeting in a day between two "legends" of life real that previously composed together, then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that utters an explanation for their initial "split." What is so impressive is that the actors give seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play, flaws and all, that at least this viewer believed that I was witnessing a true event in almost every detail. The great skill of this game is that with a clever writing and good acting of a movie, basically talking about "two of us" can make a great picture. Worth at least 8 out of 10.
