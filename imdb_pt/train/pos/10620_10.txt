At first glance, I thought this story was less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many more, I think it is one of the best. Some of the songs are very bad, especially the love song, but two things stand out that make the movie, even the song, worth it. One is the art direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated vintage piece; every piece of cloth and jewelry (both of which have important parts in the plot of this film) look fresh and new, and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song, I find myself studying the princess's dress and hair, beautifully done. The other thing is the comic timing. Much of the film is extravagant, but the emperor's vanity (and his mocking of himself at the end), the suspicious guard, the guard chasing after Nicholas and the stupid prince, were all quite funny and seemed to be ridiculous on purpose. And the sequence during the song Weave-O compensates for the songs that were not so good.
