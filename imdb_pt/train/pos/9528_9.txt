Frankly, this movie went over most of its detractors. <br /> <br /> The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of the few dealing with those two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointments that accompany the parent-child relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these themes are currently fashionable. <br /> <br /> The premise is that parents in the movement, the murderer Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their children and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor discovers that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides that he wants revenge at any price, even at a very high price of perdition. Rooney, who in one scene curses the day Connor was born, refuses to hand his son Connor over to Sullivan, and hires a hired killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. Then Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son, Michael, Sullivan chases Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition, and Maguire chases Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a basement of the Church, and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only killers in this room, and there is only one guarantee, none of us will see Heaven." When the film ends, somewhat predictably, a character is saved and a character repents. <br /> <br /> I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks, but he leaves the character to play Sullivan convincingly, giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a tough edge on his face and manners, his eyes haunted by Connor's crimes. Jude Law plays Maguire in a frighteningly scary way. Tyler Hoechlin plays the young Michael naturally and without affectation. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has constantly erased the darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera draws from a palette of greens and ashes. The ashes belonged to the parents and urban landscapes of the Depression era, Illinois. The greens belonged to the younger children and to the rural plains of that state. The exuberant, sonorous and haunting music of Thomas Newman had weak Irish tones and unfolded in arrangements similar to those of Copland. The sets were authentic midwestern urban centers, churches. The houses shone with bright wood. <br /> <br /> The film's excellence lies in its generation of a unique feeling from its deep themes, distinctive acting and music and engaging cinematography. The only downside was a slight anti-gun message played in the script, the only nod to the film's politically correct. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 out of 10; with time, will be recognized as a great film.
