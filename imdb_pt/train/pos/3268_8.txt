A lovely romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I tried to summarize it three times and I can not. Suffice it to say that it is worth seeing. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so cool and everything looks so good - it creates a romantic feel throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in their best shape and enjoying every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK, but that's okay. If you are a sucker for good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), get this one. Also Downey looks great in his underwear! Extra Bonus - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All," sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
