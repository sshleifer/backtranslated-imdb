"The painting is seeing, then remembering better than you have seen." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter of The Light That Failed. The film is in the grand style of Hollywood, starring Ronald Colman and a supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in his first major role, the dependable actor Dudley Digges. (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.), and a solid performance of the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequences of the film pretty much reveal the fact that Dick loses his vision. He is blinded by the discharge of gunpowder while he and his childhood girlfriend Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a pistol. Later, a wound while fighting in Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambition, and does not really reach all his potential to the point that his vision is leaving him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and her self-destruction is set in motion. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays very well with Colman. Your evil pie reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. Well represented and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
