This was a well written tale of the Making of the Batman Sitcom and really brings our heroes together on a great mission as well as offers their TV show history. Unlike the Brady and Partridge family documentary films, we not only take a look at the past and present lives of Adam and Burt, but we can also see them back in action. Filled with Kapow and catwomen and Riddler (s), Batman is back in a well-told tale that not only gives us a satisfying closure for the Batman series, but fills the modern fan in all the Hollywood tales that about them haven 'has been heard in 35 years. Kudos !!!
