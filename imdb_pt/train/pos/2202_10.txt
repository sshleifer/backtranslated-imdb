I should have been only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe in the gift. nights. Repeating gags were Rob opening his closet (he had to use a ruler or pointer to gauge the right spot in another closet and do some other things, finally kicking the spot with what his door would open), and taking off the pins from a shirt (at the beginning of an episode, he would open a package with a new shirt, and for the rest of the show, he would find one pin after the other he missed when he unwrapped his shirt, time was everything and the pins made lots of laughs.) I remember an aunt who ran a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. He would think and create "semipermeable membrane" or osmosis, making her say how bright he was. You had to have been there. Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was onscreen. Why they did not continue the series of their POV when Wally gave up (he was afraid that he was being labeled, but then it was too late) I'll never know. I saw somewhere that the first TV marriage (great anyway) was Tiny Tim on Carson's show. Horsecocky It was Rob and Nancy (I already had a crush on her) and I remember she made the cover of TV Guide and it was printed on all the major newspapers and magazines. A trip to the Broadcasting Museum in New York years ago was disappointing as they had very few episodes and now they may have gone now. I still remember how wonderful and wish I had been a little older.
