That takes about a year after the events in "Wild Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a footballer while traveling in a car at 110 miles per hour (do not ask) she gets off the road and ends up on the Thames. She survives - he does not. Police hire psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she is mentally competent to be tried. Of course she starts playing with his mind and many murders and sex follow. <br /> <br /> This movie was condemned before it even opened. It took an eternity to get a cast and director, the script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained about the film often). Still not so bad. It's a lot like the first one - there's a lush music trail, beautiful locations, lots of sex and nudity (this had to be edited by an R), a very complicated plot and good acting - but there's no impact. It looks like a retread from the first. People are being killed here with a choker collar (I believe) ... just as people were being killed by an ice pick at the first. In a cute moment, Stone picks up an ice pick and looks at her longingly. She is also playing mental games with a man and may have involved him in murders. The similarities are very apparent. <br /> <br /> This is also VERY highly valued - there is plenty of explicit sexual talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better bare than Michael Douglas), feminine nudity (Stone still looks great and some bloody murders. but it's okay, Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. So - that's not all bad, but it seems like a remake of the first.I still recommend it.People only attacked this because Stone is not very dear and they thought it was stupid to do a continuation of "Basic ..." 14 years after it was done.
