Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once throughout the movie did I find myself looking into space. Konkana Sen did a good job on the film, although I think someone with more glamor or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did a great job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this film: THE HISTORY is great, and very realistic, it is not very direct when sending your message. I think that more film like this should be done, I'm sick of watching the same cotton candy films again and again, they're getting harder to digest now. Everyone should watch page 3, it's a great movie. -Just my 2 cents :)
