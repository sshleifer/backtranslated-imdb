"The Color Purple," is truly amazing. There is no such thing, and I do not think there will ever be. It is a roll of emotion and pain that the viewer assumes. The actors are impeccable and the direction is superb. I just loved it. A movie has never made me so happy. It's beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
