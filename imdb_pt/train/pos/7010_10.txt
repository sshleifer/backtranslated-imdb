Before I see this movie, I see a lot of comments, that everyone has a great view of the movie good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to point out is the acting in Woody Harrelson can not being in many parts of the movie, but when he appears or even in the introduction, I was impressed by the "message" of Will Smith and Woody Harrelson that they tried to create and maybe slide the whole plot to the end to really understand what it is happening. <br /> <br /> I'm not a very sentimental person, I believe a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. But an act to show redemption, there are not many films that in my point of view can show this. This is one of them that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with a person who commented on this movie showing acts of "suicide" is a downfall, however I do not believe it is the "message" the film is trying to send, but "sacrifice." A bit to the extreme, but that's the message in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie has potential. The acting is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. of a person who does not really like to watch drama movies ... if you like drama, this is a must go watch.
