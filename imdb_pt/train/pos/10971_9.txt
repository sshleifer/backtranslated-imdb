Gray Gardens is shocking, fun, sad and mesmerizing. I watched with astonishment when Ediths Jr. and Sr. quarreled and introduced themselves as they recalled their past. Their existence in a dilapidated mansion (which they have not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie that you will not soon forget.
