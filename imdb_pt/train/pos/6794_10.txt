I read most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters have major problems in life. This show, unlike most game shows, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose brilliance in everything he does, was once again the hit of the show. It is genuinely bubbling personality shines like a lighthouse wherever it goes. He's fun and makes you smile and that's exactly what the show does too. The dancers and the questions, the fashion they present only increase the appeal of the shows. And even though there's a lot of money at stake, it's fun. The stress that exists in most games does not exist here. Several people who posted messages complained how much time is spent on dancers and choose questions, etc., as Millionaire does not have similar time wasters. All I can say is that most of you have lost the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and have fun. There is something for everyone. Qustions to test your knowledge, eye candy (the dancers), suspense, the wonderful fun personality of Mr. Shatner ... well, if that does not encourage the guys, then I feel bad for you; and if that is not enough, YOU CAN BE RICH! I really miss the show. Of all the games shows that already was, and to be frank, I hate game shows, this is what I really liked and really miss. The only other program I liked was the Match Game.
