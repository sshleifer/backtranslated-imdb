The first and only one was a great movie. I had just seen it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought that was a good picture of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this movie was made four years before I was born, but I do not think the rigors of professional travel have changed much. Sad, funny and all GREAT !!! **** 10+
