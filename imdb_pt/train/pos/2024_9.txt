I loved this miniseries. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hidden, along with her son, from a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves novels ... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to escape for a few hours to England in the 1800's. I should also mention that Toby Stephens, who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.
