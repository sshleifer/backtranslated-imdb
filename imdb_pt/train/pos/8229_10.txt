This is a rather slow paced movie, slowly building the story of a former stripper who starts a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that there is something wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie even though it has a slight bitter taste in the end. He is intelligent, well rhythmic and very well represented. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmanuelle Seigner are deeply involved in their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very touching. <br /> <br /> A thriller that does not look like one. A very unconventional film with a very particular atmosphere throughout the film, although you may feel strange sometimes with some scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 8/10 !!
