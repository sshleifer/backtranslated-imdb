Yes, these films are moles. Can not recommend more. Gay or Straight is a great dock for movie buffs. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Great access. A film made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the performances are simply incredible. If you only find this movie on VHS, it's still worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I could see part of this years doco about ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching. The interviews are very revealing about the egos of the artists who are like heavy boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer, so that conquers. Nice. Follow him.
