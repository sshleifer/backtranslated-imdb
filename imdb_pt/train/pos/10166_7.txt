I watched this on an 8 hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and altitude) I actually found it a bit amusing (emphasis on "soft"). <br /> <br /> The real idea behind the movie was brilliant: a woman dies, her fiance falls in love with someone else, she decides to make sure they do not get together, but eventually she lets them do it. Unfortunately, the movie was not so good. Okay, there was some laughter and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning the plot was as predictable as the fate of the flight I was on. I think the whole gay, but not gay, part of the story could have worked out much better. The talking parrot was a good idea, but to be honest: it was not really very funny. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie was more interesting than looking at the seat in front of me, but was calling.
