The Wood Horse was one of the first "great" escape stories of World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others on their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie, but I had to by on Amazon's VHS in England and download it from the PAL format in the USA. I read the book when I was in high school, having seen part of the movie in the early 1960s on TV. The insulting drama of Peter and John trying to flee Germany during the war is more realistic than the trail of the trails portrayed in the Great Escape. This movie is a lost treasure that should be made available to the American public.
