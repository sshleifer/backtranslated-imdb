The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says, "The piston is firing short?" (implying little sexual energy from his fiancee) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she's as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very kind and very intelligent too. Her innocent and indignant expressions want her to be yours. The hero deals well with the garage mechanic for physical transformation. Did Einstein have a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle in front of the press and the public was well done. It is greatly underestimated and deserves praise and attempts at a revival. He loses a vote for including the unlikely and highly unlikely theory being bought by the US government. I do not see why it does not figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great movie, it has the presidential seal of approval on it!
