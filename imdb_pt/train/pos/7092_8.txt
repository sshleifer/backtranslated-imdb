There is a (possibly apocryphal) tale about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (supposedly) produced a long list (think of the Fifth Element aircraft) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was titled "Things Bruce Willis does when he acts". It ended with a simple message saying "please do not do any of this in my movie". <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam did not have a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I would say that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is the Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are all we expect, rightly, from a Gilliam movie. It is also full of Gilani surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam has fun with the wrong crowd. Although the end of the Twelve Monkeys does not surprise anyone who has passed through the first real, Gilliam relies heavily on Kafka in the movement of clocks, in the implacable and bureaucratic movement of the characters towards their destination. It is this journey, and the character developments that they suffer, that disturb. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam's films (Brazil in particular). But they all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is the Gilliam tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight planning department. Style, substance, and form seem to merge in a way not normally seen from the ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumor above, Gilliam can also get first-class (and very atypical) performance. outside the bald. Bruce is excellent in this film, as is the whole cast, particularly a very wacky Brad Pitt - and very scary. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since the movie was released. When I watched again, I realized I had not really aged. I had changed, of course. And that made me look at the movie with new eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, at least in part, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives, and the absurd one-way journey we all do. A first rate movie. 8/10
