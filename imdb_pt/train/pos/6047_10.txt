The brilliant thing about Withnail & I is that he captures that not long ago he left college and life could go on at any time along with all his other embellishments. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and went straight to work between the ages of 15 and 16. I know some of the broad leaves stuck the knife in this movie when it came out in theaters, but I saw it in a crowded house in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really have fun. I grew up in Dean's forest and it took me back to my growing days and narcotics (I had some great companions - I hate to think about what they are doing so far - probably running the local council). I've watched it a couple of times on DVD and I already see the film as an old companion that will stay forever as part of my collection (as I may like this movie and the Dambusters - does not look right in any way) I certainly For the second half of this film, I think the scenes of social interaction with the locals are brilliantly done. I like the mix of the three main characters and there are actually some beautiful writings here along with some very quoted lines and I dare say a good degree of integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (shame, as it's a corker). Someone told me it was originally a play, I was not sure how that worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearean touches / references that seem to appear throughout the film (also sighted the Dylan Thomas ref too) and like all the little gems, there will always be little things to discover as the final scene giving a nod to Easyrider as they begin to next day. All in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of filmmaking (love it!)
