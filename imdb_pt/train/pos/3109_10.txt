The third and final film in this trilogy is finally crystalline. It's a political movie more than a simple entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and will discover and remember the tortures he was subjected to to kill his old identity: he actually killed someone who became his corpse. But the film is finally revealing that all of this has been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aimed at eliminating all American citizens who have tried to prevent the control of the whole society by a limited group of people. Who was an essential CIA officer until 1980, when he became vice president? This goes along with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come from Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision about the CIA is a woman and that woman involves the Senate in a general. investigation. A woman and the Senate; Read my lips. In the US, politics is caught in the media and two media are essential to any presidential campaign: it's music and movies. Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the movies in general, and this particular movie, to build the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and the Senate. So go and watch the movie. It is so much fun and has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and the great change that some are waiting for and others waiting for, but no one is able to pretend that it will not come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
