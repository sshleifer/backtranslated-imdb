Updated version of a story that had been made into the 1938 film in England (Return of the Frog) about the police pursuit of a master criminal known as the Frog because of the frog how to stand up (bulging eyes etc.) that he uses . <br /> <br /> One of Wallace's good movies of the 1960s is a small, solid entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or by this influence) the resumption of Dr. Mabuse's films, Sapo seems to be more of a super villain than a major thief. Although not the best of Wallace's films, it's worth a look. It would make an interesting double feature with the excellent previous film. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
