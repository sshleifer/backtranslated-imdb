This was the beginning of everything! Granted, this is not Friends at their best, but this was the pilot of the show, let's not forget and not a bad one at that. We are introduced to the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we have a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that will come in the next ten years when Ross says, 'I just want to get married again' and Rachel comes up with a wedding dress ... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a Monica-Joey relationship, but it fits just fine now, looking back. Another thing ... in this episode, Rachel is presented to Chandler as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, so-called "flashbacks" this is contradicted, since the two met on three previous occasions. However, the point is this a good start to a great show. This episode may not be the usual, since we are accustomed to them, with the cast still a bit inexperienced, but in the next episodes we see why the show has become what it was! Keep watching, season one is a blast !!
