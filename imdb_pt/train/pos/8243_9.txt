In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of undead (caused by a mysterious "space dust") was contained through the use of special electronic collars, a lonely young man, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly) its newly acquired domesticated zombie family. Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose true father is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or his warm wife, played by Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically tagged when (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!). <br /> <br /> Timmy runs into a nuisance point, however, when his pubic friend's collar starts flashing and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbor. With the authorities in the wake of Fido, trouble with a pair of local bullies and his mother forming a bond with his domestic help, will Timmy be able to hold his new friend? <br /> <br /> A refreshing sight throughout the zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously somber comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly distorted sense of humor. Taking Romero's zombie verse and transplanting it to the small town of the 1950s, America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to address the whole "reanimated from the dead" theme I saw. Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of being included in the Hall of Fame of the Undead, along with Bub of the Day of the Dead and Tarman of The Return of The Living Dead; I often do not feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin is so good that I really got caught up in the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also gives laudable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (like Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mention ?? Ray, because for such a young man, he puts on a particularly safe curve, and Moss, because she is so yummy! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I watched this week (the others being the disappointing Planet Terror and the fun Flight of the Living Dead) and to my surprise it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly unique to the treasure and is a talent to be seen in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.
