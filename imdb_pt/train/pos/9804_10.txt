"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is as much fun as the animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> While still true to comic book sentiment, the animation is made with a lighter spirit than in animated films. Series. Bruce Wayne looks a lot like him before, but now he seems a little less imposing. The Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by the less daring and younger Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, invokes Batman's voice better than most of the live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice acting job than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in the live action films of Batman, the film lives or dies based on the quality of the villains. My all time favorite, Penguin, is here. His design is more elegant than it looked before, paying more attention to Burgess Meredith's 1960s portrait than Danny DeVito's "Batman Returns" portrait. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice. The penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate, just as it appears most commonly in comics. The voice of Hector Elizondo creates a Bane that is much more memorable than the forgettable version of "Batman & Robin". And finally, Batman has a mystery of offspring to solve by putting the "detective" back in "Detective Comics" (after all, that's what "DC" means.) The revolution for mystery is a delectable turnaround. <Br/> <br /> Punctuation enhances the movie's mysterious environment. It seems a mixture between the score of "Poirot" and the score of "Mission Impossible". All in all, it's more fun than your average cartoon.
