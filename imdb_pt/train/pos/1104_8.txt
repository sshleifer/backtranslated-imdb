The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story about how his best friend - making that client - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are packed in a small apartment in New York with not enough room in the closet and very few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy) wants to renovate the apartment, the advertising executive Jim falls in love with (or falls in love with!) An ad for a home. Once he bought the house, bills and frustration accumulate unceasingly, since anything that can go wrong with Jim's "dream house" construction goes awry. <br /> <br /> One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy - not too tiring, not a great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The chuckles are there from the beginning, when the alarm clock rings and Jim tries to turn it off, only to be frustrated at every turn of Muriel. The timing and delivery of comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of experienced pros, and that's exactly what Grant and Loy give us: perfect performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy is in a very ungrateful role (it is clear that Jim's character Jim receives most of the speeches and performances, and Grant, as always, pulls both with remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel a color, life and bite. that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas also has fun to perfection, never reaching a single wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes definitely has to be when Bill has locked himself in the 'deposit', and Jim leaves. to "save him" ... just to get everyone trapped inside! Every little problem that comes up for the Blandings renovation project - including little jealousy and an advertising campaign for 'Wham' - seems to bring together all that * could * go wrong with building a new home, but makes it believable and enjoyable . 8/10
