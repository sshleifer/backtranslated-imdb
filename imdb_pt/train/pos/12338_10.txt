Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian-era film. She plays convincingly the married woman who has a lover on the side and also focuses on a rich man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is very good as Miles. Miss Fontaine acted to perfection-she was at once clever, calculating, innocent, frightened, and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to achieve this. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely beautiful in Travis Banton's elegant dress. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
