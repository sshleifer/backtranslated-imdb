I really loved this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was amazing as Emma and strong mark was very good as chivalrous. the only complaint I had was Mr. Woodhouse..I can not believe a man could whine so much or be so selfish about his daughter's life..he was a smart girl at the end though. as always, I love the places where these Jane Austin movies were filmed. the settings are so spectacular. it makes me want to visit both England and Ireland and Scotland. I think the actors chosen for this movie were also a good choice and all the other lines of the story intertwined with Emma's were excellent! I'm glad I got to see this one too.
