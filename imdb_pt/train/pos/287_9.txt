We love the movie. I am the mother of two little men. I love having a movie that I can watch with them, where men have integrity and character. Furniture where money is not the most important. And the family is forever and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of the Davis family. But, most of all, I loved it and left me with the same feeling that others did "please do not end it". We both wish the actors did not change. The new actors were a good substitute. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son also loved this movie. asked me to go and buy them all. He's a movie critic, so he says that tells me something. Family should all see this move buy it for friends. Help bring back a time of values. We'll be reading the books now that we're addicted. I really hope to see more. Be blessed happy on the move
