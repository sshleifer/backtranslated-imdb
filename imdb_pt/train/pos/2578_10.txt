Superman and the Mole Men are possibly the most difficult adventures of Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home of the world's deepest oil well. While there, some radioactive mole men climb the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other people in town try to get rid of the mole men invaders. Can Superman change people's moods in time to save the moles? Can Superman warn people in time about the radioactive danger that moles men bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and the Mole Men is a very clever, well-written and well-played movie. Even if we can only see Superman fly once briefly, he still does a great adventure in Superman. A must see for anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
