Not so many people like Bertrand's films simply because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different types of people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived under deep despair intertwined with great personal hope, it may be difficult for you to enjoy the humor shown here. <br /> <br /> And also blier film can not be easily classified as black comedy or cult comedy, etc., like those of pulp fiction etc. Because there is such delicacy that the audience in North America often does not appreciate. <br /> <br /> When I looked at these two 'hooligans' having dinner with Jeanne Moreau at the seaside restaurant, I felt they were kinder than any gentleman could have been. <br /> <br /> The desire to make love uncontrollably is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of being meaningless being symbolized by the truck suddenly emerges in Carrefour. <br /> <br /> So, les valseuses is a much better name than going places. To dance a waltz you need to be classy, ​​but go to places you do not.
