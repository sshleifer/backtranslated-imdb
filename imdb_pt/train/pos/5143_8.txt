With the rapid intercalation of scenes of insane people into an asylum, and mounting / superimposing vague and intertwined images and narratives, this is a very difficult film to follow. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) accepts a job as a janitor or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his wife in prison, and perhaps to rescue her. But she is clearly mad, hunched over on the floor, with an empty expression most of the time and fear, misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. The filmmaker changes to his point of view a few times, and we see vague images of her next to a lake drowning a baby or catching a drowned child. She is tormented by something. When the point of view changes for her or for other crazy people, the filmmaker uses distorted lenses and these things, showing us what crazy people see and how they react. And the place is filled with crazy people, laughing, hiding and, in one case, dancing frantically night and day. At one point the man tries to take his wife out, but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell. Gradually the man falls into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in another attempt to steal her, and he kills the doctor and many attendants, and all the time the madmen laugh and clap. When he wakes up, he is relieved and cleans the floor. Some fascinating shots of Japanese life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.
