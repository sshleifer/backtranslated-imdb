I got to the end of it and almost shouted, "No, no, no, NO! You can not stop here!" There are many unanswered questions! So I read that at least two of the cast members had died and I have to say, I know it probably would not be true for Lars' vision von Trier but I would be happy to see the acting actors just to see the end he had planned! Granted, it would be hard to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves. I see a more egocentric, disinterested and hypocritical character on the screen! But, I could ignore a change in the actors .... I just have to know how it ends!
