And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it fit for television was very ill advised. ALL ABOUT DRUGS IS CUT AND COVERED !!! How do they do this, you may ask? Well, they do not do it very well, for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana Cheech and Chong should have in their possession, they say they have diamonds! Still, the characters walk in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along the way without any explanation!
