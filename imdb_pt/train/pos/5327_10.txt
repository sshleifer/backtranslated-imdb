As an experienced fan I recommend this movie as true to the facts and well acted. At the age of 11, living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new musical sensation that made the girls scream. I thought hmmmm, if the girls like it, they must be crap. My only records so far were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly afterwards, while on vacation with my family at a military diner in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned to be 'Love Me Do') and was impressed by the difference between her and all the songs I had heard so far. When I heard the older brother's 'Meet The Beatles' album, I was hooked for a lifetime. Having read the definitive book of its beginnings (by Davis) I was surprised that this film followed the facts very well except for leaving out most of the sex and some of the drugs I used (it touched on the use of methadrine / dexadrine). >
