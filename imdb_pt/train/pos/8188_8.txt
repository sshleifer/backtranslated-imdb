I liked the first part of this duo, The Impossible Planet, and I was a bit worried that the second part did not hold up as well as it has been true in the past two groups of the past. But, fortunately, my fears were unfounded when I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. Either way, we started with the surviving flight crew of the Ood, who became the Devil's pawn. There is also a bit of philosophizing on the part of the Doctor in the episode that I quite liked. Needless to say, it was a good and solid story of Doctor Who. It may be a little too intense for younger viewers. <br /> <br /> My notes: B +
