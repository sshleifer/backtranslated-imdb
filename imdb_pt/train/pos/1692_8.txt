Like the great classic drawings of Bugs Bunny, this movie has humor on different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. They both liked the movie - bursting into laughter a few times ... and my daughter is not much of a science fiction fan. The movie kept me laughing, although I've seen it a few times ... adult-level humor (that is, the humor that adults will simply have because of larger life experiences, nothing baudy or pornographic that can be found here) maintains the movie also enjoyable for adults. For example, from adult-level humor, Martian voices are based on characters from different films / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, Dr. Strangelove, of Peter Seller. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of the top 10 actors really favors the movie, and the actors play their part well - in fact I would say that the producers chose the actors and their abilities for role needs in relation to box office power (an excellent example is the character "Vern" of Wayne Alexander.I had to write this comment ... children are playing this for the third time in 4 days during dinner now.Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there is nothing of bored film.
