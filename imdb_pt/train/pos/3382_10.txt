Not often I had the feeling of a movie that could be visionary. But clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not tend to be alarmist and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit in with our emotions of the moment. But did not we say that about "1984"? James Orwell knew that the Internet would become reality shortly after 1984; In fact, it was 1994; he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did. Retrospective rewarded. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What matters is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our environment, but actually thrill with an "apple of love" when need knocks at our door. A picture of ourselves in old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the timeline for us, I know we have not yet seen the beginning of it. <br /> <br />
