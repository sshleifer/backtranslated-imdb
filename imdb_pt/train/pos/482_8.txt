This is a poem on film, beautifully presented and photographed with sensitive art. It captures the atmosphere of time and place perfectly. (Lake District of Italy in the 1920s). It's a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and believable. The settings are delightfully exotic. Some of the scenes - the funeral boat in the fog - the high chunks of the chess table in the center of a tile floor with intricate patterns - are beautiful images. And instead of the obligatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet. If the film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
