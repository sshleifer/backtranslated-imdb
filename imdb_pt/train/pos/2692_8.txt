I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a great direction, by the well-known Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the film takes place in Catalonia to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Luna once again explores the subject of an obsession, in this case the obsession of a young man for women. milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex the eldest son feels at the birth of his brother. In the film, this is what leads to the obsession of the young man who suddenly sees all the milk from his mother to the newborn son. Then he begins to try to find a breast that is capable of feeding him. He finds her in a woman who has recently arrived and from here in the movie is around that. <br /> <br /> This film lives on a lot of images, rather than the story itself, the viewer captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves a detailed analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The surroundings, the typical landscapes of the region as well as the surreal behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack of Nicola Piovani take us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which crosses it from time immemorial. sometimes ... It's worth living in this world, it's worth watching this movie, although we may occasionally and at times get tired and a little sick with the excessive obcession that may be carried over the limits ... < I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
