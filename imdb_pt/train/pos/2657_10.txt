"Nothing, there's nothing in room 237. But you have nothing to do with it anyway, so stay out. <br /> <br /> There has never been such a feat of psychological horror as this movie achieves. This is the best rated horror film of all and with good reason. Jack Nicholson is an excellent actor and this is one of the greatest performances in the cinema. <br /> <br /> It is about a family that moves to a secluded and deserted hotel for 5 months during the winter. Then the father (Jack) is almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's direction is not short, so perfect. The tense accompaniment of shots, agonizing music, mystical messages and baffling plot make this the best horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film there are constant references to danger, death and horror. Red is used in ALL scenes. Is red intentionally placed by Kubrick? Of course! <br /> <br /> This is a definite classic of Kubrick and this is the third of his films that I gave 10/10. He is a perfectionist in your direction and you can see this in all his films. He loves to perplex his viewers in all his films. <br /> <br /> I'll talk about this movie in the coming months. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the basis of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
