Oh, where you go, my little one, little one ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you'll have four ... <br /> <br /> I remember those shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanations of rocket science. I watched as history, science and humor were all entwined in a captivating story of possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who at first would not even enter the room, but then changed her mind when she saw they were partially excited. As she watched, I watched her, and in the end she was almost as absorbed as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're a young wife with your own babies ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself thinking that my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class, not only as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as fun and easy to understand the lessons of history. <br /> <br /> Turn around, turn around, come back and again ... you're wondering how much really has changed in 50 years.
