Excellent film, a realistic picture of contemporary, touching and profound Finland. One of the best Finnish films of all time. Captures wonderfully everyday life in a small town in Central Finland, the desires and weaknesses of people, joys and sorrows. The bright sun of early autumn creates a cool atmosphere for this lucid examination of people in a wellness society. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. It shows that it is possible to make exciting films without machine guns and bloodshed. Her next film, Eila, is also worth seeing, although the story of cleaning up women struggling for their jobs is not as universally appealing as the destinations at Joki.
