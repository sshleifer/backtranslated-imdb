When I saw this as a child, he answered all my questions and dispelled all the fears or misunderstandings I had. It's easy to watch, because it's lively, which makes it non-threatening. It has no moral preconceptions or "preacher" aspects, so no one should object to this. It's a nice movie that simply provides the facts of menstruation in a reassuring and "natural" way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
