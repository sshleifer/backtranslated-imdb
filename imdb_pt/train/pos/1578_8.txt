Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. The Reichdeutch women think their Jewish husbands were locked until deportation. An aristocrat renegade by his family, Lena Fischer, is among the mob, as well as General Gudarian's sister. But hierarchy and privilege deserve no special consideration. <br /> <br /> Nor will the service to the Reich as a female detainee whose husband is on Ostfront will learn. In one of the most horrifying scenes of the film, the guards take the wedding ring given by the soldier husband. <br /> <br /> So that you do not think that this is typically German brutality, we in America have Lady Bush ordering the arrest of the Golden Star Mothers (mothers of dead soldiers in action) because their presence is offensive. Little, regrettably, changed in the 60's from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately eight-year-old daughter Ruth escapes capture. Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is at first reluctant to accept that Ruth responds in a way we take as typically German. Even Lena Fisher's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who knows and opposes the Holocost, warns Lena against it. but Lena chooses to embrace the idea with an American rebellion that even renames Ruth, the more Aryan name of Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse, but Lena cries: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, goes out in search of her mother's past and meets Lena, 90, under the guise of writing a personal war story. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look for the family, but I never verified the fate of his grandfather known to have served on the Ostfront.
