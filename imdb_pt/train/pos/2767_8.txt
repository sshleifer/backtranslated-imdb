Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or so there) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same can not, however, be said for the rest of the film. It's not horrible and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I were to be honest) to see this is Peck. For the rest you are best just reading the Old Testament.
