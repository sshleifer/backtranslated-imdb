I only saw this movie today with my kids (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After the film, the children of the audience were able to ask the director, Tian-Ming Wu, questions. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the making of the film. <br /> <br /> All tangents aside, my two sons really liked this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything, but the point is that this movie is MUCH better than 95% of the crap in Hollywood (especially children's movies) out there. <br /> <br /> Congratulations. <br /> <br /> There is a "real" / original King of Masks that could / could do 12 masks at one go. The film's actor trained and learned to make up to 4 masks at a time (so they cut and changed to 4 new masks).
