It's been 16 years since its original version, I would have expected some "marketing wizard" to have promoted a live actor version of this classic so far, or at least wanted to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science fiction or cartoon network did not catch that. Galaxy Rangers really had thoughtful plans and even better scripts. The animation was above average for its time, and excellent when compared to today's Japanese animation. Anticipated the heavy toy tie on the market, this may have sealed his doom as well. I would like to spend money on a GR DVD if available.
