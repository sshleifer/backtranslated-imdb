I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with a great range of comments. It seems in Cambodia (the English subtitles say the character is speaking Thai, but the movie says Cambodia) a very violent evil man is raising boys to be murderers using hunger and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings a police partner is killed. Police officer Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father, who is also a police officer who has been shot and is in a coma. Wai's boss is friends with his father and is worried about Wai's erratic behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who caught his father in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father will not let her out (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it but saves her from the father who seems to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III). Wai becomes increasingly obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to her home where they are married and she gets pregnant Wai follows and joins the evil man (who is training the boys) making a deal to fight and train so he can get Pang. There is a major confrontation between Wai and Pang with the woman terribly victim of the great victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting off his dead mother's son just to die and leave him as the next possible kid to be raised as a killer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many violent scenes that are very brutal. The woman with a long nail ripped out of her foot. Knives for the neck and torso. Weapons fired directly at the head. And a lot of intense beatings. Maybe it's dark intense and pessimistic, but it's definitely worth seeing.
