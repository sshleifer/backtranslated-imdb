One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music from Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> Great songs include "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All". My eggs in a basket. "The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings" Let Yourself Go "with Grable among the supporting singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that stays with you for days. It also sings "But where are you?" Captivating and fast, this entry into the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best.The classic and surprising ending, "Let's Face Music and Dance" is among the best known of their numbers.Robers uses one of the great dresses in the history of cinema ... a sparkling number of sequins that revolves around Randolph Scott seems like a weird choice as to whether or not he is a man, but he is not a man. Ast's friend air, but he also appeared in his Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have larger parts in 1936, but they have some scenes and have little impact. Allwyn has the biggest role, but it's just OK. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the series with "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and beating, it's great music. <BR> Fun all the way, although I got tired of "We joined the Navy" after the third time ....
