I do not remember too many details about the show, but I remember how passionate I was and how determined I was not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately back then we did not have a VCR so I never saw the show again. However, I can strongly remind how I felt while watching and how I was thrilled every time he came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor today (I think I was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors of the day, mainly due to his appearance in the series. I would be happy to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long ago ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a site dedicated to the series or do you have the tape episodes of your first showing?
