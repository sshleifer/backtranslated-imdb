An unexpected pleasure as I had not heard anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> Shameful as long as it justifies having a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully human story with a social message kindly told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. He acted solidly for the directors. Beautifully photographed with soft colors floating against the gray that captures the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent foray into the Chinese film (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) has been thrilling. to continue exploring. China and its people are an incredible screen for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in recent Chinese films. <br /> <br />
