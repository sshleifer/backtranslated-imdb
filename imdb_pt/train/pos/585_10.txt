Seeing this movie, once again, it seemed infinitely superior to me than in the past. The acting is incredibly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the wandering son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally well in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful piece from the days period of the 1920's speakeasies. The landscape is unbelievably beautiful from the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the best films made in the 1990s. You should see this movie! <br /> <br />
