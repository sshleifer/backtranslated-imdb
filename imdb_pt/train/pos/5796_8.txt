Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music movie with Michael Jackson, with different segments. I will sort each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a video clip. The music video is a concert of Michael Jackson playing the song "Man in the Mirror", the music video also shows montages of historical figures like Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the film I liked the song and also loved the assembly of the historical figures. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a five-time premiere of Michael Jackson's Jackson for his solo career. The assembly that I found well done, I liked the animation they put in and I also loved their song choices like "I want you back, Beat, Thriller, you can feel it and the way you make me feel." The only thing I wish they could have done a little better in one of the songs on the set up is "We Are The World". The reason why is all you see are raindrops and in these drops are images of Michael Jackson and the choir of celebrities, but it's a bit difficult to see the chorus. In addition, the segment is still good. I give a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is Bad music. You're probably thinking that Michael Jackson's music video is bad, well, yes and no. This segment is the clip, but it is remade by Kids. The segment was cute, but not as good as the other segments. I give a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short film from Claymation Music that takes place after the infantile version of bad called "Speed ​​Demon". The short is about Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to escape them. The claymation following the chase was great, but parts of the movie, the Claymation characters, seemed a bit fake when interacting with real people. Also at the end of Michael Jackson's rabbit costume clip comes to life and he is dancing with it. I liked the dance, but this was like out of nowhere. I give an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is the Michael Jackson Grammy-winning music video, "Leave Me Alone." The Music Video is about the media nudging the personal life of Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson feels that he will not leave him alone no matter how innocent he is. The music video really speaks (but keep in mind that this happened before child sexual abuse, just about the rumors of it in the 80's), but I did not feel that this Video should be in this movie because it's a children's movie and I do not think that the boy will understand what he is singing. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect children (including John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon) from an evil mafia named Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The segment I thought really brought the movie especially when he danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a bunch of Criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The weird thing about the Segment is why kids go out with an adult man and never explains why. Also the character Joe Pesci talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why do you talk about drugs in a children's movie? Another sage was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final segment of the entire movie. The ending of the film is with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of the Beatles song "Come Together" and then during the credit we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good cover of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to include a group of good singers with a talented musican like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie, I think it really brings the imagination of children. The film is almost as imaginative as the Beatles' animated film "Yellow Submarine," if you like Michael Jackson and you're making a movie with a lot of creativity, this is the movie. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
