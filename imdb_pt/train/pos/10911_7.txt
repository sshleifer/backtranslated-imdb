He enjoyed this 1936 film with many veteran classic actors and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts" who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane," and they divorced and yet they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything he could to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a kind of craziness and there's a lot of Comedy from 1936 and the murder method is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey at a California Autodrome. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" has given a great supporting role as a bookie along with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr. Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery. If you see this movie, remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought that this was a great entertainment and really was in those days!
