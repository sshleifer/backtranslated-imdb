It seems that this movie is polarizing us. You love or hate. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s) that said, you just have to "feel" this. <br /> <br /> In addition, at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting by Monet - an Impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small touches from so close that the painting looks like a mess, but in the distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I believe this is a tip for the viewer. This movie is like that Impressionist painting. It's an Impressionist cinema! And it is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to this painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. This requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are jumping scenes and no, you are not always going to be sure of what is happening. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You will need to focus on this movie, but I think people are making the mistake of focusing too much on it. Once it's over is when you should think about it. If you try to figure out how you are unfolding, you will overload. Just let it happen ... "go" with that ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the review for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the performances excellent and thought she was tremendously unique, wildly creative and fascinating. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those who did not like it. It appeals to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking and challenging spiritual movies, then look. If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I have described then you will surely like it.
