True movie fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who are classifying this movie as a star and calling it unrealistic. Although I do not have the background or come from the protagonists' environment, I spent many years working in low-income and working-class neighborhoods and felt that the performance was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. I do not know what is the basis for the comments of others that the film is "unrealistic". Dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> The low production value did not bother me at all. I felt that natural lighting improved the character of the film. The focus was entirely on the story line and the character's development, not the brilliance or melodrama of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I completely bought the character's motivations and reactions. The acting was compelling and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then skip it. If you like character-driven dramas, then look. <br /> <br /> (About negative comments being trolls: click on their names and you will see that most have no other criticisms or just negative reviews.)
