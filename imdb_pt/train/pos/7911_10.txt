As a child, I loved computer animation, although it was EXTREMELY limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This movie, when I got scared and watched the amazing images and the almost hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving things on the computer. This is a complete package deal, between music and video, that really does a one-two punch. If you know any kids who want to get involved in computer animation, this is a must have. <br /> <br /> I still, almost 20 years later, I rate this movie as one of my 3 favorites. The originality, I think, is still insurmountable by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood has spit on. At the moment, I want to see if I can redo this by myself; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then this movie deserves a ton of imitation =)
