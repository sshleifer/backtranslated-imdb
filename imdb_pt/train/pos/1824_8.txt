All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I always liked. When I was a kid, I used to watch it every day. It is underestimated if you look at your rank in IMDb and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie as many people say, it's a really good movie. This is good and your kids will probably enjoy it. Even if it's classified as G, some parents might find it a bit violent. In fact, it's a rather dark story, where dogs are similar to mobsters involved in gambling, extortion, even cold-blooded murders. The film follows a dog named Charlie who escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up returning to Earth. Many younger children watching this movie may feel like they are watching a great children's movie. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that may scare the kids, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last movie a little girl named Judith Barsi was on. Unfortunately, she was killed at an early age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and did not deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can not watch this movie because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is good but a bit different from many other children's films. This was popular at the time of its release, but was surpassed by the mega-popular Disney The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that is not designed by adults too, but if you are a child, or if you grew up with this movie as a child, then I'm sure you'll enjoy watching.
