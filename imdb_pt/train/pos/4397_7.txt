An unconventional historical drama with some beautiful battle scenes. Tobey Maguire delivers excellent performance and gets a good backup. The script is literary and very original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. That said, it creeps a bit, and the last roll is a lot like a mini-TV series. Still, Frederick Elmes' camera work keeps one interested in the boring bits (and from time to time you see a shot reminding him that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
