I went to see this Finnish movie and I have to say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year. The intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all happening on the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very well in the end, reminding, perhaps, a little of the way Tarantino's movies are made. Most of the actors performed very well, which is certainly needed in such realistic dramas. I especially liked the performance of Sanna Hietala, the lead actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB has misinformation about Sanna. His name, as you may have noticed in my comment;), is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
