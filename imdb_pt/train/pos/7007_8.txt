From the first scene you get clues about what might be happening here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story unfolds. The acting is excellent and these actors touch your soul. Even knowing what would happen, I was extremely intrigued by the reason. I'm still puzzled as to why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "second thoughts," but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and exciting story, but it confused me. Maybe that was the purpose of the movie. I liked the movie and Wil Smith can arrange another good movie choice. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
