When you read the summary of this movie, you may think this is a weird movie and in a way it is, for the main character of this movie, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbe) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle tips on what will happen to him as the story goes on and it's a lot of fun for the viewer to try to discover the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and some hints to the end of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement and does not get boring for a minute. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven. His style of direction is clearly visible and it can be said, looking from different angles, that "De Vierde Man" is a typical movie of Verhoeven. Not only will it look typical to people familiar with their American films because of nudity and violent graphic scenes, but it will also seem typical to people familiar with their Dutch films because of the same things and their talent for telling a great story. . When people watch American films from Verhoevens, people with limited vision may say that they do not have the talent to tell a good story and focus only on blood and sex. It's what some people think while I think he's a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each movie. Although not a good movie, Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example of what Verhoeven can do more than science fiction films and maybe companies should trust him more and offer more movies for him. He needs it. Just watch your Dutch films. Not only do they show that he needs some freedom, but also show that he has remarkable talent. 'De Vierde Man' brought him closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> 8 out of 10
