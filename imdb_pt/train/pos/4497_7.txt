I saw only the first part of this series when it debuted in the late 90's and only recently did I get a chance to watch all three parts via Netflix (convenient service, by the way). All in all, I enjoyed this fun mini-series, sometimes challenged by the genre. The story of a younger man falling in love with an older woman seems to work and the actors are fine. Yes, there are some romantic cliches of running in the rain or goodbye at the train station, but the characters have a chance to be exploited, so it does not look tacky, as it would be if it were a Tom Hanks vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a separate one at birth, Scott Bakula does a great job with someone who is upside down in love, and the stream of desire and rejection plays the series on an assistive meal. Personally, I think the series could have been done with two episodes, but that's under debate, I suppose. Apparently, there is a sequel, and that should arrive tomorrow via Netflix.
