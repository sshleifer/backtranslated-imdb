This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable images, good acting and touching subjects. It would be very easy to write it as being too sentimental, but that's the feeling that this kind of movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the unfolding and presentation of the story. There were some cheesy shots, but that's to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure up is that there were not a ton of details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures, etc. of Joseph Smith; was designed for a quick glimpse of some of the highlights of one of the most incredible American religious and historical figures of all time.
