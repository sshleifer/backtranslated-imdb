Okay, I know I should not like this movie, but I know. From Pat Morita's adorable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying scream, I laughed throughout this movie. While you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good mvie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morita talking to her boss in Tokyo with the second drink.
