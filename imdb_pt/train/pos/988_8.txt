I liked this movie. When the guy who was in a bank robbery of $ 40 million in gold dies, his cellmate is used as a "bait" to get them to the crazy killer partner of high tech (by having a monitoring device deployed in his jaw without your knowledge). It's an action-type spy movie with enough comic scenes to keep the light going. It reminded me of the Enemy of the State. Well represented and good enough plot.
