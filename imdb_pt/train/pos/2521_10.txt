I must admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I'm a big fan of Gackt and a big Hyde fan. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of scenes that would be, so to speak, pleasing to the eyes of women, but a rather extravagant story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded out there. And now that I've just watched - I feel the need to tell the world its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt gave heartbreaking performances, and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. You get sucked into the story and really feel the characters in the end. The element of vampirism - which I love, but is too easy to exaggerate or spoil a movie - is subtly blended into the plot to the point of making it something merely exotic, normal to this scenario, rather than an unnecessary random addition to the story . . I rated him 9 out of 10 at the beginning ... and then I came back and tried to think about why I was not giving the last point. Came with nothing. So ten in ten is. After all - I'm not very critical - the fact that I'm bothering to write a review means that I really hate the movie or really love it. You can tell which side I am with Moon Child.
