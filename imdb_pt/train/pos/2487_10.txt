I must say that, looking at Hamlet from a student's perspective, Branlet's version of Hamlet is by far the best. Your dedication to staying true to the original text should be applauded. It helps the game to make a living on the screen and makes it easier for people holding text while watching, while studying it, tracking and analyzing the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things I've heard criticized many times is the cast of Hollywood big names in the play. I think this helps viewers recognize the characters more easily, as opposed to having actors who seem and sound the same way that help in the confusion usually associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> In addition, your flashbacks help to enlighten many people. ambiguities in the text. For example, how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia actually happened and why the Fortinbras was in the castle at the end. All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances from familiar actors and unfamiliar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that you do not need to be a PhD in English Literature to understand and have fun.
