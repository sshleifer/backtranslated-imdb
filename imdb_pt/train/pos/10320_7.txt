*** Possible spoilers *** Recently I watched this movie with my 11 year old son and I was happy to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. Ron Ely is right as Doc. Cool, calm, almost always in control (and with an occasional gleam in his eyes). What more can you ask? I've never read a book from Doc Savage, so I do not know if it's true to the source, but I liked the light tone and the zeal. Many people compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair. The difference in budget is impressive (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders have. The special effects are also minimal, but they appear in people, the story is very funny and humor is ideal. Sousa 's music is captivating (I love this theme song - Every time I watch the movie, I end up humming the theme for days). The best way to approach this movie is simply to relax and enjoy. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian shooter across the rooftops of New York and the very funny fighting sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good the villain who sleeps in a giant crib (actually!). Overall, a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give him 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... I thank the Lord that he's here!
