For anyone who has seen only the prodigious version of Disney's 'Beauty & The Beast' from Disney Productions, or even Jean Cocteau's surreal vision of fairy tales will be quite astounded by this French version of 1975 (but with a director from Poland ). The plot relates to a French family of faded aristocracy who is getting married in a well to make the English family. The biggest problem is that the groom is carrying an ancient curse on the family. The film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) explaining this familiar curse. From the opening credits to the end, it's a fun erotic ride almost nonstop, with some explicit and explicit sexual content (hence the X rating of the movie in the US in its initial execution, which is now unrated). The somewhat disdainful feeling of the film in the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel's flights in similar territory. If you have a taste for the truly bizarre, and do not get offended with the "taboo" stuff, then this movie may just scratch that itch for you.
