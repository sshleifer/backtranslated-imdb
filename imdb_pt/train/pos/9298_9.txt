It's simply one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. It's a parody of crime-life, parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930.- There really is no need to underestimate this movie because the rating is less than 5. It's a mass opinion, and mass is hypnotized. Who decide to watch - will regret it, whoever decides not to watch - will regret it more.
