This is a great irresistible movie, lively and technically well done! <br /> <br /> The film features some of the best sets you've ever seen in a 1930s movie, even though it's obvious they're sets rather than real locations. Often, if a character were to fall or shake the doorframe with a great deal of aggression, the whole scenario would obviously move. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the movie were the quiet moments, more old-fashioned and funny. This shows that René Clair's true heart was in silent cinema. The overall mood is really great in this movie. It is also clear that the musical moments were more than optimal. This is a very nice light and simple nice early French musical. Although the best moments are the moments of silence, this does not mean that the film is not filled with a great humorous dialogue, which is very well transmitted by the main actors, who all seemed to stage actors for me, which in this case worked extremely well . well for the film its overall style and nice non-worries atmosphere. No wonder this worked so well, since this movie is based on Georges Berr's plays. <br /> <br /> It's a great technical film, with some great camera innovations and some great ones. editing, which creates a bit quick and enjoyable to watch nice sequences. There's never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a clever director that he knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It is a very creative film, which despite its simplicity still feels like a totally original and cleverly constructed film that never takes to entertain. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is especially unforgettable fun without spoiling. too, and is actually among the biggest as well as most creative moments at the beginning of the movie comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of very nice characters, who are all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks. All of this contributes to the film's pleasant, comedic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest movies you've ever seen! <br /> <br /> 8/10
