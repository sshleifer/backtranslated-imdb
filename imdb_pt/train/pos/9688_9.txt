I approach movies about talking animals with care. For each as wonderful as Babe, you get an equally poor like the awful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or, in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a movie that does not meet your potential. When I heard of Paulie, the premise of a mind-blowing parrot did not fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And you can infiltrate your heart without your noticing. <br /> <br /> A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research lab. One day, he hears singing from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in his cage singing his little heart out. Misha is fascinated with the bird, especially when one sees the parrot can not only sing, can talk. And not a few phrases either. It's a parrot you can actually talk to. <br /> <br /> The parrot is called Paulie (voice of Jay Mohr), and recognizes a shipwreck mate in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell his life story. It all started when he was a baby, and cared for Marie, a five-year-old girl with stuttering. The two became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!). <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents became concerned about their intimate friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did after Marie almost hurt herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to reunite with her, Paulie begins a long journey through America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying long distances and even ending behind bars. From a cage that is! Paulie was one of several talk-animal movies released by DreamWorks in the late 1990s. And although he has not had the same recognition or box-office success as Babe, Paulie is successful on some levels, and is an occasional job of impressive intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's standing style. acting is well suited for Paulie's part. He never plays the role as very convinced, even though he's a bit clever Aleck. Paulie is worldly, but he is also naive in his way. <br /> <br /> Because he lived a very protected life with Marie, when he is taken, he has to defend himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they promise Paulie to reunite him with Marie, whom he believes. Only for those promises to be broken over and over again. <br /> <br /> Paulie is admittedly a bit episodic. He follows the eclectic people with whom Paulie ends, and as he slowly draws closer to Marie. He first ends up in a pawn shop where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a gentle woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and drives a caravan across America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is occasionally a very touching movie. Your scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Paulie's wonderful moments perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogues are well written and even thought-provoking: "There are things in life that you postpone because you think you'll make them more But the real thing that Ivy taught me is that you have to live as if it could not be later. <br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy dies on the way leaving Paulie alone is too time to cut the heart And the sequence in which he finds the courage to fly for the first time through the Grand Canyon, rising majestically is such a beautifully composed scene that he stays with you for hours after the movie ends. Despite the occasional Paulie falls down with a group of parrots at a Spanish open-air restaurant.The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number.And Paulie even has one that is frustrated. he falls with a small thief (played by Mohr as well). That may be the only complaint I have. Once you're comfortable with one situation, the movie then takes Paulie to another. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is funny, but also a little disturbing. It surprises me that DreamWorks has had the chance to include this scene in a children's movie. And Paulie's diamond theft is too Mission Impossible. He is caught red-handed, and sent to the laboratory for tests on animals, where he has remained since. <br /> <br /> The story finally completes the cycle in the lab, where Misha promises to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity that I was paralyzed for several minutes. Paulie may never have the longevity that Babe has, but I believe it's an equally brilliant film. The same laughter The same effects without fail. And the same amazing intelligence. <br /> <br /> A little gem.
