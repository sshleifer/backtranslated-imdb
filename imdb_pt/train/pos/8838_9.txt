Finally, a film in which the audience is guessing until the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will crawl towards destruction, since there is nowhere else to go, but we do not know how or when close to end of the movie. Hoffman is superb as usual, and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother, who basically does what he is told, since he really can not think for himself. Hawke might have been a bit out of his element, but he played the role well enough. Join in to this mix Andy's wife, played perfectly by Marisa Tomei, cheating on Hank; Andy's misuse of funds to pay for his addictions to drugs and sex; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie will make you think.
