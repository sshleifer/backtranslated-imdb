It is a story that could have happened anywhere under the right circumstances. Street artist drawing the attention of the famous opera star and the friendship that followed. Old artist meets / buys a male child to pass his art to. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river. Traveling from city to city, he presents himself and has some degree of notoriety. Despite times and influences, man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances are top notch, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays the street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and absolutely strong, and well supports the obvious prejudices. The two protagonists, along with the support of the gentle opera singer, Master Liang (a curiously androgynous, Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the remote similarities of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (EXCUSE MY CONCUBINA); However, this film can not stand easily by itself, any similarity is remote at best. <br /> <br /> My only resentment with the KING OF THE MASKS is the end. He was weak, clich√©, and as subtle as a sledgehammer. Were the audiences already involved in the story, so manipulation was unnecessary? What a pity. Bringing a movie so far, just to surrender to the pathetic emotional (and tacky) that way. He made this frankly good movie, rather than the classic, it should have been. Also, the KING OF MASKS is still well worth it. I was happy to see that the Shaw brothers are still producing good movies. Highly recommended.
