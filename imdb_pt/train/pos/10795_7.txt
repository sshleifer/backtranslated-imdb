Overall, the film was pretty good, a good plan of action with a good amount of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing but disarm the bomb and shoot some characters. The film was very much like the events of September 11, with a bin Laden terrorist sending a video to the president (Urich) and threatening to detonate him. Judson Mills had some superb action roles, taking out Rashid's compound and several kick-butt roles, but there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with that on his computer. But overall, it was realistic and did not lack the action, but only happened with the part of Norris. I gave the movie 7/10.
