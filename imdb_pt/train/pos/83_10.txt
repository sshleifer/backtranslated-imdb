A few years ago I added a comment to IMDB on the TV series "The Real McCoys". I said then and again that it was a lovely show, fun and entertaining, well represented with wonderful characterizations. <br /> <br /> I recently saw on DVD four more episodes older than the 2000 Reunion with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned here, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not mentioned, but perhaps they can be traced via SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The meeting show was well done and gave us many unknown insights about the show. One insider we failed to do was whether or not Kathy Nolan regretted abandoning the program in a nasty contractual dispute that left Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nolan went on to make a comedy bomb called "Broadside" about female nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Take it? BROADside No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the despicable, lascivious and violent TRASH on TV that is so weakening our values, "The Real McCoys" entertained with decent values ​​and excellent human beings. And thanks to everyone involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing me to my family. We never missed it.
