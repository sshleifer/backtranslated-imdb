Xizao is a weird little movie. It is simple and undemanding and, at the same time, so rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of the old and new confrontation is beautifully presented in the early scenes. This theme is the essence of the movie, but would have fallen if it were not for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them. <br /> <br /> The elderly patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China. days of pre-expansion. He runs a bathroom in an old neighborhood. Every single scene set in the bathroom is a source of joy to us, unhappy and unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's mentally deficient son, Er Ming, is the second truly powerful character in the film, along with his modern-life brother. The interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bathroom, are incredibly detailed and heartfelt, with some scenes containing so much emotion that it is beyond almost everything seen in the movies. With his regime-critical message, this film was not only censored, but also given too small coverage. It may be a coincidence, but when a movie of that caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet (!), You can not help but be suspicious. <br /> <br /> So, help freedom of expression and film world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you own the DVD, if there is one, share the share!
