This movie was fun, but for the wrong reasons. The co-ordination of the action sequences is laughable and makes the movie have some funny cap moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where Williamson tells Ginty: "You sure are kidding!" I liked this movie just for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the plot that must have been written on the back of a four-line napkin and the rest probably improvised. A movie with more than 30 parts only has a list of credits for 10 or more. It seems strange that no one else has a credit in the movie, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. The only thing this movie has to do is that it's pretty violent, so it tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty to make a movie worthy of being seen.
