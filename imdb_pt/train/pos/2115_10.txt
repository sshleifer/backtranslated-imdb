After seeing You Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original movie that inspired this, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed by this movie. It is a real gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you did not see it, I'd like to ask you to see it today. I'm not against re-makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original but this time I have to admit that the You Got Mail is a poor adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, go to the store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
