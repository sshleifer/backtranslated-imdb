I know sometimes it's really really tacky ... But the acting is incredible and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I really love this show, and I'm almost embarrassed to do b / c the show has a rep. for being really tacky, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a very low budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with it ... As Sabrina's father is two different guys throughout the movie ... I mean, they could not they just tell him he was an uncle or something? Still, I can not help loving this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend if you are looking for some light and funny entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season's twists ... Once you start college, Morgan joins the group and their dialogue is painful and very poorly represented ... In addition she's ugly so the jokes about how she's just surviving on her good looks have been lost on me ... But I think it was meant to have a good eighth season and I was so sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled!
