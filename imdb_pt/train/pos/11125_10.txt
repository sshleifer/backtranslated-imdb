What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" literally redefined television as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is impeccable, the writing, the direction and, for me, above all, the acting. Watching this show you will realize that these characters are NOT real. The acting takes you to think that there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the program because it's violent, it's not all about violence, it's about business, family and many deeper things that depend on what you, as a fan sees. For me, I do not like it when people refer to the program, a program about the Mafia. For me, it's a family show. A family that, through the generations, is separated from the crowd. Overall, this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Stunning performance complex characters, magnificent story lines of brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different.
