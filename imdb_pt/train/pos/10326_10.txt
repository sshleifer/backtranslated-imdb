We always talk about movie landmarks - Kane, The Godfather, The Souffle Tour. A film, however, is often overlooked by "serious" movie critics. I'm talking plainly about the classic Doc Savage (M.oB). <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but it also explores seriously the issue of the exploitation of developing nations by US imperialism. Not to mention kung fu. <br /> <br /> He also possessed the greatest soundtrack in movie history (until, of course, Queen's breathtaking work on Flash Gordon). Although it's a rarity, it's worth looking for this movie - it will pay ten times for your research effort.
