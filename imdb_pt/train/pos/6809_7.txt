This was a very good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I did not want to take any chances. Anyway, near the end of the movie, the prosecutor reads one verse from the Bible and then quotes another from memory. I do not remember the first passage he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it's Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many people use to defend capital punishment. It's a shame that prosecutors do not dare quote the Bible today. Has anyone heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court judge in the history of this country? He said the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we lost that view in America.
