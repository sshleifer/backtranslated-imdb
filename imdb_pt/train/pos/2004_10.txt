I admit that I am a vampire addict: I have seen so many vampire movies that I have lost count and this is definitely among the top ten. I was very impressed with the original vampires of John Carpenter and when I discovered that there was a sequence, I went straight and bought. This movie does not obey the same rules as the first, and it's not so gloomy, but it's close enough and I felt it was well built in the original. Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was enjoyable and yet difficult enough for the viewer to believe that he could actually survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favorite parts was shortly after he meets Zoey and walks into the restaurant's bathroom to check if she is more than she seems. His comments are wonderfully irreverent and still eminently practical, which contrasts well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> The other cast members were also well chosen and did a good job producing an original and entertaining movie. It's not simply a replay of the first film and it grew in a similar way to the way Fright Night II came out of Fright Night. There are different elements that make a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend this. If you prefer your less bloody movies, choose something else.
