I liked it a lot. "The Revolution will not be televised." It gave me, once again, a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that in Venezuela the twenty percent of the wealthy citizens have made all the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when his coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman, the Electoral Boards and all Civil Rights, no one took the conspirators back from a barn somewhere and fired at them. They did not even go to jail. The biggest conspirators are living in Florida, continuing. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" approved by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It is not just history that bites. Democracy can give you a jump if you let it go. And in Venezuela he is released.
