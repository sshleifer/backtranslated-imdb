The premise may sound silly, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps relieve the public in this mix of mysticism and kidnapping. Excellent cast, particularly Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at its peak in the 80s in comedy / action. There is also a great F / X, a very surreal dream sequence and a rather original storyline. Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy's movies, but worth a look.
