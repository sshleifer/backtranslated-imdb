The bad scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, a man takes on a trained sniper squad and comes out victorious, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing his head Out of the monster ... Awesome. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the murders. Haha Good fun fun filled with predictable and laughable twists of a liner. I really liked this movie, but before I watch it, make sure to have a good laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it seriously. I can not, in my judgment, think this movie was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit and just enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie the way it should be enjoyed. Quite simply. So grab some popcorn and some beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. That brought a little joy to my life.
