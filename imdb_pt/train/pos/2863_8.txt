Although this show has been on the air since 1973, after watching a DVD I borrowed from our library, I felt compelled to say a little about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show. on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a small "Sunday Night Party" with friends to watch it on NBC on one of the few colorful televisions. <br /> <br /> I really like the story not so much about names and dates but how it influences us today and how both can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of silver, was named after a character named "Old Virginny", who, in the early days of the city, came out of a bar, fell and broke his bottle of whiskey. Old Virginny did not want to miss the occasion, just as the precious liquid was seeping into the earth, he decided to christen the town of "Virginia Town." The area became known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had a reputation for trying to jump at everyone's claim and the area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> I just watched an earlier episode with these 2 guys. Other episodes dealt with Mark Twain's literary rise as a Territorial Enterprise reporter ... It was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else commented, each episode would really be considered a movie by itself - rich scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that misrepresented the truth was the proximity to Virginia City and Ponderosa. In fact, to ride Ponderosa (all of northern Lake Tahoe), it would be necessary to mount your horse about 1,000 feet below the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley and then another 30-40 miles to the city of Virginia. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the Cartwrights would have some aching butts doing this on a regular basis. But every writer should have a little freedom with the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss this show, even today.
