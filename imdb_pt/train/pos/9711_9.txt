Well, I just found out that there's a more disgusting and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sickly British comedy about the most horrible, insane and disgusting town in the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem quite normal !! The format of the show is very much like Little Britain, except that it all revolves around the inhabitants of the infernal city. Both shows feature the same skits again and again in every episode and some obviously inspired "Little Britain" (particularly the job skit class). But the show differs because, although it is rude as "Little Britain" (hence not a show for children), the program has a quality of illness and sadistic that sets it apart from all of these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killings are recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you have not guessed, this is not a show for kids, easily offended or normal people and that's probably why I liked it. However, you really need very thick skin and a horrible love to enjoy it to the fullest. Funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief - you have to see it to believe.
