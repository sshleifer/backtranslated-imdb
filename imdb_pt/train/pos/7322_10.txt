Halloween is one of those movies that gets you on your skin! It's in my opinion the scariest movie ever. Michael Myers is the best boggart of all time! He was so terrifying! What made Halloween so special was that there were no special effects where you could tell how excited the computer was, it had a low budget and had a one note note, but managed to scare people hell. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as in 78. It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and many years later escapes from the mental institution. . Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to retrieve him, since he describes Michael as "... pure evil, the blackest eyes, the eyes of the Devil." Michael is on a mission to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween while her friends are partying and of course, we know the rules, they understand! But Laurie may have a chance since she's the virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays many respects to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is a fantastic movie that breaks boundaries and causes you to lock the doors, lock your windows and turn off the lights! "They'll get you! They'll get you!" Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
