What a fascinating movie. Even if it were not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a con man in his element. And it's the kind of cinema psychology that students could study to learn about compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, has been revealed as a media fraud, but this move really gives him ample opportunity. to clear her name. <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns she makes with the documentary filmmaker are staggering. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book, but I just heard good reviews and went to see it in the boring rainy afternoon. The journey of this film takes you to be smart, interesting and totally engaging.
