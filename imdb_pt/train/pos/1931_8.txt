A community pool in Connecticut is the setting for this "under the radar" movie that is charming, fun, entertaining and attractive. Although he won awards at major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released for hordes of theaters across America, but was distributed in DVD format and screened selectively. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that "The Big Bad Swim" has never had the exaggerated marketing of Hollywood, considering how many Hollywood sinkers this year launched, like "I Know Who Killed Me." "The Big Bad Swim," a genuinely good independent film, had to swim upstream on its own. <br /> <br /> However, in "The Big Bad Swim," actress Paget Brewster is captivating and credible as Amy, the point-to-point math teacher who is not only being abandoned by her husband, but is also about to lose his job, and ends up taking a new life. TV actor Jeff Branson - who is HOT - plays Noah, the serious and vulnerable swimming teacher who goes in the extra pool to help his students overcome their fears, and learns that he can learn from his students. Pretty, sexy Jess Weixler (I just saw her in a commercial bank?) Skillfully plays Jordan, the future swimmer who works two jobs, one as a dancer, the other as a blackjack dealer. Your character provides the catalyst for the change between the set, but is the least understandable of the characters, because of a lack of a "background story" or motivation why it does what it does. Jordan is young enough to still live at home with a younger brother, ubiquitous and with video camera, who spies her. However, your parents are not shown to get involved with your life in any way, which seems strange. There is no drunk mother or abusive parent here to explain why a normal, attractive girl from a suburban Connecticut would choose to be a self-medicating dancer who would go down to bachelor party parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this discussion, "The Big Bad Swim" is successful, in large part because it is a happy, very good movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, learning how to swim is the metaphor of life. Ultimately, it is better to jump with both feet and swim, instead of sitting on the deck, because life happens to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Big Bad Swim is a great date movie, a great movie. a great movie "what I did not see", and men like it as much as women.
