This film contains one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also, this movie is funny, but it also has a serious side. What is especially intriguing about this film is the character Madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but who eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from lover to political leader has greatly increased the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film is a struggling actor and a bit like a clown, also evolves and at the end of the film imposes respect. I liked this movie.
