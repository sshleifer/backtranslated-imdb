Conrad Hall came out with a crash. The great filmmaker ended his illustrious career with this film before moving on. He prided himself on being one of the cutest cop movies you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Of course the performance is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing on the tracks! The amount of action here is also correct: not much; <br /> <br /> None of the characters here, frankly, are "good guys," since Hanks is a professional killer to town boss, Newman. Hanks's only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to end up with a killer like him, even though he teaches him to be the escape man in robberies! As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is the director of photography Hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens. Your job is simply fantastic.
