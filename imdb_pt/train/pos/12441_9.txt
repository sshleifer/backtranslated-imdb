This was the modesty we did not know! It was suggested and summarized in the comic book for trade unions to sell to the newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who received The Dream Job - tell a story of Modesty that fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they made changes to their origin to make the story more peaceful. The "purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she said to Miklos was true because she was "wasting time." I did not rent or borrow the DVD as other "reviewers" did, I bought! And I do not want a refund! I watched it three times and did not sleep! Great dialogue and well-designed characters that I cared about (even the evil Miklos) as in novels and comic books! I also can not wait for the next Modesty movie (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's to come!
