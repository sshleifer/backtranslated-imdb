I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival where he was playing in the Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I went to this movie was because it shared its name with Radiohead's music, and also because my friend had bought the tickets, so I really had no choice: -DI was hoping to be something like The Silence of the Innocents, but ended up being a semic√≥rnido film. Someone has mentioned that none of the characters are nice, and that's absolutely correct. I really could not care less if the Powerful character had his guts ripped off by Creep. I was hoping the homeless would go out alive with the Potente character getting only desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but again, the purpose of the movie was to scare him and did so quite efficiently. The score of a Bristol band called The Insects was top notch. This, more than anything else, really scared me. The director was a really decent guy and quite entertaining during the question and answer session. I really hope he can make better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for fans of the genre, but I recommend that non-fans do it anyway. It was a fun ride.
