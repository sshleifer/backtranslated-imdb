"Der Todesking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you happy ?? The second cult monument of Jörg Buttgereit in sequence, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", there are seven short episodes ?? One for each day of the week? revolving the suicides of unrelated people. Among these already disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts really gruesome images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes are not all equally powerful, but as a healthy, "Der Todesking" is at the top of the list of the most depressing films of all time. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a strange total in the park, and Sunday's, focusing on a younger man bothering himself to death, are extremely intense and devastating to watch. The added value of this film, or any other shock like this, is debatable and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any kind of message to communicate here. There is a vague mention of a mysterious chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but most of the time we remain uninformed about the motivations of these people to end their lives in such a dramatic way. Completely different from what I expected, "Der Todesking" is not exploratory or repulsively graphic! On the contrary, I could never have expected Buttgereit to be so subtle and thoughtful about the picture of pure human misery. Thursday's episode is a perfect example of this, as it elegantly displays different views of a famous German bridge, while the names, ages and occupations of people who jumped appear on the screen. The values ​​of production are inescapably poor and editing often lacks professionalism, but that is not really what counts in this type of cinema. Is the subject strong and forcing us to contemplate on the less cheerful? but also indispensable? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music too!
