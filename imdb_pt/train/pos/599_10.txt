I really liked this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in acting. The writing was top notch. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and someone can actually play Davy, but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person. who led Mexico in turbulent times. <br /> <br /> Although some may think the film was slow, it captured the battle as it unfolded, much boredom followed by a few hours of horrible terror. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think of a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. Nowadays, when nobody represents anything, I find it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about the politics of the time.
