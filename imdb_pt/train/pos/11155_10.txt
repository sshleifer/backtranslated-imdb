Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking he'll make a living as a stallion. He arrives there and quickly discovers that it will not be easy - he goes through a degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope he meets Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they try to survive and leave town and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, disturbing but fascinating film. Director John Schelsinger paints a very grungy portrait of New York and its inhabitants. That way, it's dated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but it's now pretty clean. He also uses all the camera tricks in the book - the color turning into black and white; sequences of travel dreams; forward; flash backs (especially involving rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... his name. It keeps you disoriented and careless - but I could not stop watching. <br /> <br /> There is not much history - it basically focuses on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot type shows this). It's just a portrait of two spoiled characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel and urban jungle. <br /> <br /> Originally, it was rated X in 1969 - the only reason is that the MPAA did not think parents would want their kids to see it. However, it was a big hit among high school students (at that time, X did not want anyone under 17). It was also the only X rated film to win an Oscar for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight went to acting awards as it was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the photo for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! He was eventually downgraded to an R (uncut) when it was reissued in 1980. Also the great song "Everybody's Talkin '" was featured in this movie - and it became a big hit. A great movie - but very dark. I'm giving it a 10. I do not see it on commercial TV - it's cut into tapes and incomprehensible.
