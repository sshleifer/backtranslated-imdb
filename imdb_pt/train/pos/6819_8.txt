I found 'Time At The Top' a fun and stimulating experience. The performance, while generally not brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film obviously aimed at the youngest, it is certainly one of the best works of its kind (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, the UK and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for kids, and 'Time At The Top' does nothing to disregard this theory! I do not think continuity and good acting are important to young people. A good plot and an imaginative script are much more important to them. Both are in abundance in this film. The special effects are good, without harming the story, or driving viewers away from their own imaginations. It would have been very easy to inject an SFX overhead into this movie, but it would have totally destroyed all of his 'Raison D'etre'. <br /> <br /> Camera settings and work are of a very high standard in this film and complement refined wardrobe and historical accuracy. Overall, this movie is highly satisfying, and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those who try, like me! Now I need to read the original book as soon as possible.
