Well, first of all I would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is a part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated means "to protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> In addition, the Tamil film industry is quite full of purely commercial endeavors, any film by Rajnikanth or Vijay would be testament to that statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly very impressive in the final scene, especially love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). The gore is a bit much at times, but certainly this is a great movie!
