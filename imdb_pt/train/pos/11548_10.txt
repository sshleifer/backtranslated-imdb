Based on Neil Simons' film The Odd Couple, it tells the story of best friends Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) who end up sharing the huge Oscar bachelor after Felix tries to kill himself. <br /> <He had a big fight with his wife because of his obsessive compulsive cleansing and strange phobias, and sends a suicidal telegram. She calls Oscar and tells him what happened. Felix appears at the Oscars during his weekly poker game with his friends. Vinnie (John Fielder) Murray, the cop (Herbert Edelman) Roy (David Sheiner) and Speed ​​(Larry Haines). After some side collapse, it was clear that Felix will stay with Oscar. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film focuses on how these two characters are completely different. And also to see if Oscar can withstand the truly strange and unique habits and cleaning of Felix, and if Felix can defend Oscar as a goofy and his laid back attitude towards everything. Really a movie about two complete opposites living together and the joys, highs, lows and need of the gift that is friendship.With great clever acting and a very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British pigeon sisters Oscar invites to a double date. <br /> <br /> This is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is invaluable and Jack and Walter are fantastic with great chemistry. Also made into a successful and equally funny TV series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall like Felix.
