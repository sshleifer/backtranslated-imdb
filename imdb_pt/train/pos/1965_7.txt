I found this movie very good in all areas. The acting was brilliant of all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character gets smarter and more psychologically distorted by the minute. The plot is interesting, though, this movie is more for the mind that plays between the main characters and as Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists to her novels. The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller as masterpiece. Go see this movie now, it deserves better than what it received from the audience, who was fooled by some terrible comments about the movie (Before we even started) ..... You will not regret it if you go and see it. ..
