This film captures the absurd essence of an authoritarian American patriot actor - who believes his work (and politics) is as crucial to the American people as the president's own views. Alan Bates captures this mentality perfectly like Michael Baytes, and I will remember immensely of Bates as this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable piece of film that is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control of the will of the actors and countless external forces. Wonderfully, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject matter it portrays: Peter O'Brian runs with precision and total control, and commands both the serious backstage part of the film and the movie within himself. the film "Flight to Bogot√°" with clarity and discernment. If you are interested in the wit and strength of Canadian cinema, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
