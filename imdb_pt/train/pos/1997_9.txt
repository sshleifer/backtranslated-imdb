As a lifelong fan of Dickens, I have always been disappointed with adaptations of his novels. Although his works presented an extremely accurate reinterpretation of human life on every level of Victorian Britain, throughout all of them a penetrating thread of humor that could be both playful and sarcastic as the narrative dictated. In a way, he was a caricaturist and literary cartoonist. He could be serious and fun in the same sentence. He stung pride, satirized arrogance, celebrated modesty, and sympathized with loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a popular writer. <br /> <br /> And it's the comedy that often lacks in your interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is being dramatized as a series on BBC television. All misery and cruelty are theirs, but they are not of humor, of irony and of wild ridicule. The result is only a dark and somber experience: the story written by a journalist and not by a novelist. Not really Dickens. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!', on the other hand, is much closer to the mark. The scorn of the ruling party is perfectly interpreted, from the raucous bully to the drunken magistrate. The classic impasse between beadle and mr. Brownlow, in which the law is described as "idiot, idiot" could not be better done. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But blinding cruelty is also present, the insensitive indifference of the state, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are presented with the same certainty that the Master would wish. <br /> <br /> And then there's crime. Ron Moody is a treasure trove like the despicable Jewish fence, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. Perhaps not surprisingly, Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from the far east of London - takes a liberty with Fagin by reinterpreting him as a much more benign subject than Dicken's original. In the novel, he was utterly ruthless, sending some of his own boys to the gallows in order to protect himself (though he was also caught and hanged). While in the film, he is portrayed as a disobedient paternal figure, a kind of charity thief rather than a corruptor of children, the latter being a long-standing anti-Semite sentiment. Otherwise, very few freedoms are taken with the Dickens original. All the most memorable elements are included. Only enough threat and violence is maintained to ensure narrative fidelity, while allowing the sensitivity of children. Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye escapes by drowning, and Bill Sykes receives a faithfully graphic eulogy. <br /> <br /> All music is excellent, although lean towards the schmaltz. Mark Lester lends me wonderfully. Both his scene and my favorite is the one in which the world comes to life "who will buy". It's weird, but it's Dickens from one side to the other. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could praise the wonderful scenarios, the contrast between rich and poor. There is a high quality performance of more regular British than you could shake a stick at. <br /> <br /> I should give 10 points, but I'm feeling more like Scrooge today. Enjoy your Christmas dinner. No original was better perceived.
