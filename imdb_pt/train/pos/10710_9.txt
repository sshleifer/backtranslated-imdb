I really have to disagree with guys who (if he had watched the entire movie) would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish scenery (some of the best ever ever filmed in Skye) and found a film with a difficult beginning coming together in a pungent whole. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. On the contrary, it is a film that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can not say how much the 'standard' movies annoy me - pushing the same polished material over and over again. Seachd does not seem to be about that. It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish movie. <br /> <br /> OK, so the acting is not a blockbuster. That's because the actors are seemingly real people. I really thought that the main roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes extraordinarily beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really does have a second view, as there are many topics that become clearer the second time around - In general, the combination of music and (sometimes) impressive visuals, plus a community approach to the acting and non-normal structure, transformed the Seachd into a quite distinct and distinctive style. memorable movie. More of these please!
