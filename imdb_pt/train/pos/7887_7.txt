If you are a fan of Freddy hard then you may not like. This seems to be a parody of the nightmare series. There is not much to see here. The only reason for this is the story of Freddy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always good at Nightmare movies is the death scenes. But the death scenes were very bad. The visual effects were great and the acting was good, but the background story was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story comes to an end. <br /> <br /> I read bad comments about it, but I really enjoyed it despite its many flaws: 1. A nightmare on elm street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy is Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Master of Dreams. (7/10) 4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend you enjoy the series. This is where Freddy is fully explained, but that's all there is. Then on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
