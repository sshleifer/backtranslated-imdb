This is a great time! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding teamed up to make a powerful and influential movie. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in getting his certification in the hands of a racist diver. Along the way, he must also face the old intolerance of all his classmates, none of whom wants him in his class. They leave the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and starts to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this one! It is a great tale of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we watch racism dissipate slowly and everyone begins to respect men, one at a time.
