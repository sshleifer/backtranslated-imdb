While this may not necessarily be a movie called "classic" by today's standards, it's still worth seeing. The main reason is because after experiencing this movie, you have the feeling that you also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60's, no matter how good or bad. It happened to see this filmed in an English literature class at SUNY Geneseo, and although at first it seems to be just a nonsense composition of the 1960s icons, the film is far from simply being "played together" ". <br /> <br /> My point is that if you leave the movie unsatisfied and confused, the movie did its job: it conveyed a bleak vision of the future that makes you insecure and angry. It was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to exploit in the youth it exemplified. As such, "Zabriskie Point" may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters may be unilateral and predictable. However, it also conveys so well this kind of clich√©d and rebellious desire to get out of existence that both Mark and Daria must share. Even anti-establishment students are just as inauthentic as the government against which they rebel.
