This very good movie pops with tension. The bets are of course high - will the police and Widmark, a public health doctor, arrest criminals who do not know they are carrying the plague before a large-scale epidemic erupts? But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, between the thugs played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying man whom Palance believes to be the subject of a hunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity between Widmark and his wife, and the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid panic on a grand scale. The film is beautifully filmed by Kazan on extraordinarily well-choreographed footage in New Orleans, and ends at an impressive climax, where Palance flees like a mouse from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city. The commentary is superb, probably the best I've ever heard, covering cinematography, framing and lighting scenes, production design, the cast of non-professional actors in small roles, and the ironies and parallels in the plot, such as an insightful seminar about cinematographic techniques from the 1950s and film noir in general. Watch once to enjoy the movie on your own and, if you are interested in making movies, a second time with the commentary to learn.
