This movie shows you do not need big bangs, billion dollar computer graphics, or highly paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is a great story and plot. who master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa brilliantly draws. I recommend this movie for everyone who loves an epic epic piece. and for those who like Kurosawas, previous works. 10/10
