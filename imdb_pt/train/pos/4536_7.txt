Written by the writer who wrote the excellent series Murder Rooms, which chronicled ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, I was anxious for it and was not disappointed. It was rather slow, with much emphasis on Doyle's frustration in Sherlock Holmes, which was very accurate and very well portrayed. It was an interesting and beautifully filmed character study (in digital video, unusual for a play of the period). The acting was excellent in all respects, particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who played the ACD, whose name I do not remember, has impressed me without end. An excellent character study that has roughly the same amount of twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See this if you get the chance
