I saw this movie for the first time on some movie channel (HBO?) For some time. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other previous raps and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promotion caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right away I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) And I was right. Only the parody songs make this movie worth watching (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You have to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three NWH members. Who can forget Tone Deaf itching with his ass? It is very bad that this film has not received the credit it deserved, because it was overshadowed by the CB4 during its releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and love the gangster rap of the '90s, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you do not like or do not like rap, you'll enjoy jokes at the expense of the genre.
