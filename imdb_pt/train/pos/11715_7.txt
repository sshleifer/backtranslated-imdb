This is a cute spoof / comedy comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. This was designed to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up on the NBC Network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to present the baby busty in black, but unfortunately the sitcom never passed the pilot stage because of their sexual references. This movie, however, is a lot of fun. Elvira is the modern Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one liners. This film was followed, a few years later, by the awful "Elvira's Haunted Hills", which intended to take off from the old Roger Corman films, but fell flat on the floor. Watch this movie for a much more fun experience!
