I do not know the stars, or modern Chinese teenage music - but I know a completely entertaining movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it is played to laugh, out of love, and is a great mix of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to have a lot of fun doing it - production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks brighter than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school just to be kicked out and then discover stardom as a basketball piece (and love and more etc.) is great - this is new, fun, and immensely fun. <br /> <br /> With lots of action and a good dialogue, this is simply to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money it was one of the best family movies we've been seeing for a long time <br /> < please ignore the negative comments and give Dunk a try - we were very happy we did - a good sports comedy movie.
