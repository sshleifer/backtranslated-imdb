Standard rise to the tale of fame that has some high points. Number one, Lonette McKee as the sister who gives a dizzying and dizzying performance. The fact that it has never become a great sensation after that is beyond me. Unfortunately, she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on the insipid character of Irena Carter, Sparkle, whose rise to fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, whenever the girls go on stage and perform, the movie comes to life. The original song by Curis Mayfield should be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The image quality was very low, as well as the production values ​​I'm guessing. All in all, it's worth a goose.
