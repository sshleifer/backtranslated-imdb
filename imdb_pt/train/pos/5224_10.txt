Ayone who lamented about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot should have searched for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! this movie was meant to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot of any form or format. I'd also like to remind those whiners that if you're going to snub this movie, it looks like they're missing the point. This movie is clearly made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor", which seems to me just a pile of dirty crap. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more grateful that the sense of humor some people may not agree with on their own before firing their mouth. Thank you
