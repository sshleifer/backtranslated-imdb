I think the movie was kind of weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. He is not mentioned again. The special effects could also be better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. Not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give about 5 out of 10 of the scale.
