This movie was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 years in 2007. I watched it again last night, not having seen it since high school. While it was full of feelings of the 30's and the acting was a bit stereotyped, however, it was superb. The story of Pearl S. Buck came to life through the chemistry magic of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel that won Mrs. Buck the Nobel Prize for Literature comes to life under the baton of Sydney Franklin, who along with an excellent script tells the story of peasant Wang Lung, whose father gets a bride to him, a kitchen slave. of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is supported by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and by the love of the land. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like the land, is the source of her wealth, happiness, and immortality. Buck's stories have always had strong women at a critical point in influencing the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise Rainer gives life to a tempting but determined Chinese peasant in her interpretation of Olan. Muni also captures the na√Øve but honored Wang, eventually trapped between the two worlds of the rich and the peasants. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Kansan Uncle Henry, Dorothy Gale, Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as uncle and Keye Luke as the Number One Son, but this time not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch over and over again and never get bored. If this is indeed the case, this film is a classic, without a doubt.
