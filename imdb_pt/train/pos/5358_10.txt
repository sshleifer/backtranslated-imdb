This is one of the great 80's movies in my collection that I think of all the time. Running Man is one of the best and most different Arnold movies to date and when I first saw The Running Man, I was so excited to see a movie like this. I love all the fights and this is really a special movie. He also has Jesse Ventura, the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. who always seems to enjoy death in their movies because he has been killed in films such as Universal Soldier, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and others. All Arnold fans should love this movie from the beginning to the end because their action is star-studded, and it's one of Arnold's best to date!
