I did not see the BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show, but I could not get into it. However, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday felt a little lost so I decided to watch the pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show and the only side effect he had on me is that now I want to watch BSG as well. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked is that I did not have to be an unconditional BSG fan to understand what's going on in Caprica. From what I read on the net, they were trying to reach the female population since the BSG reached many more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do this from the beginning, starting with the pilot.
