Stack should have received the Oscar for that performance, period. It's a crime he did not do. Incredible how he humanizes a worthless rich character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance. Actually, the whole performance in this movie is excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a taxi ride, then a plane ride, and then continues to move on an emotional ride that will capture all your interest. You'll have fun! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a cheeky novel. 100% one-dimensional soap. You can call it ultimate soap, because acting triumphs completely over the material. He acted in an excellent, well-managed way, but strictly within his soap genre. I would not even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). While not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director could have achieved with more substantial subjects.
