Who would have thought such a dark film could be so scary and touching? I am very impressed. It's a shame more people have not seen it. I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. And that premiere in the direction of Bernard Rose! I still wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well. Well, regardless, I love the interpretative potential that it has. Everything and everyone in Anna's dreams (played by Charlotte Burke) represent a real conflict in your life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. It's the many details like these that make the movie so good for repeated views. I hope I come across another little film loaded with emotion and psychological meaning like this soon.
