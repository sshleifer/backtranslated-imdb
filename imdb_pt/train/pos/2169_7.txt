Ok, first of all, ignore the last person 'review. They admit to falling asleep through it, so it's no wonder they did not understand what was happening !!! As thriller / horror go, this movie is not too bad, it is certainly very watchable. Since the opening scenes, you have a general idea of ​​exactly what will be the cause of all the folly that follows, and comes the end where you are proven that everything is being cleared up. <br /> <br /> I liked that. movie, it was rather strange at times and as old movies go was passable. Great for late night viewing! I give a generous 7 out of 10.
