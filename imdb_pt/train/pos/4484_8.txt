Released a few months before the end of the war, "Anchors Aweigh" is one of Gene Kelly's greatest musical triumphs of the 1940s? <br /> <br /> Under the direction of George Sidney, had the benefits of a nice score, and the best of all Gene Kelly's services in his first MGM lead role ?? The previous year, in Columbia's Cover Girl, he had revealed an innovative approach to on-screen dancing, a soft but pleasing voice and considerable charm in "Anchors Aweigh," despite being hired by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson. he was laying the solid foundation for his most revealing years at MGM ?? <br /> <br /> The story of the film, a kind of drought for "On the Town" four years later, follows the mariners Kelly and Sinatra on land leave, spend their vacation in Hollywood, where they get involved in matters of an aspiring singer (Grayson) and his nephew (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> Grayson, it seems, has his heart set on an audition with maestro and pianist Jose Iturbi?

(of the fame of "Tom and Jerry"). Delicious and innovative, he deftly combines live action and animation in his tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a Navy Sailor of Pomerania, wearing a striped shirt and beret, shows how to dance ??? "Look at me, I'm dancing!" says the king of the merry rat ...
