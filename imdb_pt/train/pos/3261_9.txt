No Sayers in this movie are probably bitter of some seriously unrequited love. This is a great movie for anyone who can understand the music of Johnny Mathis, or any song from that era: Bobby Darin, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz, The Girl From Ipanema, and others ... <br /> /> I measure movies by how often I have to watch them before I am satisfied ... Chances have come back to me some good times. <br /> <br /> I also watch the synergy between the cast .. I thought they worked well together. <br /> <br /> Open your heart, and let the comic magic of the movie carry you. <br /> <br /> Alan
