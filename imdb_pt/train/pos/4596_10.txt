This is the best Jackie Chan movie, and my personal favorite. After the disappointing USA made 'The Protector', directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and put it in Hong Kong. This is also probably Jackies' most violent film, with the audience shrinking into bone-crushing acrobatics. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his team really put as much effort into the fight project. Bones were broken and blood spilled in the process of making this movie as you will see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple case of cops and thieves, nothing special, after all it was written around the film. action. I must say that the English version has some voiceovers, but that should not put it too far. <br /> <br /> So, get the boys, pop the beers and enjoy. By the way, the movie was dubbed 'Glass Story' by the stunt team. Because? I'll let you figure it out for yourself !!
