H.G. Wells Classic had several incarnations. The 5 'Speilburg version and the classic version of 53' But this alone remains completely true to the book. Nothing is changed nothing is removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3 hour movie. The director cut the film in 2 hours of pure excellence. It has a chapter-by-chapter view of the pages of novels that "Wells would be proud of" The story is how everyone remembers. Martians Invade Earth with Capsules containing an army of War Machines that walk on Tripod. Earth people of the 19th century are ill-equipped to repel alien forces and retaliate with cannons and cannons that shoot the Walkers, and when humanity is no longer a world power they are saved by the least of Earth's organisms. The film is an excellent achievement for director Timothy Hines, who has great potential in bringing that vision to life with a meager $ 5 million budget. Today, B-Movies has bigger budgets.
