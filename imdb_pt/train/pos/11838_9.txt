This is one of the most calming, relaxing and wonderful animation films I have ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the film, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not great just for kids, but also for adults. Teach him lessons, never forget who you are, you can do what you want, brave and bold. This movie can make you cry too, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the verge of your place! Some movies really give you a confused feeling after you see them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my 9/10 vote for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, this gave me a lot of spirit!
