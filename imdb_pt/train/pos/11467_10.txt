This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. Not only is this the best film of its kind (school shooting) The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to shoot was magnificent. He filmed using teenage actors who were still in high school. He filmed in the actors' own rooms and used the real parents actors as his parents in the movie. Also the actors were filming also using camcorders making it look much more like a video diary. It's almost artistic (if that's even a word) However, there are some glitches, for example, when Cal calls brads (?) Land rover a range rover (or vice versa, it's been some time since I've seen it)
