May 2004, Wonderland is relatively new in the UK. Brilliant movie from a real brutal story. If you've known LA since the early 1980's, you'll appreciate how well it's captured. The use of the elements that make up his cinematographic style is original, extending the experience and bringing the viewer closer to reality. The use of a disconnected "Pulp Fiction" timeline makes it possible to explore the uncertainty about what actually happened, while the direction and performance of the cast demanded attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I was distributing them.
