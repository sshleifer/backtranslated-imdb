I really liked this movie. He has managed to do something that few movies do now; provided family values ​​while I entertained myself. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls. The girls I liked were very fond of the movie and kept talking about Nancy when we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think parents will be bored sitting in the theater. No, it will not win an Oscar and it did not have magnificent special effects, or even provide a frighteningly scary mystery, but it entertained me and remained faithful to the spirit of the books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a young lady (she'll love it!) Or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.
