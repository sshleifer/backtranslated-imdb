Intelligent, brave, witty, fast, sexy, flamboyant, sloppy, erotic, sincere and corny, Footlight Parade is a first class entertainment, what movies are about. <br /> <br /> The realistic, satirical treatment gives a new edge to the material and its pace and delivery of line are breathtaking. Think they only started making feature films 7 years before that! The brilliance of the dialogue can not be equaled anywhere else today, especially considering that "realism" has taken hold and involved contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was made at a time when Hayes's bar code was being ignored and the result is a new, self-referential, critical, and alive cinema that speaks directly to contemporary audiences who suffer from the depression and the general anguish of the time. I would recommend watching any movie from that period, from 1930 to 1935, for a vision of what popular cinema can be.
