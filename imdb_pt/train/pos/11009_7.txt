There was an elegant approach to this film from director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. It was also encouraging to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu take on leadership roles and expand their reach as artists. This film also included one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes in recent years. The efforts of the director and actors have combined into an effective thriller. Although the plot of the film was complicated, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and dishonesty were revealed. In 1949, George Orwell in his famous novel "1984" suggested that the future would be governed by the totalitarian state, which would control minds and diminish human freedom. It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the state, but the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
