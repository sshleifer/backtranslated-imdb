I am a fan of Crash and Blade Runner and this movie explores some of the themes of death and 80 noir movies that I like to watch, so I liked it. In general, essential stupidity The protagonist of the film noir is not very well drawn by the female protagonist and his hero is almost a Neanderthal, hence the kitch's warning.
