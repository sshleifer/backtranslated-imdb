Many of the user comments I've seen on IMDB for this movie do not do it justice. First of all, let me just say that this movie should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a fun but stupid movie, which does not require you to think, just for fun. If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in the movies or in the mood, you will be very disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a silly movie with some talented actors / actresses, and some good phrases then you will have fun.
