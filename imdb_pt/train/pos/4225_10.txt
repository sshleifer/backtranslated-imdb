Ruth Gordon is one of the most comprehensive killers Columbo ever had to deal with. And the plot is ingenious all around. This is one of the best episodes of Columbus of all time. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin excel in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk offers something extra in his scenes with Gordon.
