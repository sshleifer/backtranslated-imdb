This is the first Tom Hanks movie that I had the privilege of seeing in the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard he was going to play a killer, I was a bit stunned thinking "Mr. Hanks can take it"? And he did in high fashion. This 1930's depression-era movie is about loyalty, redemption, and a path you do not want your kids to stumble across. Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast as Michael Sullivan. Being the family man and the secret life of the assassin hired by Oscar nominee Paul Newman. This film, Tom Hanks, is based more on reactions and looks than on dialogues, which he does a knockout performance. <br /> <br /> On one night of one of his works, Michael's son, Michael Jr., played by rookie Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses the hit. And Michael's partner in crime, actor Daniel Craig can not have that information. So he ends up with the son of Michael Sr., except Michael Jr. So the two go to Chicago for Conner Rooney (son of Rooney, of Paul Newman). <br /> <br /> The drama and the intense plot really thickens as the father tries to get things right, even if the son is together for the ride. While on this mortal journey, someone hired a success for Michael Sr. The killer would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a tooth-stained Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The movie will make you feel the old days. And with the beautiful and astonishing soundtrack of Thomas Newman to accompany you, you can not help but appreciate this movie from Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. So sit back and enjoy the wild ride.
