This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film relates to real life and how drugs can play an important role. Although this movie seems to be produced from a low budget, I found it stimulating to watch. <br /> <br /> Some may not like the story and say that the script is without direction. However, when a person delves into both drugs and these characters, there is no direction for life. I feel that this film is an accurate representation of what can happen to a person if he is confronted with extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast is new to the industry. However, they all did very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and enter the character appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a good tool when dealing with a loved one or person who is involved with drugs and seems to be spiraling. out of control. This movie may scare you enough to change your ways.
