Also known as "Water Lilies," this movie tells the story of two girls struggling to enter the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and this works very well. It gives a lot of time and space to know the different characters and to grow a little linked to them. <br /> <br /> Using a small cast puts extra pressure on people playing, as they all have more time on the screen. than normal, but the people who play in this movie deal well with it. Everyone is completely believable. The visual scene is great, especially the underwater photos in the pool add a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been made on the same subject, and this one does not stand out in any of them. It pulls some "standard" pressure methods out of the top hat and works on them. Not bad, not at all, but not great, and I think it might have been better if it had taken some less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 synchronous swimmers
