This game is awesome. Really, you should get it if you have not. Although it is old now, it was amazing when it came out. I believe that this game will always be a classic. It's as good as a Super Mario World. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat him, which we ended up doing. It's not as advanced as the Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan of Mario, it's essential. It's fun fun and challenging. Everything you could want from a fantasy game, except for good graphics, (well, it came out in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
