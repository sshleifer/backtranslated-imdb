Documentaries of this type are often very opinionated. This movie seems to take away all opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It's sad the conditions that these poor people have to work with, this movie does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops. The film Mardi Gras: Made in China was a good way to show the world how stingy a party can affect the lives of so many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch a movie for an English class, where we spent time talking about the sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them, and this movie helped make the topic roll. It was a great, very informative film and I recommend that someone see it, it kind of opens your eyes.
