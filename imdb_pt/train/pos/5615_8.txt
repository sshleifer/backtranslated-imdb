A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski acts well as the shy introvert, trying to adapt to his gloomy Parisian quarters and his fellow guests. Horrifying from the start because of the apparent stinginess and self-obsessed and restless later, as he develops his defenses that will ultimately be his undoing. Personally, I could have done without the cross dressing element, but I accepted the nod to Psycho and the fact that he had some logic, keeping in mind the plot. However, it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but perhaps this was done because the patio certainly seems to have the appearance of a theater at the end. I can not help but feel that there are more than a few of the director's feelings of not being a "real" Frenchman and a Jew. Still, there is much to enjoy here, including a good performance of a beautiful look Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as dependable as ever.
