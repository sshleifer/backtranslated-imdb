I was so surprised at how great The Man In The Moon really was. I mean, at first I was sort of expecting a predictable and tacky movie, but I decided to put that aside while watching. Well, when it was over I was left stunned (mostly in tears), by how big The Man In The Moon turned out to be. This movie is so fun and is so aware of its tone, and it's just a fabulous movie. , especially Reece Witherspoon (who was so handsome and kind), and everyone. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the ending somewhat predictable, but very well done. I also felt some simple things or as if they had been made. before, but it's still a great movie. Overall, I must say that I do not have much to say about this movie, not that it was bad, it's just a movie that you like or dislike. However, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like that kind of movie, it's still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 Stars
