I own Ralph Baks, his forgotten masterpiece, Fire & Ice, in an old OOP rental videotape. <br /> <br /> Well, on the one hand, this is better than any other Conan movie you've ever seen. Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? He resisted the test of time, and the only way he started to look tacky is in comparison to modern fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (although I love this movie). The plot is like this: after a battle between Fire & Ice, a daughter of kings is kidnapped by Jarols (Ice) subhuman creatures, while a single survivor from a victim village rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yes, this does not sound like an original as a nurse. Betty, but that's not the point. It really is to bring to life an interesting idea of ​​a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> As for the action scenes: superb. They are well managed, have great suspense and have many loud noises. Just check the climatic battle, now that is an end! <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue: competent. Same. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are fine and do not get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is very good. Shot in 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many of the backgrounds look really detailed and well-designed, and although the character designs look a little dimensional, they're good. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a little neglected gem and will entertain you more than any of the superficial "entertainments". 10/10
