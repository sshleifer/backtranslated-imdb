It's not a movie to be taken seriously, but a great movie, though. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. The acting, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that you would not go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time it appears by cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance. - - - - - - - -
