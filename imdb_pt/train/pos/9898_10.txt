My 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you have decided that you liked "Slaughter High" even before watching. Yes, it's the typical revenge story - several years after a dirty joke, but how come you do not like some of the stuff they pull here? I could not have predicted the bathtub scene in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Well, that does not pretend. It's the kind of movie the "Scream" characters probably watched, and that contributed to their rules on surviving a horror movie. After all, who does not like to see people suffering for doing these things? Obviously, it has a somewhat reactionary tone, since people are punished for doing what the 1960s advocated. But still, you have to love these things! So, with apologies to Don McLean, this fool did not sing to the king and queen!
