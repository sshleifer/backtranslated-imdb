The film really has a pretty good story, but it gets stuck in several important places. It's almost as if the director plays the movie together without having time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but he's clearly missing something from several key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie. And it probably would have been a much better movie if it did not feel like being played together. <br /> <br />
