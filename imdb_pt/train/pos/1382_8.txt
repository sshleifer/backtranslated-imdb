Not everything is said in this excellent first feature by Céline Sciamma. Friendship, "wanting to fit in", the first sexual feelings ... All this and more is sublimated through underwater scenes of synchronized swimming. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It is a much less violent approach to understanding adolescence compared to, say, "Thirteen", but a very interesting journey, however. <br /> <br /> A must see, and please leave all American cinematic biases at the door. The soundtrack is A +, by the way. <br /> <br /> Bon cinéma!
