Although the recent recount of part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt has been fun once, "Iphigenia" with the incandescent Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Unfolding yourself in a natural environment with Greek actors speaking your own language lends such authenticity. A chance encounter with this film on one of DirecTV's many movie channels made me interested despite my concentration problems. There is no glitter or "bling" in this movie, just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real feels that they are spying on a royal family in turmoil. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of that fact. <br /> <br /> JLH
