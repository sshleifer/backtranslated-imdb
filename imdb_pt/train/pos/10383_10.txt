I saw this movie in 1976, my first year in New York. I lived there for the next 26 years, but I have never seen anything as delicate and beautiful as this little TV movie. It was part of a PBS series, as I remember, and I've never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes, just delicate, thrilling, extraordinarily touching moments filled with tension and excitement, all set in a conservative setting in Boston (I think), World War 1, where women played the role of the dedicated wife waiting for the husband's return from war, and did not seek a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain excels as a career photographer and spent the next 30 years looking for her in equally challenging roles without success. <br /> <br /> There must be a video of that movie? Of course it should be on DVD, but certainly at least one video?
