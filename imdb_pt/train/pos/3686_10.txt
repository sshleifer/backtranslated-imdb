Diane and I saw this fabulous movie today in Fremantle and we both agreed that from the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest. I say this because we were delighted with the brief five to ten minute segments that made up the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course this theme was love in its many forms. <Br /> <br /> Ostensibly the film took place in the various districts of Paris thus giving a particular flavor to each segment. Having been in Paris only several times, I did not know enough to recognize the places promptly, but I am sure that Europeans, and particularly the French, could easily recognize the places in the city. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into each story because of its production excellence, so that these places of the city diminish as a result. The movie moves quickly and the viewer is taking in a scene while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not so much like some Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and provocative and kind as most of life without the media band that buries so much the beauty of life under the nearest manure just to sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you like and let this little magical movie bathe you as a spa treatment and when you leave my guess, you will feel refreshed.
