My first child was born the year this show was released, and I played the album for the boys every Christmas after that. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still gave it to friends and relatives when they started families ... which invariably became their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (made on DVD-R of video tapes, probably) for sale on eBay. What I bought was an excellent copy, and it was great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs as the show. But both the CD and the DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment of all time.
