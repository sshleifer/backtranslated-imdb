Although structured entirely differently from the book by Tim Krabbe, who wrote the original "The Vanishing" (Spoorloos), it has the same general feel except for Koolhoven's less commercial and lyrical style. The start is great, the middle is good, but the sting is at the end. An emotional ending surprise. As you can read in several magazines, there is some sex in the movie, but everything is done very well. Never explicit, but very hot and sometimes even moody. It's a shame that American films can not be as honest as this. Where Dutch films tend to exceed the limit when it comes to this subject, 'De Grot' always stays within the confines of good taste. 'De Grot' tells an incredible story that spans more than 30 years. When you leave the cinema, you will be moved. What can we ask for more than one movie? Anyway, this movie still gives more ....
