This came by surprise. . the impact and resolution that this movie had in my automatic way of being reactive to people and situations. More vividly was the frenzy of the rage of emotion. Much like the way a spoiled child would be reacting to not getting what they wanted. . . a tantrum if you want. To think that I was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What was this costing me? So much love. . Lots of blesses. Now I am present for how incredible I feel to humble myself and have a continuous attitude of gratitude for life. . .for what is happening at the moment, without my wild expectations that life is a particular way, the way I think life or people "should" be. This film has contributed to the freedom I feel now from connecting with others, without limits and expectations. . and connect with genuine love. . without fear of loss. . Just love first and accept what love is given.
