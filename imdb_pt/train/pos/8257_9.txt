I just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome rework of a genre widely thought to have pioneered (certainly 'developed' extensively and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, yes, I really think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Perfectly believable, and perhaps even more important, enjoyable performances from Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, who I suspect will see much more in future features. However, I must confess that I enjoyed most of the delightful turn of Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor Mr. Theopolis, essentially playing a lively version of Victor Van Dort Corpse Bride (or, for anyone who has seen the movie, would not do that). who read even better here as the Corpse Pride?) and of course the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his less animated, yet somehow deeply moving, role as the titular character. Just think, he would not have gotten that part were it not for Peter Stormare's Prison Break commitments (as revealed in the question-and-answer session that followed Thursday night). I can not help but speculate that the screenwriters must have taken a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead Zombie 'Bub'. I'm not interested in revealing details of the plot during a Commentary and I will not start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dark, graphically bloody zombie movies that you can trust Romero. On the contrary, it is a movie that will make you laugh constantly and although (and I have to think carefully to be sure) there is a good deal of blood and violence, the delightful humor so highlighted by the surreal environment. created by director Currie and his co-writers, goes a long way toward making it look like a feature that should be rated PG-13. I beg you to go see this little gem Canuck. I will certainly buy the DVD as soon as it appears next summer.
