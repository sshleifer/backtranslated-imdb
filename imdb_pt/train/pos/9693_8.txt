I was very surprised with this movie. I was moved by the lives that paulie played along the way to find her "marie" the girl he was separated from. The mood was also very good and did not hurt the story as I thought it probably would. In fact, I was hoping the "paulie wants a cracker" jokes would damage this movie, but even that was done in a humorous scene that becomes very touching when Paulie is at the research lab press conference. So, if you want to see a good "talking animal" movie, take a look at that movie, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE, in my opinion. PAULIE also has an amazing turnaround in the end which is very well done as well.
