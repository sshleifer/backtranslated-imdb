More or less like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" in a Christmas ward (and one for difficult cases), this rapidly evolving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden as the young husband distracted in the plot principal, is so palpable shipwreck, and with so good reason. His hopeful wife, Loretta Young, is taken to the infirmary at the start of a 20-year prison sentence for abusing a libertine who had probably come to him; Young, as always, does nothing to discourage the sympathy of the public, and she is a little too good to be true, though charming and lovely to see, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with other ward girls make up the heart of the film, and the result - not totally happy - seems right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few perfect movie actresses," in the words of movie historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a new mother unwilling to have twins, reaches Croon " Frankie and Johnny "as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he manages to show more reach than Warners generally allowed him. It is staggered and rhythmically modest, and the panic of Linden's expectant father stays with you for days - this kind of role was often played by laughter, but he is a young man terrified in trouble, and very persuasive.
