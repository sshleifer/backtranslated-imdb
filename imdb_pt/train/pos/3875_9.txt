This film was made by one of Canada's most absurd comedians, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy, but knowing he was a heavy moviegoer, was seen at all local festivals and at the local film library, I had a positive feeling about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was right. Right away, the scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a bit skewed and hard to follow, but, in Pelletier's fashion, it's an unmatched 90-minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> <br /> Allusive loosely inspired and mostly transformed into Dangerous Links (de Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a distorted game of writing notes in the refrigerator. Throughout the movie you will have the opportunity to discover who is who and who is writing to whom in the damn refrigerator ... that appears in an interesting love affair. <br /> <br /> Great storyline, great photography, great quotes from other movies. Should we ask for more for a first movie?
