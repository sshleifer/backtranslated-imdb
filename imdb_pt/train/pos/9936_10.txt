This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcaster decided to broadcast it again a few summers ago, when I just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth at which the organs were explained. Of course, some things are simplified, but most were correct (though it was done 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would suggest that every future medical student should attend. It's a great way to learn some of the basic medical words, for example. Now I'm in my 7th semester and I think I'll watch the series one more time as soon as I buy the DVD box :-)
