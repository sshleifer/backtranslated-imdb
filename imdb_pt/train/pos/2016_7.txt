Higher and Higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's smaller Broadway musicals that had only 84 Broadway appearances in 1940. However, it produced one of his biggest hits, "Never Minded." <br /> <br /> song, so disgustingly rich, the whole Broadway score was dropped when RKO bought the rights to the movie. Instead, a totally new score by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson was written, mostly to accommodate a Francis Albert Sinatra who was making his film debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who has made some vocal appearances in previous films, takes a page from his rival's page singing Bing Crosby. When Bing made his film debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took on the role of Frank Sinatra and I can not think of anyone who could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The Council President is considered the third here behind the stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is the butler and she is the maid of Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid his help for seven months. Mainly because he is about to go belly up in chapter 11, or else he informs the team. <br /> <br /> Errol is an old and delicious soul to work for and none of the staff wants to miss a good thing. They pool their resources and invite Michele Morgan to play Errol's daughter who is in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to grab a rich bankroll in the hope of rescuing the family fortune. Only Michele starts looking at another. <br /> <br /> It's a little plot and certainly not worse than a lot of musicals, but RKO has invested this movie with a good cast of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon make another debutante and their mother, who suspects something is not right, Victor Borge is a fortune that does not count, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes, interpret others the Errol family. employees. Not a bad bunch. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads they all had some kind of commercial success, the music stopped, a great way to spend a night, and I could not sleep at all a bit last night. The latter was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, but lost to Alice Faye's You Never Know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was the year of the musician's Union Strike against the music industry. To release his material, Frank Sinatra recorded the songs of Higher and Higher with a acapella choir for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded songs from his film Dixie the same way for Decca. Both were denounced by union president James C. Petrillo as strike-breakers and both did not cross the picket line again. The strike was not completely resolved until 1944, although Decca had previously broken other record companies and settled before Columbia, RCA Victor and others. The strike provided some anxious moments for Sinatra. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the attack was scheduled. He was closing a necessary spot for his art when he was not sure whether to let Dorsey be a career move. <br /> <br /> Fortunately Superior and Superior was welcomed well a legend was thrown.
