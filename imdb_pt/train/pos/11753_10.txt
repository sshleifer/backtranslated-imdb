hi I'm from Taft California and I like this movie because it shows how we, small people in the city love our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows how important it is that I personally think they should do another but in instead of actors we use children to play the games well show you our determination We have beaten Bakersfield in all games in the last 6 years and since I am a veteran next year is my last chance and then his college we had races back state and I'm next if you want to meet me I'm kyle Taylor and I average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a sick game break into a 75 or around that yard run so check us out on our site and go to our sports bye page
