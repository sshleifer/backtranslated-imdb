14 years since this show was made and still the best show ever made. The writing was 1st class and the production is second to none. This show would never be done today and that's a shame. Hopefully, if you are thinking of finding this program to watch what you do. <br /> <br /> AG came out in the year I dropped out of high school when my favorite TV show was the x-files. It gives you an idea of ​​why I joined this show for the first time. AG was a much better program with better writing, but only one reason? I know this is not the only program to get just one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone shooter (x spin off files) that had good writing and was funny but also only has one season. Does not look right! <br /> <br /> We also have to remember that this show was around before shows like Twilight had done 'cool' shows, so I guess that may have let the show fall. <br /> <br /> Watch this show and enjoy! 10 out of 10 for me.
