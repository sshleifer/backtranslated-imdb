This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. <br /> <br /> Eventually they become spoken, but there is a chance to change anything about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai 1948 and completely free of propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai Family. There is still some weight on the story surrounding the family. The story generally holds weight in Chinese literature and in serious films. <br /> <br /> A young couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife Yuwen live in an old, partially ruined family complex. <br /> <A brilliant contrast is Liyan's young sister, who can not remember the family's past, but accepts everything in a natural way. Her spirit is as brilliant as the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... <br /> <br /> I ended up feeling very sad - but definitely a superior movie.
