This movie has no history. It's just about a bunch of guys who torture an innocent young woman to death. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> It's what they do: they hit her, put her in a hammock and let her hang in like a birdfood, turn her in a chair until she vomit, expose her to loud noise, pour oil boiling on her, putting worms on her wounds, crushing her hand with a sledgehammer, and finally pulling a needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> This film was so realistic that if I did not know it was fake I would have thought it was a snuff film. Although I was disgusted with this movie I really enjoyed it. That scared me. I think it fills some kind of purpose. I give it a 10/10.
