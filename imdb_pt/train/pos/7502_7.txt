Although I really did not feel anything for Lance's character, and I thought his wife could have done a lot better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time developing the character, maybe with Lance - I would have liked it more. <br /> <br /> However, I have to completely agree with DoyleLuver when they said "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character, Ben: 'I am the star here, that's right, I'm the talented ! '"If you watch the movie, just watch it, even when it's in the background ... your facial expressions, everything in the eye, you know for sure what motivates Ben, exactly how he feels about the comments, even which is a quick look behind a character's back. Great acting in a fair movie.
