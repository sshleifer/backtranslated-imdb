It's very bad that a lot of people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! I'll explain it too :) This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "Dream" in a coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now what people have not understood is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. this episode is about his preparation for his death. He loses his own identity and ends up forgetting about himself, so he disconnects all his connections with this world. You'll realize what I'm saying in the doctor's scene, where Tony says he lost his folder containing "his life." The creators really did an excellent job of interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will see that this and the next episode are unique, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> Like every episode of sopranos, the acting and filming are excellent. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was the role of the monks. Anyway, this episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else can get a better view of what happens in a near-death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 without a doubt.
