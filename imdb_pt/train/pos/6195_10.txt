After seeing this movie months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and I feel I should buy it or at least see it again, even though I have watched it at least 3 times when I rented it at that point. <br /> <I fell in love with Hal Hartley's direction many years ago-I discovered that these films could make me laugh in a place that is rarely entertained. It's a strange feeling, granted, and I suppose most people out there do not really understand, or make them feel confused and a bit uncomfortable - I think I really do - it's as if these films were made for me Although I do not remember if I really laughed out loud during this movie, it remains one of the funniest movies I've seen in many years. If you do not see the humor in the grocery bag that Fay carries from the street to a church, to your brother's editor's office, to your son's director's office, you may not have the intelligence to be very impressed with this movie. The bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged as a maternity icon that Parker Posey, usually impetuous and impetuous, must take before the international intrigue of the rest of the film scares her. <br /> <br /> I consider "Henry Fool" my least favorite of the Hartley movies. I honestly do not remember very well - I think the character itself was so contemptible that I found it tedious. Hartley's fort seems to be the development of female characters. <br /> <br /> In addition to Posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. His extravagant ingenuity is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make outrageous banal advice helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film explodes into a highly relevant international intrigue, explaining political situations in Afghanistan. This is never suspect at first. The complexity of the development of this film is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> This is the epitome of a "stand alone" sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more mystery revolves around him, the less he is expected to appear at the end of the movie - as an alcoholic smoking complaining machine, throwing insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him . . It's like discovering Santa Claus, in fact, he's a 12-year-old school bully. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and pleased with Hartley's other recent films, "The Girl from Monday" and "No Such Thing", Fay Grim "goes way beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality that no Oscar winner would ever dare.
