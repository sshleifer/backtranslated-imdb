"Happenstance" is the Parisian movie New Yorker I've seen since "When the Cat's Away" (Chacun cherche son chat). <br /> <br /> A movie last year released to capitalize on Audrey Tatou's attention is winning "Amelie", his French title is more appropriate: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon", as in summing up the theory of chaos as a controlling element in our lives. <br /> <br /> Tatou gamine is less irritating here, because it only occasionally exhibits that gorgeous smile in the midst of its unhappy adventures, and because it is part of a large, multiethnic group, so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters, especially since some of the cute guys and older women looked like me, and some of the characters fantasized about what they should do in such a way that I was not sure if they were doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests, subway cars loaded with cafes. <br /> <br /> The subtitles were very annoying for the two parts of the dialogue. once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
