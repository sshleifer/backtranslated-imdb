The GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all the box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most "drivers" stayed at home watching their new Motorola TVs. Almost every recent box office. Of course, current $ 10 films will dominate. In 1951, it cost $ 90 to $ 60 on Radio City, from 44 to 75C, at Loew's Palace in Washington DC, or from 35 to 50c. What counts is the number of people who respond to the image, not "media squabbles" not adjusted. The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the real life of Enrico Caruso (not really a great story) and played it in the trash. Instead, 90% of the film's focus was on music. Thus, MGM gave us the best live opera singer, MARIO LANZA, making the music of the best historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful film. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career too far. Too fat to play PRINCE OF THE STUDENTS, Edmund Purdom took his place - with the voice of Lanza nicknamed and with Lanza, who before was beautiful and fat, represented in the publicity. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be discouraged by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the film.
