In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the other two Jafar Panahi films I've seen, the director explores surprising amounts of depth on subjects that seem, superficially, light. In hindrance, Panahi's seriomatic tribute to Iranian women defending their rights, I do not think it is so successful. Not that what he's saying is not important, of course (and it's a shame that, like virtually every other Panahi film, the Iranians can not see it). But after a while, the film looks a bit flat and looks long even at 90 minutes. I'm not saying I did not like it. The actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But it's not an important job, in my opinion.
