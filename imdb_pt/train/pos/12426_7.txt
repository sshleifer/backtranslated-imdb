David Duchovney creates a role that he should replicate a bit in Californication - the troubled talent. And it's a role that he plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a good villain and Angelina Jolie pats. The story of a wretched doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted. Drug addiction and the desire of the sensual Jolie mix an intoxicating cocktail. Unfortunately, in the end, the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between the villains and the FBI are confused and rushed as if they were created just to develop the final scene. But, aside, a movie is worth seeing.
