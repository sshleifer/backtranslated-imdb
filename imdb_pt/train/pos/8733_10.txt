When I bought my Toy Story tape when I left for the Video, after being released in theaters, I saw a trailer for that saying from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was going to be a good feature! I was right! The life of an insect like Toy Story is a great story, great characters and lots of animation. My favorite characters are Dim, the Beetle rhino, voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich, the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the Bengal (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich trying to distract the bird and Hemlich as you hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a tasty worm on the toothpick and Slim as if I were going to break! I'm going to bust! I just died laughing at this scene. Being a big bug fan, I think A Bug's life is my favorite Pixar, although I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar movie ever! I do not know how you could hate a Pixar movie! I think they are all good movies! Good job, PIXAR!
