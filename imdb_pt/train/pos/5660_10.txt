I may have seen an episode or 2 when the show aired, but when I watched 1 episode on Netflix I was also addicted. I watched the entire series in 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. First he's completely reprehensible, so you start liking the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His folkloric Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson and finds Satan is great. Enchanting, charismatic, stupid and half dangerous and by "means" I mean "really." I want to be like him when I grow up. Lucas Black is great too. The accents are great too. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows of all time and you owe it to yourself to see it.
