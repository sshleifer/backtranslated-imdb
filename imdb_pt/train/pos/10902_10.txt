I was very moved when I watched the film. How the jonny could keep that hope and faith was incredible. many people only care about what they want and care about all the things they do not have. and they are such small things as chothes, money, a new car. I saw people in tears because of a stain. this movie brings it all back to basics. love, expect the beauty of simple things, but so important in life. This makes our everyday problems seen by what they are Small and really unimportant. you watch this boy and realize, as long as you have been blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you. You are truly blessed. And the saying to stop and smell the roses really does have a new meaning. I know Jonny will see this and I want to thank him very much for sharing that faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you Jonny I know you climb the skies and bring lots of love and laughter to the skies above.
