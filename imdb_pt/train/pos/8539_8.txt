Touching and sad movie. It portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with the paralysis caused by a bicycle accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his married lover, with whom he is often very hostile, and on his interactions with other accident victims, in particular a black and white motorcyclist and supremacist. The film is often humorous, often sad and always believable. Take the box of tissues and watch a cozy Sunday afternoon with your partner.
