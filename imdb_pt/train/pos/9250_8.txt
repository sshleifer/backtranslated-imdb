Clark Gable plays a con artist who enters into the life of Mrs. Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her as she pulls him away with his stiff attitude. Despite their cynicism and cons, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting, he ends up leaving Harlow loyal to the female prison where she discovers she is pregnant. The writing of Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is excellent throughout with many well-designed and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist woman arrested and a black woman president and her preacher father toyed with almost no trace of stereotype). Gable and Harlow show their courage as actors adding nuances and quirks to their characters that take them beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And the direction is much better than you'd expect from Sam Wood. A beautiful shot has Harlow being introduced to the prison, then led to a surprisingly snowy courtyard while the camera trails behind her. This is one of the best of the genres "criminals in love" and "female prison" and has some of the best hard dialogues ever written.
