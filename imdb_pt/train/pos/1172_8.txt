And yet another South Park race comes to an end. This was not as strong an episode as I'd expected, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finisher than the Stanley Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. He still can not handle a candle for Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Homeless is a parody of the zombie genre, done in a way that only South Park would think. of. Instead of meat eating zombies, the entities are homeless that call for change and seem to survive. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the Community Center, although this time on the roof, where they can examine the scene. A particularly funny moment is when a member discovers that his home is gone and becomes homeless, leaving Randy with no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys decided to solve the problem, with the whole story behind the homeless acquisition trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired. South Park is at the best of times when it's being ridiculous. Matt and Trey played safe this week, and did not really criticize the problem of the homeless, just satirized it. <br /> <br /> The moment of shock of the episode comes when a scientist throws himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless. . This is the first time a suicide in South Park goes wrong, and we see the poor man miss his brain and then try to kill himself many times while he dies painfully. Another moment inspired by South Park. <br /> <br /> Overall, the episode was funny, but was kept away from being large, retaining any real comment about the homeless and following directly with the zombie. The ending is a bit funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we must wait until October for the next batch of episodes. It's a long way, but South Park should be applauded for its running. The show seemed to be getting winded last season, but now it's back in top form.
