This movie struck me as a project that had many of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not come together. I do not know who did it, but it does have a slightly Disney feel to it. Although parts of it are unlikely (such as when a pre-adolescent runs for public office) and tends to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normalcy (whatever it is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. The acting is fine. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and his grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a little ... off. It's interesting to see how she has to work hard to maintain a balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player, it was very painful to see Frankie try to stay on a team of boys, but he does a good job at showing the fight he faces. I read somewhere that she is not really a ballerina, but the editing of this movie did a very good job at making it look not just natural but beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not achieve the level of realism we saw during his performances in "Lawn Dogs," "Lost and Delirious," and his small but shocking opposite performance Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense."
