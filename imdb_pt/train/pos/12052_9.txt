I've seen it on TV for so long that I can not remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest and most unnerving movies I've ever seen. There is a fear, both subtle but intense, induced by the black woman lurking at the edge of the frame, not very clearly visible, so that you feel (like the lawyer's hero), uncertain whether it is just imagination or not. It's also one of the few movies that really made me afraid to keep watching. "Production values" are hanged, good films are about the ability of a director to create atmosphere using movies, actors, locations / scenarios, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A real gem.
