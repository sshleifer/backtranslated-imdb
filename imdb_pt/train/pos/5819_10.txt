I have loved this movie since it first came out. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27 years old. I remember playing videogame on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would love to show my son this movie. He likes Michael Jackson too and I know he's going to love this movie just like I did when I was a kid. Even though he is much younger than I when I first saw him. I can not wait to go out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please let it out on DVD !! I'm dying to see again !!! Well, this is my comment, I hope one day soon I will be able to see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
