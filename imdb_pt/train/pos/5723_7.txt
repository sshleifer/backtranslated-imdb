so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I've seen one that really made me jump (or tinker nervously). <br /> <br /> We will definitely get this on DVD when it comes out ... much better than the ring. the thing I do not understand is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then whatever ... I know what I liked and it takes a fair amount for me leave really scared, so I have to say that this is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Now, you may be disappointed with the story if you need everything in a clean and tidy line because the plot goes back a little bit to help build the story (I think was shown in chronological order, would have ruined the whole thing). <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that this movie had very few bloody messes ... maybe the rest of you, studio writers, and what's mediocre, will realize that you do not have to sprinkle the red stuff across the whole scene to make people afraid.
