How amazing this movie is! I've seen this several times over the years and am always fascinated by it. The reason the film is so easy to re-watch is of course the impressive performance given by young Bette Davis. She not only steals every scene she's in, but is much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than in any of the movies she's made so far in her home studio, Warner Brothers. made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and, oh, those lovely big eyes (especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho). Her body was so hunched when she was young. Grab a bag in the cheap robe she wears for her big explosive showdown with Leslie Howard. And boy, she's an absolute power in this scene. Howard is a little too nervous, but he captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee is the sweet young Sally who really loves him. Max Steiner's score is charming and poignant. Splendid performances and flavors of the thirties make this the obligatory version of the classic novel.
