I chose to see this film on the day it was released nationally in France as a personal way of thinking about what happened a year earlier; the collection works as intended: it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, working as an intellectual homage, never relegating to cheap sentimentality or reflective reactionary. <br /> <br /> There have been many claims that the film is anti-American: while I can not speak for all about it, I am an American who found such statements totally false. people make a lot of noise about the Egyptian segment, because Chahine expresses views of Palestinian suicide bombers stating that civilians in a democracy are "just targets" because they elect the governments the bombers are trying to attack, but that ignores a lot in the play: various perspectives are discussed, no one being held as truth, and critics - if they saw the play - seem to forget the warmth and warmth of dialogue between the director and the ghost of American dialogue, and the intense sadness of the director listening to the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Virtually all the films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, in particular the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach and Inarritu. Nair, as usual, tells the true story of an injustice committed against a Muslim family in the wake of anti-Islamist hysteria that swept-and still sweeps-the states. I found Gitai's article a little vulgarly loud and simple in his critique of media hysteria over terrorism, and Penn's article was very impressionistic and elliptical to my liking, though I expected to like it. Borgnine is very good and brave. SPOILER WARNING: A reviewer below mistakenly read the falling towers as a happy moment for the character; My reading is before the fall of the towers is what, because the light floods your room, leads you to the loss of your life that he refused to recognize. again, this is a kind of Impressionist piece, for we know that if the towers were actually blocking the light for this man's apartment, then there would be nothing but smoke and ashes, not light, flooding his window.
