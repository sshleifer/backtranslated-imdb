You can call it a mystery, maybe a little thriller, or a clever movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes you through the life of a person who lost his life and is trying to get it back. <BR> I have to say that I was quite surprised that I really liked this movie. It's usually not the genre that I care about, but the characters quickly became people to me and I wanted to know about what they were and what would happen to them. Like many French films about English made, we are able to learn much more about the character and affection of what surrounds him in his person. This movie is directed by characters and will not disappoint!
