Although I have great respect for the Disney animated films, lately they have not really been what I would call "unmissable". Atlantis seemed intriguing since the first poster and trailer of the movie, and fortunately lived up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more "mature" movie from Disney in the sense that it has no music (a very unusual feature for a movie). Disney movie indeed), and focuses more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offer. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the Earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caves with ruins, and then slowly developing into real ecosystems, which, although usually reminiscent of roughness, become increasingly intriguing until the tropical paradise reached . The presentation of the landscape and scenery of Atlantis simply, without some cheerful and disposable music, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it to the mythology of ancient civilizations in real life, adds to this and works reasonably well. <br /> <br /> In addition, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole jokes, there did not seem to be a "childish" element that I normally associated with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to reach Atlantis and the constant discovery that occurred in Atlantis, for Milo the stranger was able to learn everything he needed to know about the place, helping the Atlanteans to discover parts of his own history . They did not know. Part of this involves the Atlantean "armament," which is used in a very action-packed climax that is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Granted, not the whole story makes complete sense, and the film does not feature new, computer-generated visual effects, but in addition to the Toy Story movies, this is the most fun Disney movie I've seen in years.
