Taking the old collection of stories poses a challenge to the production team, how can this classic character be updated and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring the memories of his previous audience. In my opinion, their mission was fulfilled. A must see for small children, pre-teens, teens and their parents. OK, there are some scary moments that are resolved in no time, but parents with small children should sit up well, the movie moves on to better things. I go with those crafty users who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, and not mellow about it either. Nancy balances her femininity with career-oriented research skills. Much to be fond of here, laughs, do not take yourself too seriously, a true mystery to be solved (one you can discover as additional bonus and friendly characters. Nancy Drew even makes a good movie encounter in my opinion.
