This movie is really cool. Everything seems to come out of the comic book. the scenarios, the costumes and the plot are great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a little better in a dead end, but he still succeeds. Superman is great too. flight effects are OK. but it's a fan film so we can not expect them to be the best. the shot with the superman taking the car was VERY believable. It was cool. This is a movie that I would definitely see if it were real. has everything you'd like in a batman / superman movie. an exception, however, I would throw the joker instead of 2-sided ..... overall I give this movie a 10 because it's a great movie.
