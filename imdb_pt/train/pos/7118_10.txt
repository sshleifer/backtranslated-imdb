This is a great classic movie from the 1940s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield, (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil", '48 and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond), 'Last Rites', '88, fighting the Japanese during WWII being completely surrounded and with only one machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to go home after being injured with a horrible injury, his problems began to begin with his family and girlfriend. Dane Clark gave an excellent supporting role as Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his friend Al to get their life together again. There is never a complete victory for War and we can not forget all the Brave Wounded Military personnel at Veterans Hospitals of All the Wars and our current Iraq Veterans!
