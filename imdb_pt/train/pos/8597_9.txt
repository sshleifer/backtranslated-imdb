I liked this movie. I thought it was a great political thriller about something that has never happened before - a Secret Service agent going awry and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately for Michael Douglas's character, "Pete Garrison," they think HE is the mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady! Since he is doing this, he is unable to take an acceptable polygraph exam and this makes him suspect number one when it is revealed that there is a conspiracy to kill the President. "Garrison" is forced to go forward but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a great job in that role. I do not always care about the people he plays, but he's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is as good (at least here) as the SS chief who chases Douglas until he convinces himself that he is telling the truth. When he does the two work together at the end to find out and then stop, if they can, the plot. Bandits are also interesting, by the way. Also, I will never - and never will - unfortunately see a first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger. This is simply an action movie that entertains the beginning to the end. Are there holes? Clear; probably a number of them, and one reason why you see so many critical comments. However, it is unfairly beaten here. It just is not smart enough for the geniuses here on this site. My advice: relax, go ahead and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, it gets a bit Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment ..... that's what movies are all about.
