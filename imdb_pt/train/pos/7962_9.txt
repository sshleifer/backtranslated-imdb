Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. It crosses this border with flying colors. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw him theatrically at the age of nine and was completely fascinated and enraptured by the film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly invites comparisons with its counterpart in 1963. The previous film is also a fun and entertaining film, but admittedly tends to look more like a documentary about nature than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. Still, I totally recommend the two films. <br /> <br /> This film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sarcastic Himalayan cat, sassy; and the fun young American Bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly cast by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There's practically nothing offensive in the movie. There is a bit of eschatological humor, but nothing extreme. No harsh violence, save a few strained scenes involving a beating waterfall, a furious porcupine, and a dark rail axis. <br /> <br /> Hilarious, scary, moving and above all real, I was surprised to see that this movie did not win any awards, not one. However, I will have to say that this is as good as some of the nominees for Best Picture nowadays.
