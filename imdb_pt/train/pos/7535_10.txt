The 700 Club offers a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as concealed or tacky. I think the program is informative and inspiring. It is natural for many to play mud on a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few shows that can point to a 40 year success story in the world of television media and The 700 Club is one of them. Although Robertson may be wrong in saying that someone should be murdered, I find it curious that so many people will literally stumble into themselves to get into the rush of criticism. I certainly said some silly things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he puts on a great show.
