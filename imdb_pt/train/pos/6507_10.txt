This series, probably produced at the most propitious moment after the events of World War II, is on a scale of value that is far above the presumption of any individual to criticize. The moment of the World at War production in 1974, totaling about three decades after the events of the war, allows a precise account of events in a colorless manner by residual propaganda and inclination. The passage of thirty years allows the account to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures to the field soldiers, civilians and extermination camp survivors. remained to witness the unimaginable inhumanities that civilized humans are capable of. Coming closer or better in their later years, respondents have had ample time to reflect on their experiences and in most cases have had enough time for any propaganda and fervor that may have affected them in the past to have receded, leaving only the memories What they saw and what they did. <br /> <br /> The information that these survivors give, notably reinforced by the postures and expressions they expose in telling their part, give their stories an even greater impact. Names like Ira Eaker, Adolf Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (personal secretary of Hitler) ... the list is too long to relate. <br /> <br /> Today, during the lives of survivors of this enormous lesson of the heinous price of political ambition, are the young men who sing the same kind of militaristic and nationalist warfare that led to World War II. The DVD series we discussed here should include the core of a compulsory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted, but should be taken seriously by those who did not see it at first terrible price hand. <br /> <br /> I'm almost finished watching the set of 11 albums, having seen most of the series when a local TV channel broadcast more than 10 years ago. It has lost none of its pungency to me, in fact it has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest rating possible seems unworthy to be applied to this presentation. . I think the value of this series is beyond counting.
