Maybe some people might consider it a slow movie. However, it is precisely this "slow recording" that allows deeply affecting the viewer. Like that first wonderful scene: first, we can hear the voices; then we can see the characters; finally the camera slowly back and to the side and we see another character, a young man sitting there, apparently neither listening to the conversation or at least not caring. The fact that this young man is the protagonist shows the strategy of the film: to allow the character to develop and be determined by the environment that surrounds him, but without highlighting the points more than necessary. People come and go, come in and out of your life. Although most of the film accompanies him (and most supporting characters are only seen when close to him, defined according to his relationship with him), we are led to believe that we are being objective, so subtle is the director's touch .
