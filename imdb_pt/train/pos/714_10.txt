Even if you're not a huge Ramones fan, Rock 'n' Roll High School is still the biggest rock 'n' roll movie ever made. Because? Because under every camp, he treats with respect the contempt and hatred that teens often feel (and rightly) for the boring, stupid, fascist, established world of adults. This final scene is one of the most glorious and inspiring final scenes from a movie I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen the glory of ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
