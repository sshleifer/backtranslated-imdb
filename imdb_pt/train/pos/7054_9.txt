I thought this movie was so much better than most movie critics are giving credit. Although it has its confusing parts of the plot, this does not interfere very much in its understanding of the film. That said, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then this is probably not the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were great. Each character has its funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival was laughing throughout the event. I thought the satire was a little overdone in a specific area, but this was intentionally done. John Cusack is right in that, although it is set in the future, it really makes you see the present.
