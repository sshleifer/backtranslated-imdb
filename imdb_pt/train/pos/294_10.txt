A critical and financial failure when the first release, critics turned and said that this film is the best of the director. A La Ronde sensation for the film quickly develops when the faces of a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) continue, fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky women and beautiful views in the cinema (Audrey Hepburn). Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was improvised or rewritten the day of filming, which gives the film a sense of joy. Ben Gazzara is excellent as Detective Audrey Hepburn after leaving singer Colleen Camp and seeing taxi driver Patti Hansen on the side. John Ritter follows inept Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has a few chicks he's chasing (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has great performances by a supurb cast. The highlights are Audrey Hepburn (she does not have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspirational choice for a romantic role) and Colleen Camp has one of his best roles as country singer Christy Miller. She is a delight to watch as she shoots her lines in a rat-a-tat-tat delivery. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
