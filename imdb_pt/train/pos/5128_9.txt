First, let me say that I am not from the South, but I am American. I do not love country music, but I can tolerate it. I would never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I do not live in a trailer, but like tuna salad and I have a house. What does this have to do with this comment? So much so if you are one of those people who say that only people "country" love this movie. This film is loosely based on the premise "They love and lose." James Bridges directs a story of American love as real as possible. In an era of Jerry Springer and the "Let's Expose" mentality, this movie sounds truer than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud is "maturing" and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle, so he moves to the big city with them. Bud finds himself attracted to the local world, for the only escape a blue-collar man can afford. He quickly meets Sissy, who is from a similar background and the two have a record romance full of painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (This plot takes so many turns that you just have to sit for a few minutes before they get hooked.) Marriage is a focus here that is often overlooked. At the beginning of the movie they get married and we we see the transition from single to married.The film highlights some of the modern fights a woman has when marrying an old-fashioned man.It also brings to light the male ego with women and competition.) <br /> <br /> Bud is challenged and excited when Micky puts on an electronic bull. Sissy also has ideas for fun, but she is quickly reminded that she is married and must start "acting like one." The emotion between the two characters is crude and expressive and the plot continues from there, especially when they separate and Sissy falls in love with an ex-con with a crush on abuse and cruelty. She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> How can one compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that deserved recognition. He was believable and real. The scene where he shaves his beard and you see him in the bar ... it still gives me shivers. Remember that I'm not a big fan of Travolta, but I see why Sissy was kicking her boots so early in the movie. Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she wrote a note of emotions to Bud after sneaking around to clean his house during the breakup. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn did a first-class performance that made you hate him and curse him by abusing Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, as Buds Mistress / girlfriend was so authentic that great chested girls in the United States prayed to wake up in plain chest to wear the clothes she wore in the film. My biggest compliments go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They looked like somebody's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and no matter how small their role, they made the film much bigger and more natural. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt stood outside after the death of one of the characters. The dialogue between them is moving. <br /> <br /> If you can see it as it is, a true American love story. So I recommend that you accept what it is ... a movie ahead of time that has given us voyeurism in a world different from ours, but real enough for our pleasure and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours then you will like it a lot more. Lastly, music, however, is the date you send back in time if you are over 30 years old.
