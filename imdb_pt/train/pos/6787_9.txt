I stumbled on it last night at TCM. <br /> <br /> I had not seen it since it originally came out, but I had never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> I had completely forgotten how beautiful and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, very good for Shelly Winters before she said goodbye. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman, however, was the state actor par excellence of his day - I had read Othello in high school English - and hated it. After seeing "A Double Life" I read it again and finally understood what the piece was. The team of Gordon / Kanin writers was at its peak when this script was made - <br /> <br /> A film is worth remembering and re-recording,
