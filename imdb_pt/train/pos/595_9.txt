When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story, he built a complete Alamo in the city of Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and is quite the tourist attraction. Meanwhile, we will have a set for future Alamo screen interpretations. One of those with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was made this century. <br /> <br /> But I would say that the Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best story of the filmed Alamo I've ever seen. John Wayne's movie is good if it's exaggerated, but it's a John Wayne movie with the story redone to fill the parameters of John Wayne's screen character. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a good interpretation of the frontier character he was. <br /> <br /> It's much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on The Alamo than Wayne's movie and after reading the book's years. back I can attest to this. Tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but Tinkle was alive at the time that Wayne's movie was made and he was not satisfied with the result. <br /> Alec Baldwin was at the right age for young people. William Barrett Travis, the idealist freedom fighter who, incidentally, owned slaves. Back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. One thing that was not explored and it was not Travis's hyperactive sex drive. He was the Casanova of the Southwest, he still kept a lascivious diary of his libidinal achievements. <br /> <br /> But the man who always takes the lime is Jim Bowie, played here by James Arness. He was a hero in the Alamo, of course, but his career before the Alamo was that of a scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, a crook everywhere selling land that he had a questionable title. But his heroic death certainly redeemed him. No clue to this is in Arness's portrait or any other I have seen of Bowie on the screen. And of course he designed the Bowie knife, made to your specifications. This man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main asset that The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory has is a full-length portrait of Antonio De LÃ³pez De Santa Anna, the president of Mexico who appears to personally drown the rebellion provoked by the Americans who came to settle in Texas at the Mexican invitation. Unfortunately, these Americans came up with some preconceived notions of freedom that simply had not come so far south, at least freedom for whites. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also a scoundrel, but it was the best that Mexico produced until a genuine reformer named Benito Juarez appeared. <br /> <br /> This movie was the farewell performance of Lorne Greene, who briefly appears as General Sam Houston. Greene is not quite my conception of Houston, he really was too old for the role, Houston was in his early forties in 1836, still not the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him, Greene does a good job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic tale of the Alamo tale, check out John Wayne's version, but for historical content I recommend this movie.
