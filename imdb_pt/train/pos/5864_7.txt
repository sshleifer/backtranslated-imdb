I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite movie from the Vietnam War is The Deer Hunter. The deer hunter concentrated on a part of the war and then focused on the lives before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is very loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The story is never developed to the point where the public can really understand and feel the characters like Deerhunter. The flashbacks of Vietnam are not as enveloping as the Deerhunter. That's why I can only give this film 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the acting was excellent. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They immersed themselves completely in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in combat. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the guilt he has in Bobby losing his life trying to save his own. <br /> <br /> I also like the supporting cast. Everyone in town is part of the movie. The city obviously can not handle the veterans of Vietnam very well. Like many small towns, it's all about being quiet, humble and taking care of business. Harris's character, however, can not be any of these things. It's interesting how wars affect people. Some people recover quickly, while others never recover.
