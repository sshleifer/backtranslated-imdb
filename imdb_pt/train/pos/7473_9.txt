Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuances. Helped by the retrospective, Crowe's script is much more rigorous and more detailed than the original of Amenabar. The Spanish filmmaker must have the credit to think first in the story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved just a little. Note that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by "polished".
