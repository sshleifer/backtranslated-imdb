"El Mar", directed by Catalan director Agusti Villarona, and based on the novel by Blai Bonet, offers a glimpse of Spanish history, as seen by an author from the Balearic Islands that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country. The film focuses on three friends and accompanies them from those early days during the war in Majorca until a few years later when two of these friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium, lost in the countryside. <BR> We find for the first time three boys who are playing happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them points to the cruelty of one who commits evil. The boys excluded a young girl, about her age, from participating in her games. <br /> <br /> When we meet the adult Ramallo again, he is on his way to a sanitarium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his childhood friends, is also being treated, and the young woman who was not welcome to participate in her games is now one of the nuns who oversee her health care. It is obvious that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that only means that he is in love with the tough bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a good job of portraying the older Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur, vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sister Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, makes an appearance as Carmen, the wife of the caretaker of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows Agusti Villarona's talent in making the novel come to life for the viewer.
