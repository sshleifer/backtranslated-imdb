As drunk playboy millionaire Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult man stuck in childhood. As it turned out, the role fit so well on Moore, who held him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including the pale continuation of this film), but this does not diminish the charm or appeal of this image, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are unstable, but the cast is so delighted that it's a hard-to-resist movie. He has a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Gielgud a malicious and drily entertaining role as Arthur's servant, Hobson; Their relationship with Arthur is delightful and they have a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love interest) is daring in a discreet and Moore is bold but skilled and lively; he never got rid of Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document from a high point of his career to value. *** in ****
