Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his companions perform a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn. Their comrades are killed instantly, but it seems they are indeed the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a mass constantly dripping from humanoid pulp; when he turns into a savage killer, melting at every step of the way, he is traced by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> This is so funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that laughter is all unintentional. It seems to me kind of a joke with the low budget genre efforts of the 50s and 60s and as such is a wonderfully entertaining film. This sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We're even treated to a split screen sequence that really does not add anything, but it's still a gas to watch. <br /> <br /> Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for having this ingenious idea; his ultra-slippery character is truly memorable. I think his rhythm is a bit wrong; some scenes (like the old couple's) take a while, but ultimately he offers solid, schlocky, and B-movie products with a measure of pride. The climax is especially fun. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is fun (but also amusingly silly for a few moments), and the cinematography of Willy Curtis creates some really great scenes sometimes. This brings me to the fantastic and convincing makeup effects of Rick Bakers, who form a highly respected centerpiece for the film, right down to the finale. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under heavy makeup for almost the entire film. (Sachs also gets rave reviews for having the movie cast on the floor) and does what he has to do well enough. DeBenning becomes a somewhat despicable and foolish hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as hot as her wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are well in support. It's also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (doing a nice photo of topless), Janus Blythe (from "Eaten Alive" by Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes" by Wes Cravens), and even director Jonathan Demme in part a little. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining midnight movie with blood, chills and enough laughs to classify it as worthy of recognition for the horror / science fiction lovers of low quality everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
