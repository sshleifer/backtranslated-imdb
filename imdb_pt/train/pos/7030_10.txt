We recorded this when it aired on TV in 1995 and we look forward to all those years for its release as it quickly became a favorite with our family. The children are now teenagers and must have seen him a lot of zillions of times, but they still watch him religiously with friends. Its timeless appeal reaches all age groups - similar to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander delicious and wonderfully light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this site are quite rude to him, but our family gives him top ratings. (We love his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) provides us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just stole the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was Chynna Philip's performance in Kim. Part of this has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating this, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable, and simply awful. The director should have seen it and corrected it. Or never forward it to start. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, the picture is delicious and I would recommend it for families of all ages.
