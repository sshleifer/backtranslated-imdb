No doubt Beat Street is the best movie about the breakin scene. Everything about it is local, the clothes (puma), the music and most importantly the dance! The plot is basic, but hey what's there to tell a story? The purpose of the film is to show what the children did at that moment, what mattered to them. This shows that teens are generally good, all that mattered to these ordinary kids was music, dance, and friendship. Having watched the DVD recently, I was amazed at how well it stood the test of time! The clothes did not look dated (possibly because Puma is now having a huge comeback), the music still sounds fresh, and the dance is still captivating to watch. A film that anyone between 10 and 25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture.
