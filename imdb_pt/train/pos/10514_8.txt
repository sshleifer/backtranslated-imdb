Emma is a terribly flawed movie based on Jane Austens' classic novel. I did not read the book, so I did not really know much about the plot, and yet I foresaw almost the whole plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of poor writing or direction. The movie is, for some reason, very fun and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I did not like, but most were well-acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film is also starring Toni Collette (which has it all but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who has also been better, but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming (I've never been impressed and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam (The performance of who is a bit wood at first glance, but actually quite subtle, even if it was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is still a lot of fun and it's worth watching.
