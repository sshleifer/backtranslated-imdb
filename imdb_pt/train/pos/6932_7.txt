WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with recovering his precious possession, a repeating rifle made by Winchester. The rifle keeps changing hands, and Stewart stubbornly remains behind him. This 1950s B & W effort by Anthony Mann is more of a crime movie than a traditional Western, and cowboys often look more like modern gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is going to a ranch with a man (Charles Drake), she can get married. She ends up falling in love with Stewart, but not before spending a little. Winters is the most complex character in a movie full of unusual characters. Keep an eye on young Dan Dureyea like crazy and Tony Curtis in a small role. A little clumsy Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
