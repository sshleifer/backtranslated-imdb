A famous maestro decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There he comes in Dutch with the local church choir that will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to watch foreign films that are not English, and I've seen some Swedish films in my life, but that was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? In my opinion, this movie is a gem, thanks to many things, of which one is exceptional acting. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful and almost timid and dedicated conductor Daniel Daréus. Beautiful Frida Hallgren is charming with her beautiful smile and subtle acting. The members of the choir are all well-developed and interesting characters with their own stories. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who dedicated his life to music and tries to create a quiet existence in the village where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been until then. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are the creators of outstanding films. Go see Så som i himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and it's also comforting in some way.
