A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. He has that endless and pretense clich√©, but most TV movies have it anyway. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as being an ex-con / drifter. The marriage between her and the woman he works for, I find a bit odd, but, I think by the time it's set, it's believable, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the 'tv' version edited, even though the movie has been made and shown on 'tv', I find that a bit awkward too. But, I feel that if I saw the whole piece, I would most likely give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still ... a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
