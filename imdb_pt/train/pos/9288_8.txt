I found this a surprisingly light touch in a 1950s culture film. John Wayne would hardly be his first choice as a cultural addict, being as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bullfight at Harrods. But this time he was left to play a role that was much more passive than his usual bluff personality, and he fulfilled his task with style. The duke was a guy who really could do well. Your facial expressions and body language can be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to master this film. Many of his good intentions have come. He had authority over anyone, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian. <br /> <br /> The history of American attempts to conquer an isolationist Japan was more of a political intrigue than buck-fights or hell-hounds for leather. I can not comment on the accuracy of his research, but the strangeness of the Eastern culture in relation to Western sensibilities was well demonstrated. There were a lot of minutely choreographed ceremonies, involving what looked like this observer, like costumes and authentic props. The scenarios were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought were applied to him. <br /> <br /> The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added one more element and prevented the film from becoming a political effort or a waving flag. Script was good without being too wordy. There were a lot of Japanese dialogues, but the long periods of translation did not interfere with the narrative. It was good to see many genuine Orientals on the set. Whether they were Japanese or not, I can not say. But anyway they looked like the paper. At least the clues were not interpreted by Caucasian transvestites, unlike other efforts like "Blood Alley" (yes, I know they were Chinese) "The Inn of Sixth Happiness" or even "The King and I." Frankly, I liked it more than any of those other movies. The script was better to begin with. I never liked the songs of 'The King And I', and I was not impressed by the heavy anti-Communist subtext of 'Blood Alley'. I confess I have never seen this work before and found it compares very favorably to many of the Duke's most popular rides. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
