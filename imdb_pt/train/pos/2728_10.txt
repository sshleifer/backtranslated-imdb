Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks's adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Impressive black-and-white cinematography (which should have won an Oscar), a scary score by Quincy Jones and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the strangely compatible killers. This movie went from 0 to 4 at the Oscars and was not even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle went. Who knows! <br /> <br /> Although you do not know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the process of tormenting these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There simply are no flaws in this. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second place. Highly recommended!
