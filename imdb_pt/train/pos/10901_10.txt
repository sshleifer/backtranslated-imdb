This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is an afterlife and never give up on reaching people and spreading their love. Watching minutes of his long fight life was from breaking the heart. Listening to her clever comments and seeing her lovely gestures was comforting. And to see him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been touched by this little giant. Please, if you get the chance to watch this movie - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
