Although I love this movie, I can hardly watch it, it's so real. So I put it on tonight and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered vividly, but I just wanted to see if I could find something I had not seen before ... I did not: it's because it's very real to me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that! It is absolutely obvious that most of these people who have commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other films in which Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman appeared later. I will be so blatantly frank: I am 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, you will be aware that I was a professional female mimic for 60 of those years, and also appeared in movies - you would never recognize me even if you were familiar with my nightclub persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this movie? YOU BET I DO !! .... <br /> <br /> ... and I'm not at all embarrassed. If you have not come across some of them, it is your loss - but, there is a great chance you have but just did not know it. So many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters may surprise you. There should be no secret. MANY actors / actresses emerged behind the scenes of "Midnight Cowboy." Who is to judge? I can cite several current BIG-TIME stars that were created on the decadent streets of many cities, and were not at all hampered by the time they spent there. I do not make any judgment, because these are human just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter how the package looks like. The "trivia" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could play the role of "Ratzo" is a gem - he can be seen driving his car all over Los Angeles - how do you think does he receive his contribution? ? I can also name many male stars who stayed on the streets and crossed the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legitimate, I can also cite some HUGE stars that had to be constantly expelled from our streets, trying to make a choice. <br /> <br /> This should not be a surprise today, although it is definitely an action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They have no less sweet smell because they are of a different hue. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" thought that "Joe Buck" had been molested by his grandmother. Although I saw you in your bed with a boyfriend, I did not find any incidence of it. Believe it or not, kids have not always had their own rooms - because that's a must today should tell you something kinky may be going on in the master bedroom. Whose company? Hoffman may have been begging for change on the streets, but some of the "users" point out that Jon Voight was not a big star for the filming of "Midnight Cowboy" - his real salary would surprise him. I think it was stolen! No one can doubt the clarity that he put in his paper, nor that it made him a star for a work as good as "Deliverance". He defined a powerful man who conquered his demons and was the best: few people commented that he had been sodomized in this film. The late 1960s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been fun. <br /> <br /> I also did not find homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they were clearly opposite, unattractive to each other. They found a much higher relationship - true friendship. If you did not understand this at the end of the movie then you wasted your time. The perplexity of "Joe", but the shameless devotion was evident. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for that role - one that John Wayne could never do, and he was so handsome in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne received his Oscar. Each character in this movie has been beautifully set - if you do not think they're still out there, you're mistaken. "The party" ? - Participate in some of the "raves" that young people attend ... if you can enter. Look for people trying to get into hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of the elegant women of society who have to get to the heart of the matter at times. If you were shocked by your brilliant acting, thinking "this is not real", look at the "ladies" of today who live on the verge of discredit ... and are admired for it. <br /> <br /> "Joe" brutality displayed in stealing the old guy, unfortunately, is also part of life. You do not have to tolerate it, but it's not much different from any violence. "Joe" explicitly pointed out his purpose - in this situation, I would have delivered the money faster than he asked. This is one of the scenes that makes this movie a movie that I do not watch. I'm heartbroken by both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this squalor to direct this chilling and beautiful eye opener - Waldo Salt did not write about clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part of doing it on the screen must have realized that he was making history and should be proud of her honesty. Perhaps "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not pity to present it to the public. Not looking does not mean it's not there - give me the truth every time. Angry! for all......
