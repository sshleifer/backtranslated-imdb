First, I want to clarify that the average user's inability to appreciate the imagination is terrifying. What makes this program so unique is the hyper-reality that it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute. Where was the wonder of the eccentric tales of childhood, as well as A Wrinkle in Time. <br /> <br /> I say it's refreshingly original because it's a polar opposite to the masses of television lay-it-all-out <br /> <br /> It's good to add a bit of escapism to the television experience. <br /> <br /> Hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the program. The scenario of the 1950s, the innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and physical environment that should not be taken as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. . Although entertaining, other television programs took a bottom shelf for this series. It really restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder to the television. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly reached the top of my list.
