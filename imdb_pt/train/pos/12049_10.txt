I gave this movie a 10/10 with some reluctance, as it's hard to praise something so haunted and terrified for years. The pure threat of the woman in the face of black is only pure horror and the music that accompanies it only worsens the fear. <br /> <br /> I saw it when it was the first time on TV when I was 10 and it really bothered me for years. I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said that too. Many movie reviews talk about how disturbing or terrifying a movie may be, but you can believe everyone who posted in this forum is incredibly powerful. I mean, I really like horror movies and I usually find them pretty funny most of the time, but that's really menacing and will probably upset most people. I have not seen it since I was 10 and I'm tempted to watch it again, but I fear I may have a few sleepless nights. I can not define exactly what it is exactly, but I think it has to do with the fact that fear is Woman's greatest weapon and that we as spectators are as susceptible as we feel fear so intensely. It is remarkable that the feelings of other onlookers are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw the play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can be compared to that.
