"Dangerous Offender" is the story of an apparently anti-social girl, and how she managed it. It's based on a true story, and although I was irritated by the description of a grumpy, stark, main character, and the hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer, I am forced to accept that life imitates art. and that there are people out there like that. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds, for me, because although there is a bit of softening the behavior of the title character until almost the end, one is gradually led to sympathy for her. , as the film shows how it has reached its present state - which proves to be self-destructive, rather than antisocial. <br /> <br /> Truly a poignant movie that will bring a lump in your throat when you think about it - which will be many times. <br /> <br /> Despite its many flaws, (including that it is difficult to watch, sometimes because of bodily functions and suicide attempts) this is another production that I am proud to call Canadian.
