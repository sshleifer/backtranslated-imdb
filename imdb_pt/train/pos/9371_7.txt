One thing I've always liked about Robert Ludlum's thrillers is just when you think you've figured out, going in a completely different direction. There are so many twists in this movie that I have a sore neck to watch. <br /> <br /> One thing I also love about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be depended on driving and in that case writing (with his brother Rick) a good story . <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that they have all perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and this will keep him interested, and guessing, until the end.
