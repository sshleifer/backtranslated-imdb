This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and now I'm addicted! Ok, so it requires a different mindset to watch US movies, but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is, you will not be disappointed. The songs are superb, melodic and very captivating. The actors are visually appealing, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses in the film world. Places, color are spellbinding. If you want something different and want to be high, stimulated and stimulated, I recommend you watch this movie.
