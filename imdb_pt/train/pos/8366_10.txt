From the beginning I knew it would be the best experience of watching movies of my life. The idea of ​​two giant robots, manned by brilliant humans, fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought out of the plot I've ever experienced. I can not even begin to describe the brilliant acting and the well-written script. Let's just say it compares to both Lord of the Rings images combined. The Academy had a grave carelessness in not celebrating the joy that is ..... ROBOT JOX.
