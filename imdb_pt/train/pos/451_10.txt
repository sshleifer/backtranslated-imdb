If someone is wondering why no one does movies like they used to do, with conversations, characters and a simple friendship theme struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, these people need to watch this movie and see top notch writing, directing and acting that melts into a wonderful night of observation about how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, sometimes channeled into a fantastic entertainment comedy made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead roles. Under the direction of Mike Newell's brush, these actors perform memorable performances that are photographed with a subtly subtle painter's eye. Reminiscent of the turn-of-the-century theatrical farce, this film can be called a friendship farce, which becomes a valuable experience in the growth of romantic nature within each character, and also in the viewer. An artistic telegram about the importance of caring about those around us.
