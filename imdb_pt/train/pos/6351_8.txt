When the Grinch left I was excited though I thought it would be a lucky movie and it was. Although you had a little nightmare before Christmas, touch it. You know it's kind of dark and scary. I loved this movie because it helped to fill people with the Christmas spirit. So mostly the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened then well in Whoville they say that the little heart of the Grinch grew three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
