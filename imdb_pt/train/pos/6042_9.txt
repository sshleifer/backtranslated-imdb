Running out of movies to rent, I got Freebird. I fought through the first third of the movie asking if the rest would be a waste to see. Fortunately, it really warmed up, and I loved the movie a little bit. The second half of the movie made me smile and laugh all the time. Fortunately, although there were chunks of CGI included, they were not overblown or overbearing. <br /> <br /> I would have to say though - all actors have strong European accents, so be warned if you have a hard time understanding those voices or your cultural mood. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie, and I'll have to ask for a copy for my own collection.
