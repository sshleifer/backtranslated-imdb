In the old commercial of empty audio cassettes, the slogan "Is it real or is Memorex?" The same can be said for the events of this episode - a compilation and remix of "The Cage," the first Star Trek pilot. Mr. Spock deftly commanded the ship to take him to the forbidden planet Talos IV, in order to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain to be burned and paralyzed, to return there. Why the finagling? Because having any contact with Talos IV invites a death sentence. Why this is so is never explained - this bothered me tremendously - but if nothing else, it contributes to the story. After he got the ship to travel to Talos IV, Spock surrendered to Dr. McCoy (the oldest officer present; Captain Kirk was off the ship) to the prison and said: "The prosecution is riot, Dr I never received orders to take over the ship. " What follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the Talosians - we learned why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for Captain Pike to reach Talos IV, even at the risk of Mr. Spock's death. The illusions that the Talosians create, the background music and the whole plot are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as the Guardian (the Talosian chief) is wonderful. Call me sexist, but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role, but she was perfect! The Talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can not really tell if they are male or female and this does not really matter. This episode, more than any other in the series, makes me wait and pray that there are other worlds out there and that there are such advanced civilizations! How cool would that be! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. Meg Wyllie looks like an alien and I do not mean it with evil.
