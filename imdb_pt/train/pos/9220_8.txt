A delightfully unassuming send off from Romeo and Juliet. Approach yourself with no expectations besides having a good time and you will enjoy this. A talented group of comic actors got loose and had a riot in this vehicle of carefree artists. The bad reviews were due to a snobbery about Shakespeare's treatments. Some people think every movie should be "important" --- If you share those views, do not bother. The credits say "present" Angelina Jolie, which is not even close to being true, but she is incredibly beautiful as the character of Juliet and, as always, her acting is wonderful - and considering her age at the time, even her dialect it's very good. Re-creating this classic tale with rival Italian families in the catering business in New York results in great fun. See it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud.
