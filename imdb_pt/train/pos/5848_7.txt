And I gave a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it is very well balanced. At a time when there were so many other shows that were tied to toys / games, this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. As others have said here, he was ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately that's why the show was condemned. They have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope more people leave. <br /> <br /> How does this compare watching now 20 years after it first came out .. I do not know I still like despite the sometimes awkward animation, and that IMHO is the only flaw. The writing was almost top of the line and way ahead of the competition ........ I hope for more DVDs or even a set of all episodes in the correct order ... The DVDs are good, but I do not think the stories are in the right order, but despite that, the show rocked.
