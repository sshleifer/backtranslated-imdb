Nothing is more pleasing to me than a tale of who-guesses or suspense, which keeps you guessing how the whole thing will end. And that is precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling piece by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). And in this, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE start doing the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier came out of SLEUTH - with the same level of skill and puzzle that never existed in that extraordinarily clever game. <br /> <br /> But because it's to scare you, surprise you and keep you guessing. As for the result, it's hard to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know at the beginning is all you need to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose last play failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer, CHRISTOPHER REEVE, sends him the manuscript of his play, Caine realizes that his approval would solve all his problems and restore his reputation. <br /> <br /> From that point on, it's a matter of fun and games for the public, as Ira Levin's story unfolds, managing to overcome Agatha Christie for the number of twists. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play with each other brilliantly, each bringing some dynamic tension to the audience. tale, as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that combines drama with humor. <br /> <br /> In short: Worth seeing - but not everyone is satisfied with the ending.
