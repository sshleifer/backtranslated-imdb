I am shocked by the negative comments I read and can only assume that the people who made such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and real portrait of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. It was well done to the point of sometimes forgetting that I was watching a movie. This brought Joseph's life of suffering, optimism of good nature, lasting faith in people and in God, and supreme sacrifice to life in such a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in reverence. If anyone of any Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in any positive way - I would have to say that it is a reflection of the individual and NOT of the film. I give the film a "10" and I encourage sincere souls to see it. At the very least, it is an extremely sensitive portrait of the man who gave everything he had to what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film remains as a lasting reminder of the kind of people we should assume. to be- no matter what religious beliefs we hold.- Ann Pruitt-
