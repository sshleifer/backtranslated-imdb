The costumes and makeup were great, there were some exceptionally funny lines and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as good a job as could be done given the script writing rather disappointing. Of course this was mostly a kid's movie, but if you're going to spend so much money making a movie, you should at least give the story enough to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. Worth seeing, but does not have the qualities needed to become a great classic by any measure.
