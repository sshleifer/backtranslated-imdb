I never realized that Charles Boyer, (Luis Denard) appeared with Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together. Even Peter Lorre, (Contreras) played a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that made him faint. This story deals with a Republican Courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will do great damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard by catching him and at the same time falling in love with him and then helping escape an angry mob of English miners who threaten his life. The real villain in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers", which gives an excellent performance. Great classic movie from 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
