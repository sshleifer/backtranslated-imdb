I'm stunt double, I must admit I've never seen a movie with such a good story and no high-stop martial art combat scene of special effect. If you like the fantastic genre, like me, you will certainly be more than satisfied! All characters have a very cool power and the special effect is close to perfection, in one word, flawless! I'm going to listen to this movie a lot in the next few years.
