Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This luxuriant and worthless saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all the elements of Sirk's soaps and placing them strategically in a single film. "Written on the Wind" very obviously influenced the 1980 TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", since it's basically a feature-length version of the late night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, beautifully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York secretary who marries oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also passionate about the quiet but sexy secretary. They all return to the Kyle family mansion in Texas, where we meet their white-bitch, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar winner). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from novels to cat fights, this is an exaggerated journey. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone since she can not have a true love that is Mitch. Ending all this, Kyle discovers that he is impotent, but Lucy somehow ends up pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How could you not love it? This film signals one of the most popular films of Universal and one of the best works of director Sirk. Some of the dialogues are absolutely scorching and visual metaphors are played in every way - the wind theme is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underutilized, despite having received the highest billing behind Hudson. The loss of Stack's Oscar would have devastated him. He considered this his best performance and apparently did not like to lose much. And he got a fabulous performance like the whining alcoholic. What a gorgeous movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for a long time - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's your Oscar? <br /> <br />
