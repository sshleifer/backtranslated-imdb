I saw this show when I was a kid and I loved the details and I never forgot it. I finally bought the DVD collection and it is exactly as I remembered it. This is how a dock should be impartial and factual. The film is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series that I found equal to this is 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. <br /> <br /> I just wanted Hollywood to sit and watch the show, so they could do some great war movies. <Br/> Note. Band of Brothers, Rescue Ryan Soldier, Iwo Jima Letters, Our Parents' Flags and When Fade Trumpets are some I would recommend
