Red Eye is not the kind of movie that will win Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, and his brand is a good indication of what a viewer can expect. The fact that Red Eye is a small, undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of Craven's work in producing a lightweight but generally enjoyable box office. In fact, it's the perfect kind of movie to show off as fun on board, paying attention without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer. <br /> <br /> In general, there is an extravagant feeling for the plot, vague subplot and terrorist. motivation and supporting characters, and the main section has a TV movie feel. However, there are definite elements of Schumacher's hitchcockian suspense and echoes of Phone Booth, which is ultimately a more sophisticated (and pretentious) game about the same idea of ​​emotional crisis being repressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses mainly on two people seated in airplane seats, he lives or dies on the characters and script. Filled but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams are the main reasons why the film is loaded. Not only by doing the zing dialogue but also by giving some sort of Adam's Rib-type dimension to his battle of 'male logic' versus female 'sensibility'. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the movie Craven gives himself a little. Scream style as man-chase-girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what looks like Brian Cox after the 'Just for Men' treatment, his appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers, The Ring and making him the sexegenarian version of Jude Law. Short distance fun.
