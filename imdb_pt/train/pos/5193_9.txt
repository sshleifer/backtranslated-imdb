The sword fight was out of this world, the fights are spectacular without the wire flying techniques (until the end) that are very common nowadays. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the film. The characters in the attack on the bandits' mansion were clich√©s, but the film is comfortable with that. An injection of Woo's mood. <br /> <br /> The plot with its twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you could not tell who was good or bad or which side people were on. <br /> <br /> A good sense of suspense and well-timed surprises. The depth of the story is intense enough for a fickle film of that genre to come to you in the way that most kung-fu movies do not.
