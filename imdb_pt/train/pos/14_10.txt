This movie has a special place in my heart, like when I first got it, I was teaching adult literacy. That sounded very true to me and even to an exceptional student that I had at the time. There are scenes that make you swallow with a sudden emotion, and those that even put a smile on your face through the identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Excellent presentations by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that stand out with the best work, a great turn of the young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story and an astonishing soundtrack make the experience more enjoyable and rewarding. .
