Reed Hadley makes a better Don Diego than a bold and daring Zorro, but this is almost irrelevant, because this series features the best theme song of any series, and the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous stagecoach. feat. There are other good stunts and lots of action, plus many chilling chapter submissions, but if for no other reason, you should see this movie to watch the stagecoach stunt, and then watch it again in slow motion. It's incredible, and despite the lower budget for this chapter, Yak makes the scene better than in the most celebrated film "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart: this is the real deal!
