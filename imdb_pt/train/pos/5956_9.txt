Yes, this is a very low budget movie. So the acting is not rewarded and sometimes the action is slow because the filmmakers are filming longer sequences and not a million instants that are later edited in a movie. This movie makes up for it with an excellent script that takes vampirism seriously, explains and develops a complete plan with it. In addition to the vampire story, we get detailed information on genetics, law and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical reflections and some good metal music. Many compliments go to Dylan O'Leary, the director / writer / lead actor. It is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well. I think to enjoy this movie, you have to be well versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows about all of these things. There is also great camera work, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack - something I have not seen before but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack on Fulci's Zombie. The cast is good, as the sexy woman is sexy indeed. The main vampire also seems perfect for the role. The female victim seems vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low-budget film, there should be more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I look forward to seeing Mr. O'Leary's future projects.
