Old Jane's educated tale seems very popular these days. I lost count of the number of versions out there. Probably the reason is that their "grooves" are our "grooves," even at this late date. This mini-TV series gives a proper way to tell the novel. Emma, ​​stubborn and stubborn, is a "modern" girl when you think about it, although Jane Austen's world environment may seem somewhat artificial to us today. If you do not look like EMMA, I'm just going to say that Emma is self-sufficient to get the punishment. Worth watching to find out how. The acting honors here go to women: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have a psychic connection with old Jane!
