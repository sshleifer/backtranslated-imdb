"Heartland" is a wonderful representation of what it was like to actually live on the border. The hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of climate and the lack of medical care are mixed with the camaraderie and interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also good to see the west inhabited by real people. Nobody was glamorous or it looked like he'd just been through a session with the make-up or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is simply wonderful. She is an example of the strong and persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and left no difficulties in their new life in a new land.
