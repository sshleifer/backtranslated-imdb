One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. And the next day we were at the grocery store on Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and me, and guess who was coming our way! Barney Phillips, but no hat - at least, I do not think he was wearing his hat. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye, and he said something as he left it at home, and everyone he met that day asked him about it. <br /> <br /> A friendly guy. We used to see all sorts of character actors in LA in those days. <br /> <br /> BTW, I was a teenager and it took me a long time to get over the other three's "three hands"! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood native and resident from 1947 to 1963.
