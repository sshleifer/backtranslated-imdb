I love this movie It's a definite inspirational film. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rent or worth buying. Must be in everyone's house. Best movie I've seen in a long time. This will drive you crazy because everyone is so cruel to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of funny lines to keep you connected. I love many of the quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on the job of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never realize it's as long as it is. I get so caught up in it, it 's so fast. I love this movie. I watch whenever I can.
