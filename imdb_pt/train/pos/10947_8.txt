The Sarah Silverman program is very much like Sarah's own; It is so exaggerated with prejudice that you can not take it seriously. The fact is that while most people "understand", this does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can give it up. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because all the episodes so far have been as good as the last. <br /> <br /> Like all the shows though, it's not perfect. Personally I love the program, but there are some huge flaws with it. Racist songs are funny, but they age much faster than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I had with "Jesus is magical" too. It seems that Silverman has been given a quota of songs per episode that does not have to exist. Not to mention that while the lyrics of the songs she writes are good, the song, well, it's not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that meanwhile for some reason the program will attract the fans. of Monty Python, Vertical Citizens Brigade, etc., is nothing like these shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as much as I enjoy this program, I can not watch more than the half hour limit at a time. It stays flat too fast. The repeat value for this show is low too - the second time around an episode is pretty funny, and for the third time, in my opinion, it's annoying. <br /> <br /> Still, the first time is very, very funny. Take a chance.
