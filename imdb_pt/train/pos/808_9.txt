I just wish that Return of the Jedi was directed by someone else, that is, there are too many ewok scenes, completely unnecessary. In addition, our heroes seem different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke seems annoying, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda simply dies. <br /> <br /> But there are many extraordinary things. In this episode I just can not hate you. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The Emperor (now that it is evil) 4- The Speeders chase the forest endor. 5-The last battle. 6-The scene of seduction on the black side. 7-Anakin's return to the good side of strength. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes had been cut and another director was hired, that would have been as perfect as Episodes 4 and 5, but it's still extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
