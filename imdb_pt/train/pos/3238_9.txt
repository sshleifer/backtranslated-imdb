The Finnish version of "Short Cuts" by Robert Altman, set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, disappointment and disappointment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to provoke a romance for her co-workers: she radiates an enormous joy of love and life. The other episode appears and the old man dies in a hospital and his wife tries to help him to die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight the humiliating practices of the hospital and their solitude contrasted with the "routines" of the hospital staff (despite signs of occasional empathy). Compared to the Altman classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great work of art.
