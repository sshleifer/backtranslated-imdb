It is better to show what I really think Jesus was. most movies show that Jesus is effeminate, lobotomized, or tortured. this jesus laughed, joked and became serious when it was necessary. this is the kind of person Jesus could be attracted to, not the generally Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film took some liberties, trying to "fill in the blanks". but the fillings did not seem impossible, or even improbable. One thing I could argue is that it never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus. (The movie portrayed the Romans as the main driver of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea.) <br /> <br /> It looked like the movie was searched well. An example was the improvised commentary for a teenager who was called a "brand". It is believed that the mark (or john mark) was the boy referred to in the garden of Gethsemane whose cloak was pulled and fled naked (Mark 14:51). I got the impression that they tried to make the film as accurate (even in spirit) as possible.
