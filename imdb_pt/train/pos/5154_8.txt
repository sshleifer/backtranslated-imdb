As an amateur historian of World War II in Germany, I could not wait for this to come out on DVD. I lost when it was first in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on historical inaccuracies. A better job could have been done portraying the "charming" Hitler. I also had a little problem with some of the cast choices, not so much for their acting but for their appearances. Peter Stormare does not look very much like Rohm, why did not they make Babson like Hess wear a wig? And my biggest complaint ... a lot was always made of Hitler's striking blue eyes, why did not they make Carlyle use blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked very good. Again, as long as people who watch this understand that this should be entertainment in the first place, I do not think that much damage will be caused.
