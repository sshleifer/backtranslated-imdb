This movie is a lot of fun to watch if you like movies of the organized crime variety. Those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic leadership with dreams of taking a bad stand may get a little disappointed with the way this movie moves. <br /> <br /> It's a fun joke through a crime underworld, however, and if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies then you might be pleasantly surprised by this. I was a little disappointed with some of the choices made, but overall a good crime film. Some things did not make sense, but that seems to be the norm with movies from the Orient. <br /> <br /> People simply do things randomly regardless of how their personalities were created before. It's a slightly irritating pattern that permeates even in this movie.
