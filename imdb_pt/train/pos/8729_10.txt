The life of an insect is an excellent resource for animation. This movie is for young children, but it's also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He wreaked havoc on his colony when he destroyed the food of the top locusts. It is banned and needs to find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would suffice. The dubbing is good as in most animation films. Music is good to hear. Nothing special, but earned a nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie seemed terrified. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
