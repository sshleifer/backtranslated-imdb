This is a military drama that I really like! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is not absurd, in your face, and no question is asked of the kind of person who does the work. There you have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT employee, D.C., who works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two are paired, the sparks must be flying. It is like. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other shooter hits, it is intelligence against intelligence, cat against mouse, sniper against sniper. And when the experienced sniper gets caught, it's up to Miller to put the policy aside and save it. Anyone who needs a policy when you are a professional like Beckett, he has not received orders from anyone other than himself, plays by the rules and not by the book, and mutual respect is revealed despite politics. The film was a direct hit. Watch. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
