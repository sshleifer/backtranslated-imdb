Dick Tracy was originally a comic created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a plain-clothes detective who traces a team of villains, ranging from all kinds of visually original characters such as Flattop, The Blank, Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created their own vision of Tracy's style villains in Daffy Duck drawings.) Tracy's comics were known for her liberal use of shootings and the up-to-date technological advances (notably the wristwatch communicator), which had its share of screen time in this great film. The song was beautifully done by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting but not the highlight of her career. It's strange because when you watch the movie and watch the moments of suspense, the film looks a lot like Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound in his plays. <br /> <br /> I love the tough boy, Pacino is acting like Big Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna's view of villainy, and the direction and cinematography were impeccable. (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, and many more.) This film was made very professionally and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this movie was made. Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost as if Beatty has seen herself as Tracy in a past life or something, because it really fits the part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8/10 for everything it brought to the cinema that was forgotten. (For any reason). There have been many misunderstandings about the rating of this movie in IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, as were the style of the scenery, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this movie. Go buy it today. You will not regret.
