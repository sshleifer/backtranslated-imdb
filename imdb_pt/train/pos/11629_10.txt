Red Eye is an exciting film from Freddy Kreuger's creator, Wes Craven. Wes Craven portrays the story of a regular hotel employee, Lisa. After attending her grandmother's funeral, she decides to take the flight out of her red eyes. During the wait, she meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) And they sort of become friends. Ironically, they both sit next to each other on this plane. That's when the horror begins. This movie is exciting and for the weak-hearted people who do not like horror / thrilling movies, well let's say it's possible they can pee their pants. This is an excellent example of a bone shake production. Wes Craven did well with this movie. He has chosen the right actors, such as Rachel McAdams, a smart, sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is wary of everything when she's in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the creepy and scary actor who can calm his bones in his incredible acting being the bad character in this movie, and his face can actually widen his eyes. Wes Craven did a great job and I hope he does more movies like this.
