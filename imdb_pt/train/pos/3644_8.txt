The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40-year-old teacher in Big Lake, Texas, reaching the largest. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small-town high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team is losing terribly until the team finds out that their coach has played in minor leagues and can play a pitch of 98 km / h. After playing the practice of batting and a bet is made, Jim agrees that if his team wins regional, he will try for the major leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy being a boy to play in his first game in the majors. It's a great story of underdog and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worthwhile, giving an emotional performance and is backed by an excellent supporting cast that includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow, but everything works well until the end. The baseball scenes are fun, well shot and portrayed in an excellent way. The movie is not about baseball, but about finding a man to achieve his dream. It's inspirational, it's emotional and it's funny. I liked it, I hope so. <br /> <br /> The newbie. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
