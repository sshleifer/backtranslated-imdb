Wow. Something of a surprise. Although I fail, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The all-new Arcturus space ship with about 3,000 passengers is in the last days of its sixteen-day Jupiter voyage. Without warning, the Cerebral (central computer) of the ship sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. Soon, only a handful of people will remain, including one of the ship's astrologers (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the director of the navigation line (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main Cerebral is acting erratically. The remaining passengers and crew must escape from the ship and avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. The opening commercial is a very nice touch. There are obvious parallels for 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Titanic's historic shipwreck. The movie sometimes slows down and has trouble going on, but it's usually well done and well represented.
