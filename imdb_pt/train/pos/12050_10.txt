Most horror movies are actually horrible movies. They even become the same ol 'same ol'. Same pack of every minute with some cheap emotion (usually 'splatter') and nowadays they can pack every second with garish special effects. One of the goals of a good horror film is to suspend the public's disbelief. For example, I've seen the two recent Mummy movies and I almost went dizzy seeing ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars a second to make these movies and my sense of disbelief has never been suspended, it has taken root. <br /> <br /> Subtlety can be more terrifying. Less is more. <br /> <br /> I first saw 'The Woman in Black' on channel A & E. After flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television, I stopped to watch it. This film almost feels like a 'Masterpiece Theater' production. This was good for me, I always preferred the British TV and movies anyway. <br /> <br /> Most viewers think this is too slow. But the slow pace helps to give credibility to the story. The special effects are few, which soothes the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world, making us a little more uncomfortable. The make-up and costumes for the ghost are kept simple and believable. Hollywood would have made her look like an infernal demon with bright eyes, claws, etc. Hollywood would have made an exaggeration and turned that idea into mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The woman only makes five appearances in the film. Most of them are where she appears from a distance and even this creates a good scare. If she showed up too often, it could cheapen the weather as she prepares. However, this film is so well done that through much of the film we are led to realize that it is there all the time but not visible. The scene in which she "visits" Arthur Kidd late at night and sees her a little too close is a masterpiece in horror. <br /> <br /> This is just an extraordinary movie that I think should be considered one of the best. horror movies ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and an extra zillion. I have not seen anything that heads "The Woman in Black", though I'm still looking. This film is so well done that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) at a time when I almost had doubts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke with people who occasionally fear that she might appear standing in the middle of the road or that I see her looking out my window, etc. Maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall looking at me with her hateful look. That's what a great horror movie should be. As a LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black very slowly pulls you and wraps itself around your neck and before you know it, it's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late. <br /> <br /> The closest thing I have to criticism is that this was done for the small screen ... and it's a pity that this is out of print. I just paid over $ 40 for my second copy of this movie. It's a big prize in my collection. Now I'm in search of an even better horror film that not only gives shivers but also qualifies a sound drama.
