Calling this a romantic comedy is necessary, but nowadays misleading. The genre unfortunately deteriorated into clichés, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it stereotyped and overly predictable. <br /> <br /> The shop around the corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a recognizably Middle / Eastern-European atmosphere and has a strong cast beyond nominal (also strong) connections; I avoid using the words "support cast", as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role for the film and its story is equally, if not more important than the novel. <br /> <br /> The 1998 film You Got Mail lent the idea of ​​the 'anonymous friend' of this movie and therefore was heralded as a remake. This is not right and, in fact, unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and lends a plot element, but that's all.
