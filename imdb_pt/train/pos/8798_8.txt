First of all, I will not praise IÃ±arritu's short film, even though he is Mexican and proud of his success in the mainstream of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I see that most reviews focus on their opinions. favorite short films (and not so); but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line circulating throughout the compilation, and it may not be so pleasing to the American people. (Even if that was not the main objective of the producers) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most of the short films do not show the suffering that the WASP people went through because the terrorist attack on September 11th, but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I'm saying? You see, in the short film in Bosnia, the message is: "You cry because of the people who died in the Towers, but we (The Others = Eastern Europeans) have been crying for a long time for crimes committed against our women and nobody pays attention how the whole world has done to you. " <br /> <br /> Although the story of Burkina Faso is more comedy, there is the same thought: "You are angry because Osama Bin Laden punched you in an evil but we (the Others = Africans) should be more angry, because our people have been dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS for a long time, and no one pays attention to us as the whole world has done to you. " <br /> <br /> Look now at Sean Penn's short: The Fall of the Twin Towers makes it happy for a lonely (and alienated) man. So the message is that Power and Greed (symbolized by the Towers) must fall to allow people to see the sun rise and the flowers bloom? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to being subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (much known for his anti-capitalist ideology) is much clearer and shameless in going straight to the point: "You're angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but we (the others = Latin Americans) suffered on a similar date something worse, and no one remembers our pain as the whole world has done to you. " <br /> <br /> It is as if the creative of this project meant to tell Americans, "You see now, America? You are not the only one who has become a victim of the world's violence, you are not alone in your pain and by the way , we (the Others = Non-Americans) have suffered much more than you long ago, so we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and, by the way, we are sorry because you have had a bit of yours own remedy "Only the Mexican and French short films showed some compassion and sympathy for the American people; the others are like a slap in the face of the American state, which is not like the American people.
