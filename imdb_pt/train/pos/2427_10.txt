This is really a great unknown film. Perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s. This film had the talent of the actor and was withdrawn. He still had a bit of comedy in it, but it was not exaggerated. Once in life is what is supposed to be a criminal drama, not the special typical that it affects the trash with sex. I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all. <br /> <br /> Now, about the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was excellent at playing a career criminal. It's a shame he can only show his talent in his own film. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's half-brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly tempered film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a monkey grease / drug boss. I loved his acting since "King of New York". But the best performances in this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were paired perfectly like two Calderon henchmen. <br /> <br /> Once in a lifetime is surely a keeper. **** 1/2 * out of *****.
