Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the evaluations that do this among Errol Flynn's greatest rides in a career of great outings. I think this paper boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the bucks he was typecast. Flynn looked like a party animal from his memories and was a guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. The extra thing I wanted to point out is watching the great montages, transitions and insertions that punctuate the movie. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent flynn collaborator with director of photography Sid Hickox, the montages were made by a rising editor named Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel went that far, but he's listed in the credits. He would go for a great career as a director of action.
