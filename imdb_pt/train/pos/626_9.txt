The power of dreaming is a wonderful thing. There is a saying: "Not all dreamers can, but all entrepreneurs dream." By exploring our imagination, we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Maybe it will overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit humanity. Or (simply) find the way to true love and happiness. Freud can express these things in symbols. The language of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Tristan ventures into an English village called Wall. He goes through a wall fracture. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love for Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria does not take him too seriously. Then he promises to bring back a shooting star. <br /> <br /> Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovers that the fallen star took the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat your heart, it will replenish your youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who makes fabulous, young transformations of looks and manners.) The 'good guy' they meet on the way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce pirate exterior, braggart, but it's a queen from the closet underneath. Meanwhile, the heirs of Stormhold are engaged in a pitched battle over the inheritance of the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an additional addition. A merchant of clowns playing well in standard gags of the Gervais type. Tristan's purity of spirit awakens Yvaine's love, so there is a beautiful little triangle in progress. Until he reaches maturity to discern divas from the pedestal of real women. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a full-scale fantasy that credits its myriad of stars. Totally positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis than a coven full of Harry Potter jokes. Production values ​​rival Hollywood, and the plot is free of racial stereotypes, misogyny, religious or class agendas rather than shaping and perverting so many fantasies on a grand scale. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Stardust has no flaws. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the quality of the fairy tale can be very saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this movie may well provide that. <br /> <br /> When I was a boy, I remember hearing the Moody Blues albums marveling (I practiced in a house not far away). from where I lived). They made albums with names like "In Search of the Lost Chord" and wrote lyrics like "Thinking is the best way to travel." I filled my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people can talk about NLP or positive thinking. Adults who remember how to dream about the strength of youth, but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still like this feeling? <br /> <br /> It is advisable not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See on the largest movie screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound, if you can. The actors seem to have a ball. Maybe you will too.
