I do not care if you would like my comment or not but I think you who writes that the movie is not good ... you are so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can not see how good this movie is I am not Jay Chou fan, but I like your play and not only him ... and it might be that you think there is not a big sense in the idea and it may be that you think it's not so interesting, but look deep there is more that action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than US in the world and it's good :) very good. And it cost a lot to do this so please do not criticize the actors that the directors do you do not know how difficult they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thanks :)
