This movie really deserves more recognition than its getting. It really is an impressive and rich portrait of blood ties, favors and alliances within the world of crime. The film is filmed beautifully and delves into all of its classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This movie is a movie film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards totally in the end. He is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change instead of another martial arts epic wire frame fight that seems to be the main contribution to the movie world of hong kong and china. It features an array of great characters, actors and development, although it's fair to say that I had to watch it twice just to preach what was happening to some of the characters, due to being so many interactions in the movie. ALl in all 8/10 Great plot characters, but there are characters that do not stand out enough and the music did not really make me go and sometimes I felt that I did not sync well with the action (there is action by the way), so misses a few points for this.
