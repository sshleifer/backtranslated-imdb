A wonderfully quirky movie with enough touches for a bag of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable and loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. The story is very ironic and dialogue cleverly underestimated. Suggestions of humor and intrigue, none of which dominates the characterization that Posey does so well. The support cast is stellar. The disadvantage? This movie needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the movie and making notes. Posey has more sexual appeal when raising an eyebrow than most actresses have throughout her body. It is worth your time, even if you do not understand the outcome.
