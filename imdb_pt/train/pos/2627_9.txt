Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own film ... 'Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a new irreverent version of a classic tale. What a classic tale, you ask? Why, "The Lion King" of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is one thing that Disney is never short, it is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that this is not a good movie. Basically, it is the events of "The Lion King", according to the perspective of Timon and Pumba. And that's why you're going to have to know the story of 'The Lion King' by heart to see where they're coming from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on one level I was watching this and thinking "Oh my god this is so bad ..." and on another level I was having a ball. A lot of humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumba makes up two beds, a big one for himself and a little one for Timon, inside the first nanosecond, we all know that Timon's going to get the big one. But that does not stop it from being hilarious, which, IMO, is "Hakuna Matata" in a nutshell. It's not what happens, it's like. <br /> <br /> And a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in a movie where Pumbah is the center of attention? But, as fart jokes, these are especially good, and should satisfy even the most specific connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The voice talent that comes back is great. I'm kind of surprised that some of the actors were willing to go back, with most of them having only two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is great too. From 'Digga Tunnah' at the beginning of 'That's All I Need', an adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song that was cut from 'The Lion King' and frankly much improved in this incarnation), music leaves me nothing complain. In the end, Timon and Pumba are incredible characters, and although it can be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various compromising and fun situations then, whatever. It's rare to find characters with whom you want to spend some time. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to sound scary? <br /> <br /> Anyway, 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you've ever seen 'The Lion King' many times. Especially if you are thinking now "Do not be silly, there is no such thing as seeing 'The Lion King' many times!"
