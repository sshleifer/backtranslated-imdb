It is said that The Movies and Baseball were successful during the Great Depression. It seems that the gloomy realities of a nation achieved after the economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the population. A temporary escape could be found in the ongoing novel that is Baseball. <br /> <br /> In the same way, an occasional 2 or 3 hour excursion in the dark auditoriums of the Cinema. The presence of a radio in almost every household kept Depression Era America immediately attuned to the World Events and provided many drama and (especially) comedy spectacles for a pleasant interlude of harsh reality. <br /> <br /> The literature of the time also flourished on all levels. Juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the Comic Book did not magically appear, fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages by itself. There were mediums who were ancestors to them. Obviously, the Newspaper Comic Strip magazine was one of the parents, providing the visual / narrative method of storytelling. <br /> <br /> The other direct ancestor was Pulp Magazine. The cheap, prose publications that contained a great deal of stories from the same adventurous characters, though not necessarily serialized, tales. The pulp medium had been in existence for a few decades and featured us at TARZAN by Edgar Rice Borrough and Johnston McCulley's FOX. The 1930s spawned a crop of characters such as THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8 BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER, MASTER of MEN, all coming to the newsstands, among many others. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, a pureblood superhero of written history; the layers of the pulps might have been the only "image" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super-sharp senses, and a genius-class intellect, Doc was the prototype of the Superhero. He also gathered 5 of his former Army friends into a small, adventurous team. Each of them was an expert in a particular field. So we had a maximum grade: Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrician, Geologist-Archaeologist-Paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and '40s and were published. in the mid-50's. So they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. So brainstorming came to reassemble the old novels into a new "container", the pocket book. A new look at the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually torn shirt. <br /> <br /> The re-introduction proved to be a great success, with the publication of one title per month (and for a little while). Soon there was a rumor from a Doc Savage movie! But when, by what producer? Well, the venerable "Bronze Man" has returned to the news for over 10 years before any real project was set up. He was the veteran Stop-action Animator and Producer of the main films of Special Effects, Geoprge Pal, that made the film along with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, BRONZE'S MAN came to the movies, he boasted of a well-formed team of actors, though largely "No Name" as familiarity with viewers. With ex-Tarzan from TV, Ron Ely's almost perfect cast in the lead, the beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the lead role and veteran character Paul Wexler (as the villain Captain of the Seas); no other name would have been recognized. And, perhaps, this was an advantage in this case. <br /> <br /> History does a good job at getting the majority of the audience to become familiar with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot. Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short clips are the method followed to lead the introduction to the main body of the story. <br /> <br /> From the outset, there are indications that this story will go with the same kind of humor "Camp" made as the Batman TV series. Some great early scenes involving Doc and the whole team making their individual specialties are brought to humor by Paul Frees' narration and unexpected and improbable results. (For example, a Doc experiment with a miniature rocket / missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a little to that.) The whole story unfolds like this, hitting the viewer with a small 'Camp' all so many times, to remind us not to take it too seriously. We are also intrigued by the fact that Mr. George Pal to be the producer (his last). The one who was so well-known for Special Effects, certainly a factor that could be well used in a sci-fi action environment of the Pulp Character world. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him very vividly. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in the hospital, having just given birth to our second daughter, Michelle (08/14/75). Our eldest girl, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after the visiting hours ended at Maternity Ward, she went straight to the old Marquette Theater, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago. Having seen and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was kind of disappointed with the end product. I could accept some of this 'Camp' business, but I would not have objected if MrPal had decided to leave it all out and have some dinosaurs and volcanoes to give everything a little more Pulp / Comic / Series-type Excitement. <br /> <br /> And yet the cast, headed by Mr. Ely and the others, made the whole movie enjoyable if not lovable. The scenarios and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like a serial or adventure movie from the 1930's that would be enjoyable to anyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's exactly what they were trying to do. with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.
