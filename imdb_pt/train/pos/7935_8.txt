Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to live on even before the opening credits started. First, any piece of "... of the undead" invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets a high standard to which many films can not afford to aspire. Secondly, my movie-watching companion doubted any urban horror movie would outperform the semitic Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptical, we set out to watch. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie movie. Oh, surely the budget is low and of course the amateur friends of the directors cast, but the Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it is so cheap, you can see clearly where love holds you together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent for his younger brother at night. He dreams of leaving Oakland. Prior to this planned escape, however, his brother is shot dead in a drive-by. Ricky's sagacious scientific mind presents a choice over CPR or 911: injections of the experimental regenerative formula from his laboratory. Unfortunately, the little brother wakes up in an ambulance like a bloodthirsty zombie from Oakland! Chaos and clutter! I think it's more economical to eat your enemies than get revenge on a drive-by, but again, I'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life. (As a poor judge? In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I was thinking "Ah-ha! White T-shirts all over the world for blood to appear." I used the same technique in my own low-budget horror film "Jordan replied," No, it's a gang dress. White shirts were banned from New Orleans bars for a while as a result. "Oh.) Much of the movie is set in someone's living room , so there's a great deal of going out and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are friendly and the film is sincere - it surpasses its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Explanation of zombies: When man plays with God, zombies arise! Or maybe: Follow the FDA approved test rules before human experimentation! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the canon of the zombies: This is the first zombie movie I've seen with a gunfight. As far as the actual zombies go, the infection is spread with a bite as usual, but very rarely head shots do not work - it's heart shots that kill. Zombies have wrists, whose absence proves true death. And these zombies make nice jaguar-growling noises. <br /> <br /> Gratuitous zombie in-joke: A mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: Jaguar-noise brother, zombie, of course!
