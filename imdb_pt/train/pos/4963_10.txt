Let Braik make a good show. Finally he and Zorak are living their own lives off the Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say that I love these two shows a lot. They are completely what started Adult Swim. Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was very popular for many people who love Adult Swims shows. I have to say that out of all Adult Swim shows without any plot, this has to be the one that has no more storyline ever made. That's why I like it so much, it's one of those classics in Adult Swim's history. I believe this is a great show if you do not like it. Hey, there were tons they hated and tons they loved.
