Here's the first episode of Friends, where we're introduced to Control Freak, Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), newly divorced from Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and womanizer (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). It is as soon as the scene begins until we present to the 6th and last friend the spoiled child Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better than most of people believe that as in any new series, the first episode is not always fantastic. The acting in this episode is not great because the cast can not identify and really believe in their new characters (besides Kudrow and Perry - who shine Matt Le Blanc-Man, his performance was very bad, because until later he gets more confident, but I think he tries to be funny, but at the most failure. David Schimmer that he uttered all the words? can not speak normally! But he has become one of the funniest characters in later times, but he is not confident. And I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston- It looks hot, and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in Season 1, Courtney Cox- It looks quite anorexic in this episode, it's worrying, it looks totally different now, (more healthily), she's acting is a little modest, but everyone is in this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I'm doing these two together because their comedic timing and acting quality was superb and for Lisa this was one of their first roles and she's as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry are there little Matthew Perry playing basically! The quality of the episode improves later ... like the Sets, they look dark and scary in this episode and make them look hostile, the acting is good, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and I'm proud that this is the pilot ! I hope to see friends get together! because they will always be there for us!
