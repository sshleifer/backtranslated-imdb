I thought this was a splendid showcase for Mandy's body bod. If you expect nothing more, such as clever twists and development of believable characters, you will not be disappointed. Consider this as a Sports Illustrated footage whose character revolves around killing people, especially those who threaten to stay between her and her 'mama' (Suzanna Arquette, who obviously does not want to play the sex pussy - she leaves it to her daughter) Mandy's face is a bit too perfect, but her body is a full 5-alarm fire, up in the ranks of Sophia Loren when it comes to natural upheaval, a perfect 7-for-10. proportion of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs, down to the feet. (There has to be some ideal calf knee thigh setting that is totally pleasing to the eye, Mandy is certainly the model for this idealized proportion.) <br /> <br /> And no flat ass to boot, which seems to be the ruin of many big cats with curves everywhere, except in the "lower hemispheres." Mandy could have used a double body on the back of her loss of her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her No. 2 German Eyeshadow Victim but all I could see of her photos of bikini, she had Mandy's acting skills had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'Mommy's Girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian implications. Her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be trampled in the bathtub after a long flirtation with German # 2, who was also her mother's lover) added an additional dimension to a one-dimensional caricature of adolescent feminine horniness in conflict with pathological and homicidal impulses always by the water with the men - the final destiny of the Latin housekeeper was published in the televised version for some obscure reason). Mandy's Uber-Nordic facial features along with her Uber- Voluptuous Body could be a blessing or a curse. If Mandy really wants to promote her acting career, I would advise her to immerse herself completely in the Romance languages, especially in Italian and Spanish - and perhaps in French, though I do not know if they would choose her type. But that would allow her to reconcile her face with Bo Derek with her body in Life War - but maybe her face was a little too Nordic, and she showed a lot of her extraordinary body in a rough movie to allow her to advance to anyone. more fame than was enjoyed by Michelle Johnson of the 1980s, whose early fame at Blame it on Rio was followed by a series of skin films that could not get off the ground. <br /> <br /> Vambo Drule.
