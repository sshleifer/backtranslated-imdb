Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he pays more than that with his exaggerated interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. As Scott stands before a large window, the sunlight throws a shining mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Raised by Scott's voice, a heavy grunt, the effect is galvanizing ... as well as Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The horror", indeed! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, the same thing that works for you may also work against you. Because Scott exhibits such fierce ferocity throughout the film, he appears infectious. To put it another way, the "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after" even though he really should not be. This is what you might call the "Doctor Smith" effect, as Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach to playing this role and several other heavyweights (stage and screen). <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not even consider Scott's simplistic anger a responsibility. But other purists of "Christmas Carol" can. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
