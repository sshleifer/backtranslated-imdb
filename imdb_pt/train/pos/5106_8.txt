I think every time I see one of those old 80's movies, it puts me back at a simpler time, no matter how mean-hearted they may seem today. This movie is good. I remember seeing it as a small child and thinking it was the best movie ever. There are all the heroic characters a young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I really know what's going on. I found it strange. How many people can move to Houston and stay with Sissy, marry, switch to a trailer, have a disagreement, cheat, have an uncle die, and then get back together, all over the course of a month? Only in America.
