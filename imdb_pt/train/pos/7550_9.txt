Wow. A truly fantastic 'travel' movie that has tons of super-surreal images, dark intent and a dark and rather strange feel of how cartoon animals should see the world. It is filled with a bunch of very cute out-of-the-world characters who bend over and flow with distorted backgrounds. In all legal fantasy, the wandering plot is secondary to the creepy visuals and we followed a small cat and his sister zombie as they faced death, flood, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs they fished. I've never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal work of the American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It is a demented delight for fans of strange and beautiful things, and I stuck to the screen for fear of losing something incredible. Simply put, it's 'Hello Kitty' without the 'o'.
