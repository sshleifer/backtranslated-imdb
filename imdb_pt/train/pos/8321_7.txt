This is a nice film, even if the premise is silly. It was a kind of guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to play roles in this type of film (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano). That's what makes it a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, had this ability too, and he really puts himself on paper, making Einstein fun and kind-hearted. I suppose you could say that they are both good at playing lovely characters, though they are adorable in different ways (lovely vs. grumpy lovely girls).
