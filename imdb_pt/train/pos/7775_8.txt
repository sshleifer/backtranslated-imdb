Other in the they do not do it like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in their closet still qualifies as a good cleaning, sometimes fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley brothers, and they actually took over the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the rather soft connections. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could be called bad actors, but both had better parts and played them much more convincingly than here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson as a red-blooded heterosexual like he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that does not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film, which is considerable and this film is extremely watchable. If you wake up some night and this movie shows up, I'd say. Worth it.
