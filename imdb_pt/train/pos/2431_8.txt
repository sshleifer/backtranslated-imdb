Famous was "famous" for his tension and cartoon style launch where the semi-main character is in terrible danger, only to be rescued by the hero at the last second. This Casper in particular is the only one I can remember where death really takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The constant in the cartoons of Famous Studios is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always gets to his spinach in time, Baby Huey always fools the fox, Little Audery always "learns his lesson." And some FS cartoons are really somber and depressing. <br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. as much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry," I do not think anyone was pitching a better cartoon product than Paramount. Color, Animation, Music (The Great Winston Sharples), Editing, Voices. They were consistent and a brilliant example of the best that the art form had to offer.
