Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, in this rough and ready to starring noir: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is complete with a well written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected twists, and clever dialogues and a pleasing eye to eye with great camera moves and dark and gritty film noir lighting. Dana Andrews plays detective Mark Dixon, part mafioso and part police, who has the reputation of being physically very hard with criminals. After a case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets involved much more than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in his role - tough and daring, Andrews' Dixon is ready to knock down all his heels if they get on the bad side. He's the perfect noir anti-hero movie - he's not very cool all the time, but we still hope for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in his role, however good it may be, being a sweet shoulder to Dixon. There may not be much for the role of Tierney, but she certainly goes beyond what others could do with the role, knocking down all members of the audience with her kind smile, gentle ways and glitter in her eyes. The supporting cast is not all that bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, coming in and giving a good performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, but it's a great noir movie full of great characters, stories and photos.
