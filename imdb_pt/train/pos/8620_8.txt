I just watched the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were fascinated. I will not bother repeating what others have said. What filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. Then we were shocked to discover that it was still almost 30 minutes away, but that did not stop us from getting fully involved and having fun. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost ruined it and that was the horror. music / music. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all start laughing. It's awful. You've been warned, but the story and the narrative keep you anchored. <br /> <br /> There are several striking moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow motion photography that works beautifully. I really wish I could delete the song, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Look for this. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you would not expect and it's very refreshing.
