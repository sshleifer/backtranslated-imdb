Home Room was a great movie if you ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Wondering what the secret Alice is hiding. I think I watched the movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Also, I usually do not cry because of movies, but this one made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like that. All in all I thought it was a great movie. The more you watch, the more you become a part of it. The ending is the part that really caught me when she cried when she got her diploma because she had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had broken in that moment. And how her new friend came to console her when she had not yet got hers. I loved it so much.
