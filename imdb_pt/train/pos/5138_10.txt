In 1994, I had a very long vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days in a row with two weeks of paid vacations, weekends and holidays. I stayed in the city during this time, going out a lot at my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not have TV in my apartment, so I used to see my parents' tube. I had just watched a segment of the X Files when a program came up called Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I have always been fascinated by items in our home that came from my parents 'homes and through inheritances from relatives' properties, and I often wondered about their history, value, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation I used to go to my parents' house in my lunch hour just to get Personal FX. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once she said the renovations were completed Personl FX would return to air. <br /> <br /> It never happened! The FX staff was the first and best of the collectible shows. And disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still sore. <br /> <br /> Way to go, FX.
