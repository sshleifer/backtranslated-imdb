A recent THA'S ENTERTAINMENT show made me want to watch many of MGM's music classics of the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a smaller film than ON THE TOWN. The songs are not so good, nor the chemistry between the characters. But the film intertwines beautifully classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above at the top, and then down the stairs, while dozens of pianists play piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music that the pianists are playing. Sinatra then sings: "I Fall In Love Easily," before having his epiphany about who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and pollution free air (can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, much less the mid-1940s!), And piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had a talent for creating such lyrical moments.
