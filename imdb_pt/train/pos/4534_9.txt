Vaguely intended as a satire of D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, The Three Ages was Buster Keaton's first attempt in a comedy feature film. The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening "book" scene and the fact that similar stories across the ages are edited together into one complete film. Keaton's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it did not succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three winders. Luckily, The Three Ages is brilliantly a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any Keaton movie. There is nothing original or daring about the story lines. They are simple plots of boy-girl-girl, boy-lose-girl, boy-and-girl, but the satires of the period are unbridled and set the standard for future work by Mel Brooks and all films of that genre. However, I do not believe anyone has overcome this comedy. No one can play the kind goof like Keaton and the acrobatics in this movie are some of their best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as Keaton's rival increases the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks the comedy of the 1920s can not be appreciated by the modern public needs to see this movie.
