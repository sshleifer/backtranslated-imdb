Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​is tried for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses testify - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelm's brother, Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelm's ex-lover Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in self-defense. The film ends after the court sums it up. The film is counted in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses positions himself. The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village's reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), whom Wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of Jewish villagers as they prepare to be transferred to concentration camps; and the cult in the church where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces his Nazi creation while lamenting his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), Marja's daughter, after she was shot in a brothel. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Knox does not regret and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and combines with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This movie offers an effective story that stays with you as soon as you finish.
