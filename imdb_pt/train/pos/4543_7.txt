Well, no, I tell you a lie, this is not really the best movie of all time, but it's a really nice movie that no one I know has ever seen it. <br /> <br /> It's a friend thriller starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) with some cute story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that does not matter. The reason this movie is entertaining is because of the interaction between the two leaders who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate they end up becoming friends. The whole cultural difference is very well done, it's fun to watch, it's completely ridiculous, but in a tacky and enjoyable way. The soundtrack is cool, again in an extravagant style of the 80s, adapts to the film, I have been trying to find one of the songs for centuries, but as I am working from memory than I think some of the words I I can not find. <br /> <br /> Another thing that this movie has is the most fantastic reward of any movie of all time, but I will not give it up, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film over 48 hours \ most of Eddie Murphys' production, including the Beverly Hills cop, and anything that Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence had in their names. If you are looking for a friend's cop movie and are getting tired of "white straight cop finds black streetwise zany cop" give it a try. You may be pleasantly surprised that this turns the whole formula upside down with "the heterosexual Japanese policeman meets the street-crazy white cop". <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 7. to be honest I like it more than that. I'd rather watch it than lots of things I'd give. 8. But I think I know deep down that it's some kind of insanity that makes me like this movie.
