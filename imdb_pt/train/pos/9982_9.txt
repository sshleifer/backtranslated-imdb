I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages to be released here in Canada (still only in limited release). It was worth the wait and then some. I am an avid reader of Margaret Laurence and I was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film. I really liked the movie better than the novel. I liked that Bram Shipley's character was a bit less harsh, and there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no nicer in the movie than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in that role. She was Hagar completely. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many other great things to come, I'm sure. His scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on, in general, a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and I can not wait for him to come out on DVD, a must own for my collection!
