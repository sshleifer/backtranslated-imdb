... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). plus a great fan service for fans (well, that was redundant ~), it was the story that surprised me. Hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people will disagree with me about it, but it was not one of the three great actors (the guys who played Sho, son and Kei) who gave the best performance (for me at least). was Taro Yamamoto, Boy # 5 of the Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like Hyde, I love his voice, but the problem is that some of his scenes got a little "out", but I loved that scene in which he danced with the body of the dead guy killing the other guys. and Gackt was not that bad either, I preferred how his character was kind of indifferent from the start. There is nothing I can say about my past in Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the cast full of stars. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (sorry for my spelling if you're wrong). while the full song lasts about nine minutes, you would not notice the duration because you would be enjoying listening to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Either way, this movie is a must-see not only for fans (large fanbase ~), but for those who enjoy science fiction, futuristic, Asian-style films.
