Romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? You'll see one that's really honeyed, and you'll think you want something more realistic. So you will see one that is realistic but can be very annoying to keep you interested. Or maybe you see one that does everything right, but it can not make you smile. Romantic comedies are difficult films. You enter them with high expectations, and generally, if you like, it's simply a matter of whether the movies were anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl at your side. <br /> <br /> If you have a girl by your side, and you are a guy like me, it probably does not matter much if the movie is good, you have other things in mind. To you, I say, "Go get her, tiger!" To the rest of us, I say, "See _A Guy Thing_." It is very fun. <br /> <br /> Because _To Guy Thing_ knows that you are going to this movie with expectations, so do not pretend that your "guy about to get married meets the woman of your dreams and is not your wife!" will make everyone happy. Of course, you may like it, but it may not seem true, or you think it's cruel. Guy Thing covers that. What Guy _ Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best support cast I've seen in a long time, so if you do not do the main plot, you still have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> If we are talking about experienced veterans of the big and small screen, such as Larry Miller (Beautiful Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner and Conan O'Brien regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty), or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we're talking a lot of very talented and skillful actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterization steal the show, time after time, and still shape the play with energy and joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days. <br /> And this is not to shrink the actual romantic line and the stars that lead together because it is very sweet and terrib well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) is playing as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control, and Selma Blair shows a discreet glint in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman that every guy wants to get married , except for the guy he really is. <br /> <br /> Much of the success of the film, however, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she wears well. Since then, I do not know when, I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that made falling in love with her so easy. Of course, everything is in the closes, the voice and the subtle smiles, but it's magic, and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles sophistication slightly out of the ordinary would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is incredibly dead in its classic simplicity. This is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable kinds of actions, causes them to fall on each other to make you laugh, and then comes with a big heart. A Face Thing is a movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew this when they were preparing to do it. We have not really seen any new romantic comedy since Shakespeare; the relative success of this or that is entirely dependent on the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl. A Guy Thing actually adopts this with a bit of metakinetics, often taking the scenes to absurdity, in order to give the audience the chance to recognize the powerful emotions and the ancient plots in action. <br /> <br /> the album, it also succumbs to the more traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even feminists can have fun with it. <br /> <br /> And personally, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to ruin everything for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest guys in the movies, I suggest you say "It's a Dude Thing", and leave it alone.
