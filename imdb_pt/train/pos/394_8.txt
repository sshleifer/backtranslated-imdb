This is an incredible return from the mentor of the film director, Tsui Hark. It is one of the few films that deserves a face-to-face contest with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the film began, there were astronomical scenarios at all ends that were depleted with a superb style. Whether you are a science fiction or Chinese "geek" martial arts, you will love the excessive amount of many realistic 3D effects and computer generated weapons. There, comes a good performance (as always) by Ekin Cheung, who plays "Sky King". He joins Louis Koo (Red), who was very impressed with his flexible "wing", which diverted the attacks received. The fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way. Not only is the action superb, it also has a somewhat complex plot. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of story / theme or just "thrust into random pieces of debrise" and even describe it as "The Legend of Poo." However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga to understand this movie. Others who are famarialy with "Wu Xia" movies will have a better appoach. In due respect. there may be a weakness that could be predicted. The blow that was delivered to the enemy in the last scene of the fight could have been made in a more substantial and devastating way. Despite all this, you must see it.
