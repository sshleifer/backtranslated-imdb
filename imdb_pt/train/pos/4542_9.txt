Centered in downtown and out of Detroit skirts, this comedy I found to be a fantastic new comic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of a thief of industrial secrets, who stole a supercharger 'proto type' turbocharger, reluctantly goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with the character of 'Jay Leno,' a fast-talking 'speaker, but even a business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross, however, the honorable 'Paths' of Japan find the old-fashioned Detroit police investigator 'Maneiras'. The two stumble and stumble at each other at first, but then develop a 'rhythm' that turns into an explosive two-tier team that solves the case, cold. After fighting a city crime boss for the stolen 'equipment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and the need for an extended vacation on top of everything, they manage to reach a victorious closure. I rated this as a 9. Lewis direction makes this a near-perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
