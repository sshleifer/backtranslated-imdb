I did not expect to be so impacted by this movie portraying a family as you would expect to be living in the house next door. They are average flesh and blood people, not like the typical Hollywood food. They face a very common problem - debilitating disease. But the story line grabs the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, screenplay, direction and acting flow along with a wave that draws the viewer into the story. Give this movie your full attention and your message will be truly inspiring.
