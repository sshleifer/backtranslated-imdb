"Kaabee" portrays a woman's difficulties in pre and post World War II, raising her children alone after her husband was arrested for "crime of thought". This film was directed by Yamada Youji and, as expected, the atmosphere of this movie is truly wonderful. Although the historical correction of some scenes, most notably the beach scene, is a suspect. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I'm confused by how they managed to put together this cast of stars for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most lively actress in Japan, will undoubtedly receive more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also very good. It was Asano Tadanobu, however, who made the most impressive presentation, portraying perfectly the cunning of his character and the difficult situation in which he was. <br /> <br /> Movies with the pre-war scenario are not my thing, but thanks to the wonderful direction and acting, I was totally absorbed in the story. In addition, it was not a far-left absurd like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni," and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred during that period in Japan. Excellent film, highly recommended for all viewers.
