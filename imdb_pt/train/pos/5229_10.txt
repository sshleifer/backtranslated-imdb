This movie has received horrible ratings from almost everyone who voted here, but I'm here to tell you if you like movies like Dude Wheres my car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If your in films like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id have to suggest you in a different angle. However, I still love this movie and all about it, even if it's kiddy sort of, this is one of the few movies that my friends and I could keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible. GREAT MOVIE. This movie owes the number 1 of the AFI, because it's such a damn high class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have trouble seeing it because it was made for a TV movie on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, I would buy it for DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still have recorded from when it was first, you can come if you want and watch it, but I could be sleeping. This movie rocks and that's basically all you need to know.
