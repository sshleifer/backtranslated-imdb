This is a cult thing. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I've seen this movement dozens of times and I still have not appreciated it. The actors are funny and they improve with every performance! If you liked "Morons from Out of Space" you will love this. A great move in the War of the Worlds. I love the flurry of Red Neck to catch the aliens, the insect on the hood, the DOD, the Annihilator, the Field of Mines, the Red Camo, breaking the speed limit at 1800Mph! "I'll get the bucket!" Very funny. I would love this to come out on DVD! Forget the negative reviews see for yourself!
