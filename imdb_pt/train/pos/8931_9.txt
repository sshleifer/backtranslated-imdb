The Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of the film. It follows its own spirit through time, space and character. There may be a plot, but what I understood I got from the description on the cover of the Netflix DVD. Honestly, it's probably best not to know anything about the movie before watching it, because the viewer can let go of any expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but also insults the fact that he or she will not get full understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the puzzle of the movie. Each image questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, the viewer's and Louis's. The character of Louis is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character. Honestly, anyone could have played the character of Louis, if he or she possessed a wandering, willing, and comfortable heart. However, Subor is the only one presented here; he becomes the film, his identity is inseparable from him. Many of the images in the movie that linger in my mind revolve around their expressions, vocal, but mostly physical. The Intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the stillness and fullness of motion, but more fluid than any literature in the form he refuses to take. "Surrealist" has been a term used in describing this film, but perhaps "quasi-realistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film exists outside the possibilities of reality; the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between the heart beat and the dim light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer a few times if you are attracted to visual images; watch the movie to see the consequences of combining verses and an attachment to freedom.
