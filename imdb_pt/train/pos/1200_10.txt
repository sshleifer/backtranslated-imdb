Have no illusions, this is a morality story. Granger is the troubled former buffalo hunter, tempted back to the plains once again by Taylor mad for killing. Granger can see that the end is near and deeply feels the cost of hunting the herds, the Indians and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand, is tantamount to killing buffalo, or Indians being "with a woman." While Granger's role in the tortured hunter is superb, it is Taylor who steals the show, as the immoral and immoral all-evil who seeks the quick money and the good time. There is not much bang here, but the story is fast moving, and we come across a great Nolan character performance. The theme of this story is as poignant today as in the 1800s man's relationship to the land and what is in it, and racism. Considering that this was done, the Censors should be twisting their handkerchiefs during scenes of the "obscene house," Taylor's relationship with the queen and much of the dialogue. Although pessimistic, this is indeed an excellent Western image.
