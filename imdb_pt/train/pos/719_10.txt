Although this film is tacky at its best, it is perfectly drawn. This film, undoubtedly, should be considered a modern classic. There are basically two types of movies I like - movies with depth (girls' movies, if you need to - I blame my wife for it) and irrational comedies where I can sit and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine called me for this movie right after its release. Considering me a little superficial, he told me, "You have to see this movie. It's just your kind of movie." Leaving aside the insult, I began to watch. I know they mentioned the Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it's the Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know if they were a real band." I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, although now somewhat dated, is a must see for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter.
