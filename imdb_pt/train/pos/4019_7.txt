Being that I'm not a Snoop Dogg fan, as an actor, it made me even more eager to check out this movie. I remember he was interviewed on "Jay Leno" and said he declined a role in the big budget comedy Adam Sandler "The Longest Yard" to be in this movie. So obviously Snoop was on a serious mission to prove he has acting skills. I will not overestimate Snoop for his performance in "The Tenants". Certainly there are better rappers / actors, like Mos Def, who could have done more with their role. But the point is that Snoop did a "good" job. He seems unable to get rid of some of his body movements and vocal inflections, but this is something that even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing. The point is that I found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and the character of Dylan McDermott captivating. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, although his subtle acting is probably overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle acting. Being a great reader and aspiring writer, I could not help but find the characters and plot a little fascinating. It irritated me how Snoop's character constantly asked McDermott to read his work, and scolded him for criticizing him. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that. Your character should have flaws, like McDermott, in his own way. My only criticism of the film would be its ending. For some reason, I felt too rushed, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than the plot.
