I watched this movie without knowing anything about it and found it similarly thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a problematic parent / child relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father through the mines and dreams of a better life away from his hometown. Both children face the derision of their classmates and both have a strong female model who teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I found among the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern performs a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well, as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, very different from his other features like Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
