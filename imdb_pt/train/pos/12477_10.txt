My family and I have watched this movie frequently over the years. It is clean, healthy, moving and comforting. Showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles away and the most mysterious coincidences, it is almost as if the hand of God had to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 years Jodelle Micah Ferland, who plays Desi, the afflicted little girl, does a magnificent job on her part, and for me she was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> In short, a 10 out of 10. There are no disadvantages to this sweet human story. Children of all ages will cry and joyfully watch this and will bring the family that watches it with smiles and good feelings.
