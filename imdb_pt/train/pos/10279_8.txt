Rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling bad about her profession, feeling it is useless to help her patients. A young gambling addict asks her to help him repay his debts if he really wants to help him improve. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal more of the plot would ruin a hell of a fun movie and 'House of Games' may very well be the best con movie I've ever seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this jewel full of vulgar dialogues, great one-liners and enough twists to keep him guessing until the end. Crouse is perfect as the tense psychiatrist who needs a change and Mantegna spearheads her as the devilishly cunning swindler. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in full control of its audience; and we are loving con. out of ****
