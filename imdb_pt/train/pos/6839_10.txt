In what must be one of the bloodiest movies of all time, a transvestite is killing people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma has some Hitchcock influence with camera angles and stuff. Michael Caine plays a very thought-provoking character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a rich woman bored with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing this, you may never know who to trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
