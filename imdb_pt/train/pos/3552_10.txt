I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I'm repeating something that has already been published, but I feel it's worth remembering the people of Damon Runyon's everlain genius. Without the wonderfully street, hilarious writings of Damon Runyon this movie would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics dealing with gamblers and the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newsman, and he was from Colorado but he certainly made the East Coast street scene. If you are not a dedicated fan of the old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend some other films from Damon Runyon's writings; "the Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker," both feature Bob Hope, who, in addition to his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a West Coast liberal, I find his politics pretty funny too!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
