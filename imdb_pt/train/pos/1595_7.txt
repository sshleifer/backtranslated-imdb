While I would say that I like the show, I expected something completely different from when I first saw 'What I like about you' I expected to find something like 'All That' (I'm not sure if it's happening any more) I have to say that I like the show and while I do not classify it as an innovative show, it's very charming and I like the chemistry between the characters too (including the supporting cast) <br /> <I would definitely say it's great see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really loved him in the City Guy. I also saw the woman who plays Valerie's friend in Popular and while I think it was a good show, I do not really like her character in this show because she's not just my cup of tea but she completes very well
