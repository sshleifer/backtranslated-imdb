Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress from her father's underground bar in a small, tiny mining town. He also sells it to men. She escapes to New York and literally sleeps until she reaches the top. <br /> <br /> Originally, I had only seen the 71-minute version, but it's pretty radical - for its time. Nowadays it's very tame. The movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendos - some of them seem so silly (but fun) today. It moves so quickly that you can easily ignore that most could never happen - even in 1933. There's nothing classic or monumental about it - it's just a quick and fun little movie that is so much fun. It only collapses in the end with a small "moral" end that the censors demanded. He's unbelievable and stupid (I saw it in a theater and the audience laughed - a guy said rightly, "no way") I just saw the uncut 75-minute version that has a different, somewhat tragic, and VERY MUCH better end. This version was thought to be lost until 2004, when it was discovered by mistake! I believe this is the only one in launch - but be aware. <br /> <br /> The performance is good - Stanwyck jumps into his role and throws him up and down. She makes you believe she likes to be cruel and sleep around. There are also strong supporting performances from Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a preppy John Wayne in a little hilarious as a tame and light office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give this a 9.
