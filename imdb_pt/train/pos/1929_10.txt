I recently had the pleasure of watching The Big Bad Swim at the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that it is the best movie I have ever seen all year and that the only movie I have ever felt inspired to write a review / review on. This film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogues, excellent acting and an inspirational message. Common lives come together in an adult swimming lesson and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. This is poignantly illustrated by the first minute images of this captivating film, in which we see only the legs and torso of individuals of various shapes and sizes entering a pool of water. This film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes that hold their attention and imagination.
