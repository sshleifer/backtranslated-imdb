I must say that this film gave me a double personality. I was told repeatedly to shut up and start talking like a normal person. But, it's very difficult ... no, not the wang. Did you find it disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get in the mood for much more. This movie is simply filthy! It's not a movie to show your grandparents, but you should show it to a teen or an immature guy at your place of work. Anyway, back to the mannerisms of the voice. Fortunately, this site has some Ladies Man (someone in the studio noticed that there should be an apostrophe (?) Between the e and the s?) So you can always have something good to say to your boss or the police. I have a sheet in my wallet.
