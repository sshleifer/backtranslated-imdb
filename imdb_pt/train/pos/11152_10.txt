Watching Midnight Cowboy is like doing a masterclass in acting / direction / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and I only saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it has absolutely passed the test of time, and I have watched it several times since. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is brilliant, by the poignant performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this film well, I still find myself recovering every time Voight shows one of his innocent looks, or Hoffman coughs in the his sickly and ominous way) to dazzling cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to take the risk of making films as visually and auditively interesting as this. The midnight cowboy should be seen in every movie school. <br /> <br /> 10/10
