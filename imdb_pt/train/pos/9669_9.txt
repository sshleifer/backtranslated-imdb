After reading the original piece, I thought it would have been a lot harder to adapt to the screen than it ended up being. Donal McCann does a great performance as Gar Public, the repressed antagonist who manifests himself openly on the screen for his extrovert (but not seen for others) extrovert - Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "screwballs", whose inability to communicate their feelings is matched only by Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth rent if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside of Ireland and UK)
