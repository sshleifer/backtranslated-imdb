I'm not much of an expert on acting or other details of the film, but this movie hit me deeply. I do not think I'll forget that. One scene especially (I think anyone who has seen the movie will know which one I am talking about) is imprinted on my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched the similar movie Lilja 4 - ever (as mentioned by a previous commenter). It was also very touching, but not so straight-forward and brutal. If you are sensitive to everyone, or will bring tears to your eyes, but Sunshine Angels can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing subject, but I think, no, I HOPE the movie will get you more attention. <br /> <br /> More people need to see this movie !!!!!!
