Winchester '73 was the movie that moved Mann from the B movies to the big league, rescuing James Stewart's difficult postwar career by casting him as a conflicting hero (though since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves the credit for that). Both men would go to darker places - Mann with the remarkably dark Devil's Doorway, which remained shelved by MGM until Broken Arrow's success convinced them to release it ?? but a movie about a man hunting his own brother while the title rifle is passed from person to person along the trail before he finishes in one of the beloved shootings in the mountains of the director is still meat stronger than you would expect from the system system . Great dialogue, an impressive support cast? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay Flippen C., Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? and Mann's excellent visual sense raises the bar with this.
