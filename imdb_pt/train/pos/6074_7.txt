Laurence Fishburne is a great actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the great Shakespeare, like Olivier and Welles; and he still suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, steals the show. Olivier recognized this potential in his production and released to Iago someone he knew he could obfuscate. I barely realized the possibilities of Iago, the most evil character of Shakespeare, but Branagh shows us the depths. It's nice to see the sights of Venice too.
