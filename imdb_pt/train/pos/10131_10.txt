In the first episode of Friends, which aired September 22, 1994, "The One Where Monica Gets a Roommate" there is a song playing as Rachel sits in the window at the end of the show, the line she plays is: "If you already have to hold ".... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song? It's like great music ... I'd love to have a copy of it. Thank you for your help. I'm looking for the album / cd that's on so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have the shows that are available for purchase and enjoy this show again and again. It seemed to be believable ... thanks for the hours of entertainment you've provided over the years.
