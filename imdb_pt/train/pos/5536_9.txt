I really enjoyed this show. Even as a young man, I was interested in all sports and this included horse racing. It would always be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record the footage on this controversial subject. One episode I particularly remember centered around a horse expected to win a big race that seemed a bit out of color. A syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought he had been drugged, but nothing showed up at the blood tests. All late they realized that the horse had not been doped but had his knee cartilage removed. How to drive a car without oil and the engine disturbing, the horse broke with tragic consequences.
