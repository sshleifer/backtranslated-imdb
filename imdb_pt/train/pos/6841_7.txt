This is probably one of the best known films of Brian De Palma, but it is not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and this film is a takeoff of Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking about having an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, refuses an offer, Dickinson finds a man in an art gallery and ends up sleeping with him. After this point, you'd better not know what happens, but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a program girl who takes a look at the killer. Dennis Franz is the case detective who does not really trust Allen and has to find the killer himself. It's a very good movie, but it's not one of De Palma's best.
