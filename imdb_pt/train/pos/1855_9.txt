Not having seen all the films released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say it's the best movie I've seen all year. Most American films featuring black people are obsessed with American preoccupation with "race relations," or fall into the clich√©s of the periphery ghetto, with every stereotype imaginable spouting ebony phrases . Antwone Fisher is proudly alone in this respect: race is irrelevant, except for a fight that may or may not have been triggered by a racial offense. <br /> <br /> The story of Antwone Fisher is one that must resonate with any empathic individual. He is underestimated and thoughtful, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to make the film, stays in the background most of the time, and allows the film to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> In a time when BET and popular culture in general want to keep the target of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film that speaks to humanity in all of we. I just hope the non-black audience goes to see this film for this humanity instead of avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie that they can identify with. That would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America itself. <br /> <br />
