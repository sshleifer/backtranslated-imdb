Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death." He is a killer of his surrogate father, John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly chief of the Irish Mafia. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses what his father does for a living and both are out on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and the other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mafiosos. Filmed beautifully taking the drama of life in the 30's. Sometimes the pace slows, but an explosion of explicit violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and bonding of a reserved man and his young son. Other notable cast members include Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again proves to be excellent in a memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
