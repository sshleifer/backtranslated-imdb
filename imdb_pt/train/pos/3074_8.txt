Recently, I came across this little gem of a cable movie. It caught me by surprise, although I should have expected the team involved with this movie. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this film with a safe hand and shows. One always wonders about the secret life of the murderers. One does not have to go very far to realize that they are probably neighbors, or social acquaintances, or even friends; they are not different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son, and even to his grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex, is a man who lives in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and is suddenly realizing the consequence of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. Going to Dr. Parks, he's trying to find absolution, though he can not find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turnaround when Alex finds out who should kill next. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, hypnotizes us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe that he is that man. One of the best things about the film is the late John Ritter. He is just as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, how grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her key role of Sarah. It shows incredible capacity and range. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the wife suffering, and she can not do much. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman, is a delight in the movie. He shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
