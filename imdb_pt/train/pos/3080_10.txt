I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, it may be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life! Just go to the official website and the rest is quite simple. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is exciting visualization! I'm surprised that my favorite show ended after just one set. Why is that? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV shows out there! Until I heard they were stopping from a friend, it never occurred to me that this could happen.
