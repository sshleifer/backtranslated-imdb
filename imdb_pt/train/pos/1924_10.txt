This show was great, it was not just for kids that I thought at first, it's for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mainly about father caring is two daughters and son, he unfortunately passed away in season 2, I could believe when I heard. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed they kept up with the show like that would really happen in real life and I need to mention the episode Goodbye It was so well done, it must be so hard for them to film this, you could say that they were real tears in their eyes. I am a 24 year old man and this episode made me cry as I know how they felt when my father died when I was 13 years old as well as Roy. <br /> <br /> 2nd and 3rd season had a great comedy there too the 3rd season had some of my favorites like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it was over, it was one of the best was not the best family comedy show since Home Improvement and could have been the next Friends . <br /> <br /> He should never have finished, but still love watching the replays every day.
