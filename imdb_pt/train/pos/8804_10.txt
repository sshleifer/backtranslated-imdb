Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I found only the Egyptian disappointing). Strangely, everyone, except the Mexican director, chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9/11: Afghan refugees, deaf, Palestinians, Srebrenica widows, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochet's coup and the bloodbath. , suicide bombings in Israel, paranoid and persecuted Muslim Americans in the US, elderly living alone, and the aftermath of World War II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This can say something sad about the limits of empathy in both directions: Directors may feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies while effectively doing the same with their short films. I found the play by Sean Penn one of the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also think that his interpretation of Ernest Borgnine as a man half wacky vegetating in an apartment of New York experiencing the happiest moment of his widow's life when the sun shines through his window after the WTC "fell out of the reach of light", I think this may also be one of the most offended that the general American public would see .
