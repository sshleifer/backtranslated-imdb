This film is a perfect example of a film that divides people into two groups. Those who understand the joke and those who do not. People often attack what they do not understand. This movie has a humorous style and charm that has been unparalleled ever since. It's a great comedy .. and a great novel. It's a perfect date film. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good and carefree laugh. And if your prospect is very tense, maybe this movie is not for you, and you may need advice. It is an injustice that Paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 1980s, having never seen the light of day on DVD. However, they feel that an urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it odd that my two favorite romantic comedies of all time have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's "Great Lover of the World," in which Fox has also sits since the early 1980s. However, "From Justin To Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to beat this will appreciate "From Justin To Kelly", I'm sure one is showered enough for them to "get". Sometimes, with age, people lose their sense of humor ... Or, sometimes, it just ends and they find comical satisfaction in the reruns of "Full House".
