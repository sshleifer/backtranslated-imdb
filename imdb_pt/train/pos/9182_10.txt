Those who love the book Jane Eyre like me (it's my all time favorite, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a little too good to be Mr. Rochester, but in addition, he does a wonderful job portraying the master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may have been a little too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the ages of the characters. The dialogue of the film is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very clever. Of course, this movie may seem a little long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I wish the people who made this movie were involved in the new Zeferelli. version, as it would have helped this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping Up Appearances, and also played Mrs. Musgrove in Persuasion, 1995 (another wonderful adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I got the DVD this week, and it's wonderful to see the original unedited version. There's a lot more at the beginning (Jane Young in Gateshead and Lowood.) And in the end, they've restored many things, (I've always wondered why St. John had a piece of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is-- the part in which he rips from his painting was edited from the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in it ... she was completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I could tell, they had not edited any part of Timothy Dalton, so nothing new there, but it's great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all those years enjoying the VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... maybe with some interviews with the stars ... or do a show)
