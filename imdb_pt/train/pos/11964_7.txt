I went to the movies this afternoon expecting to be disappointed with Scoop. Fortunately, the film surpassed expectations, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep-and not anywhere as good as any number of Allen's true masterpieces-but it's also completely enjoyable as a light and fun comedy. There is something simple and sweet about it. "Fluffy" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they left after the show. It does not look like Allen started creating a work of art here, it seems he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to everything Hollywood is producing, Allen's stuff tends to delight. Even cute things. Nowadays it is simply refreshing to go to a movie made by a real human being.
