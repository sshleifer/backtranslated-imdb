An excellent representation of one of the most damaging aspects of this era. I loved the look - very appropriate for a story attached to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was great at it, he got on very well as someone who has been hardened by his work (which he did not completely choose for himself), but still wants to have a normal life for his family. He does his best to see it happen. Do not want to ruin the plot - but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more of a movie than the usual shoot 'em up gangster / action format. (It's violent though.)
