I liked this movie, and after watching it, made me wonder how many 'Caitlin Rose' there are in the world. How many other girls were subjected to this kind of sexual abuse, and torment by classmates and they were too scared to open their mouths about it? How threatening and cruel the teenagers can be with each other, because as this movie demonstrates, whoever is right is not important, it is popular and feared that it manipulates the minds of young people and influences them to allow this kind of immorality to happen. Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is compelling as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved, and his best friend. This is the kind of movie that does not have the exposure. deserve. Wonderful, and brilliant, too good to be just a movie made for TV.
