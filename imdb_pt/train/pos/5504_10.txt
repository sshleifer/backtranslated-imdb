I just saw it last night, it was aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It was recently screened (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as many others. It's a pretty remarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chávez himself. Instead, they met directly in the middle of the events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they point to), but they stay in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, the history, and the story that leads to the coup. As a film, it is not innovative in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I believe that this is how it should be. What we can see that 'embedded' journalism should be. What we can see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chávez) who truly cares for his people ... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media combine to lead a coup by a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
