This movie is a sort of Carrie meets Heavy Metal. It's about a guy from the school who gets picked on a lot and he takes full revenge with the help of a Heavy Metal ghost. it's a classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have live Metal legends in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must have for metal fans.
