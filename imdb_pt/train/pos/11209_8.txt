Buddy is a fun family film set in a time when "humanizing" animals, and making them cute, was an acceptable way to get people interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows great love that the main characters have for the animals and for each other, and that they will do anything for each other. <br /> <br /> Although not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite real most of the time. The chaos that takes place indoors is usually fun for kids. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have the opportunity to address the error of bringing wildlife into the house as pets, but shows the difficulties. <br /> A recommended film that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
