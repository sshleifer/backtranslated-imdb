I loved it, but I still have nightmares about the hotel manager. The movie was presented well, with the choice of actors carrying their roles to the reality of the writing. Many scenes took hold of the imagination and created a nail bite. The progression of situations was cleverly written, making me believe that history was just a way to find a new turn in what I thought was the obvious. Too bad there have to be commercials. I have told many friends to attend other exhibits and of course I will see again. I liked the scene of the movie and felt it added to the plot and intrigue. Husband and wife heated discussions (or should I say fights?) Were very realistic. The initial situation is common, but the climb to the story presented, fortunately, is not. I want to thank everyone who was involved in this great entertainment film. Thank you! Looking forward to the next movies --- when? Whidbey
