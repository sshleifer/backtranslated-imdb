An ultramodern house in a wealthy neighborhood seems to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that's what the character of Lara Flynn Boyle, Kennedy, states. After a series of deadly occurrences in a gigantic house next door, Col knows something has to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also acts as the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House on the Side works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the locals (lovely house) and elegant surroundings. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely gorgeous. It brings credibility to the character and makes the movie intriguing. Without it, it would have failed. "It's so alive," a potential buyer says in reference to the house. Yes, he's alive. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> The presence of Barring Boyle is not happening much here, since a huge amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I enjoyed it anyway. Cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on behalf of Boyle, the premise of an ultra-modern house of evil, local and cinematography, and set decoration and wardrobe.
