This film exhibits ingenious cinematic techniques in which, instead of the landscape capturing the camera's attention, are small details of how someone appears, how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. As the husband may be wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable. How provocative the woman is is another feature of the picture that the director chooses to inform us that she is a sexually free spirit and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling . The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is open, in which she retains nothing, feels no particular shame for how she behaved, and wants to share these facts with him, because her main focus is always on the fact of her marriage. Nothing and nobody can stay between the two. Only the chances of fate can intervene - his arrest during the war and what follows after his return, finally. A very intriguing film that is totally absorbing.
