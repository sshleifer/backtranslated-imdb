Ya That's what I think. Of course it was still a great show with John, but I personally think it's a lot better off. <br /> <br /> I love having CJ and Grandpa living in the house because they are so funny together. <BR> When John was still around I did not really laugh as much as I did right now. <br /> <br /> It's a shame they're not being made anymore. (I do not think ...) because I would love to see some new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. Rory almost always stays out. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ??? Honestly this is a great show and for anyone who has never watched you should go and watch. I almost guarantee you'll laugh. well until I laugh.
