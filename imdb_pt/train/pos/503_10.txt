After 7 years watching that awful nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I was feeling pretty numb. Next Gen and DS9 were very good things and Voyager ruined TV Trek. This opened with probably the best pilot for a Trek show. The crew was very good as well as the choice of actors for the parties. Scott Bakula played a typical captain for the first time in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change for the captains already known before. The rest of the team was very friendly in their roles and I think they had a good first season. When the show was canceled prematurely I was very disappointed. In a mirror Darkly showed us what the cast was capable of. Too bad a movie or TV movie was never considered. So much history back and foundation of the federation left to tell, including the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
