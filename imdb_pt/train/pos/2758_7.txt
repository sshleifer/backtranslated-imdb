This movie is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The development of the character in this movie is excellent. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who wants the love and affection of "normal" society. Acting is excellent, and the prize for best actor in Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film highlight the fact that Georges has suffered the abandonment of his family and his desire to be treated as a normal. person. Music that is played over and over again also reinforces this message. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are good-natured. We are treating them with discrimination and neglect, a fact that is highlighted by the scene in which Georges presents the waitress in the kitchen). If we can understand and share the world of these people, we as well as the mentally handicapped can become very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so involved with the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. It's a touching movie for good-natured souls.
