Fantastic documentary of 1924. This geography of the early 20th century of present-day Iraq was powerful. Look at that and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before making his ten commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created the Cinerama, an idea that probably erupted while filming the remarkable landscapes of this film. Werner Herzog's fans will find this film a treasure, with painful stories of struggle, complemented by the land around them, the human capacity to bear has never been so evident. The fact that this was done when it was shows not only the will of the subjects, but the filmmakers themselves.
