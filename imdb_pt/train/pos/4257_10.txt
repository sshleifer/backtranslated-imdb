This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great! <br /> <br /> It is not an idealistic film, I would say it shows the life as it is or it was in the 60's and 70's when the main story happens. The characters are cool, but they also have some "dark" sides, which makes you believe they are real people. Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
