Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a bit generous, but for what this movie is, I think the directors did a good job with what they had available, this is also a movie a movie of an acquired taste! <br /> <br /> My immediate thought was the direct connection with the classic cult movie 'The Thing', ie the alien parasites from outer space, infesting the human host to then wreak havoc whenever possible ! <br /> <br /> You can see how this movie honors such a movie and others of the horror / gore genre, however cleverly it maintains its own originality, well these things fight against each other for one and then continue to eat the your fallen rival! Just killing and picking a human when he needs a new host! Then choose another fight with another infected host! And this movie even brings a love story, but I will not say anything else, otherwise it reveals a lot. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But as I said of an acquired taste, then do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It's low budget but rather bloodthirsty, with creatures / aliens / things turning their limbs into gross-looking weapons, meaning saws, drills, blades and even the odd weapon to all but decimate the opponent. I found myself curled into what was being shown, but at the same time glued to the screen asking what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like blood, you like aliens, you like to fight and maybe even a little love thrown somewhere, so I must recommend this movie as a must see. I just want to come across this before I did!
