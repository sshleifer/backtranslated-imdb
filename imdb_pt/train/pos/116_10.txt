Dude, oh man ... I've stupidly procrastinated (not the right term, there's a long list!) To watch this movie and finally had the chance to do so. And "novelties" are: Wonderful labyrinthine spectacle! For any "follower" of Von Trier: both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc ... Europe is probably the differential for its visual greatness . Everything is beautifully gloomy and claustrophobic! You really have the feeling of being inside that "imaginary" nightmare time. Aside from the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, to the late 40s acid-fast avant-garde films, Von Trier leads the art scene as the "all-purpose" filmmaker of today. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complex issues, without being irrational, strikes the viewer's nerve with the intention of healing some of the deeper wounds we feed into our hypocritical world. As utopian as it seems I believe that people like von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader sense. The day when movies and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer needed as a tool for reflection, it may be the beginning of a new era: "The era of emotional control over our fears." This is what he constantly offers us through his work several times. Bravo!
