I am very sorry that this charming and capricious movie (which I first saw shortly after it was released in the early '50s) has had such a bad reception recently. In my opinion, it has been greatly underestimated - but perhaps it appeals more to the European sense of humor than to (for example) the American: perhaps we in Europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more, since we are closer to some them in real life! A special mention should be made of limited but good music - especially the captivating and memorable song "It's a Good Night, Good", which was released separately on a 78rpm HMV (10 inch plum label, I think!) Record In the fifties . I ask all those interested to try if you have the chance: you can have a pleasant surprise.
