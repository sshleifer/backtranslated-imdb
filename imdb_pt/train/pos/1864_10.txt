I just saw Antwone Fisher at BRAVO. What an incredible and incredible young film. This movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and neglect as an adult. Denzel Washington does an excellent performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex Alert - Feel good and tearful. The most touching moment is when he finally meets his mother, from whom he was taken at 2 months of age. And one of the bravest was when he faced his adoptive mother and sister abusive. I saw this movie at Bravo in 2008 and I only wish I had known that years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
