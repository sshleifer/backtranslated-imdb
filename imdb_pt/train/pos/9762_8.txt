This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about William's work knows he's a bit unbalanced (if not ingenious), but this one takes the cake. <br /> <br /> He presents two unfortunate ragdolls who have to save their new French doll from its owner a lascivious. pirate toy and are at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. The strength in this film lies mainly in its aesthetic quality; his strange character designs, his powerful animation and his strong contrast between sweet and scary. Williams's brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real, loose and accurate cloth dolls, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made them more compelling (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines in bringing us the Camels-with-the-wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, chasing the silent film with Sir Leonard Looney and of course Greedy. <br /> <br /> The Greedy animation, by itself, is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation I have ever seen. There is something in that animation that makes your jaw drop - and every second is something new. Living in what was considered "the Taffy Pit", the greedy is a massive blob man who lives and pitifully eats candy. He sings a song that I can not help but feel some sexual tones, then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for his sweet heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are many songs. He continually stalls the rhythm of the film because there are sixteen of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the ones), including "I look, and what do I see?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (although they do not have to sing twice) "I never have enough," "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home." The others seem unnecessary and, frankly, they are not so surprising to hear. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie with strange touches, but if that's what you're looking for, you will not find it any better.
