One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I've seen anything like that for a long time on the network or cable television. Watching this show was like breathing in some fresh air in the midst of a TV program full of reality shows and tedious reruns. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in crying and demoting the show. But when half an hour is over (by the way, thank you, NBC, for running a free commercial show), I got the feeling of instant love, love at first sight, the true love that feels in your gut. Everything about this show screamed EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> Charts in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. No small feat considering those films took years to develop. <br /> <br /> The cast was wonderful. I'm partial to the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team was certainly on the same level as John. Special mention: the appearance of Lisa Kudrow. She was at the top of the game, creating a neurotic, plump and kind panda with a Jewish trait in it. <br /> <br /> The script was funny, with many inner and adult jokes that were sharp but not cheesy. A note to all parents: this is not for children. This program was never advertised as such and there is a reason why it is set for 9pm, not 8am. So if you want to complain about the "questionable context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and that's the father of pride. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a bit confused by the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel "stereotypical" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are extravagant. Yes, they speak with a German accent. But this is the news from yesterday. Give us something new, something new, something funny. Putting the old jokes into a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this program wanted to use the "star power" these guys have. That's okay with me. But please do not dwell on something that everyone already knows by heart. Hopefully, the rest of the show will no longer play the same old record. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is definitely a Must-See-TV. Funny, witty, with some unexpected twists here and there - there has not been such a good comedy since Seinfeld. I'm certainly looking forward to the next episode.
