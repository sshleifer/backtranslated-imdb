I bought it, "The Feast of All Saints", and it's not really a horrible movie, but many things could have been better. It had a lot of historical value, represented by very talented actors / actresses, and it is not an everyday occurrence that actors can play such a role and have some credibility. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I would not say the whole movie was horrible. Once you think about it, capturing New Orleans in the 1800s, and doing something from it, it's very difficult, and much harder to get actors who can strongly mean those parts. But the only big problem I had with the film was that most of the actors who made people of free color were mostly light-skinned Africans, not very universal in conjuring up people who were not light-skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Whoever cast the cast could have chosen a larger variety when it came to hue, although many Creoles are aware of the color. How to choose actors who looked white in a sense could have been more thought. The actors did a great job, the script could have written better, and overall I thought the performances were very convincing.
