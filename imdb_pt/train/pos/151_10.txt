The film is designed to affect the audience and this movie has left me speechless. Gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialogue approaching poetry the film involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the final credits. The story is overwhelming. It brings the public from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human debris left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are excellently launched and give a true sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, landscapes and cinematography are wonderful. I absolutely love photography.
