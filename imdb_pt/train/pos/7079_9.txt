I really liked that - I'ma big fan of movies that mess up your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always. Let's forget Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, shall we?). I particularly enjoyed the way you handled the theme of time travel. and the avoidance of paradoxes - the way the events of the past and the future intertwined and intertwined. <br /> <br /> It was also very well done aesthetically - the art direction was really great, and I wish I had been able to see it on the big screen. The scenes of the future seemed very similar to Brazil, and even the current scenes were often visually appealing. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most striking thing about it has been the participation of two actors that I usually do not like very much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both have made incredible performances here. Especially Pitt - I had seen one or two movies before it made me realize that he could actually act (contrary to what I originally thought), but this one actually got over it. I actually found myself asking my friends at one point "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though he admits he may not be saying much).
