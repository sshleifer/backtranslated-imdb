Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) is launching his epic about the Russian revolution and hires an old ex-Czarist general (Emil Jannings) to play the film general, and both revive the drama and memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> No matter how hard I try, I find it difficult to warm up the 'Last Commandment' for all its virtues. 'The Docks of New York' was undoubtedly a great movie, and 'Underworld' is a movie I've always wanted to see, but 'The Last Command' is quite heavy. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really does make the script come to life, except in Hollywood-defined sequences, portraying the line-up of extras and the machinations of a major film production with cutting-edge technology. Emil Jannings is predictably a wonderful Russian general, marvelously distinguishing between the old traumatized and decrepit ex-general, paralyzed in his misery, and the vigorous and strong officer of yore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ending is great and worth the wait but to get there you should be prepared to be a bit bored sometimes.
