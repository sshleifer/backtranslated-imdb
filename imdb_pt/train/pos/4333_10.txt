I saw this in preview - great films - wonderful characterizations - witty and clever dialogues - were fantastic - Peter Falk will perform for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - the photograph was wonderful Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie, and he gave an account vivid about the making of the film - it had been a long dream of him to write a semi-autobiographical account of parent-child relationships, and more specifically between him and his father - this was accomplished in a dramatic and entertaining way. fashion, the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a family feeling, I recommend this film to anyone who is looking forward to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
