The story of "A Woman From Nowhere" is quite simple and quite adapted from an Eastwood Spaghetti Western: A mysterious stranger walks into a lawless city run by a kingpin and starts firing on the spot. Even the opening credits and music have this touch of spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful woman (!), Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) in a Harley, and the location is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this actioner, there is a fair amount of shootings, some good ones, some predictable, and a few other things, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko deals with his weapons with credibility and resourcefulness and gives the bad guys the due. It was not much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. She shows her acting skills much more like Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi." <br /> <br /> I recommend that the film be a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I am lovingly) and / or a "girls with guns", a movie fan who can endure repeated views. For me, there is something eminently and inexplicably attractive about "girls with guns" movies like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And having a gorgeous girl like Ryoko starring is also just a bunch of icing on the cake.
