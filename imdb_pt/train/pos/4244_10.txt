This movie has escaped the fissures of movie history. It's far better than some other New York movies from the same era, such as "The French Connection" or "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3." There is a brave reality for this film that also effectively manages humor to promote the plot. It is enveloping from beginning to end and is not stained with age as is the case with the two examples above. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman transforms into a bravura performance like "Batman" and it's a shame his career does not decay as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs, and as it comes after Shaft, it seems, at first, a strange choice. However, it is the other side of this previous effort and has approached with the same in its machismo face. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie was not available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really have a piece of jewelery in their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it.
