Kurt Russell is so believable and action so non-stop that we need to think about it later to realize that there were important themes of honesty for goodness [overcoming the fear of the Stranger, learning to overcome the initial conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] into the plot. This is very rare for a 'one-man action movie' that even I [who think most A / A is violent dad] liked the movie and recommended it to every guy I know ..... it's a It's a pity that this movie has been forgotten because, by law, it should have been one of the biggest action and adventure box office hits - it has something for everyone, without overwhelming credulity or losing moments of action almost uninterrupted. I am afraid that the answer to not become a success lies in the fact that the adults did not go to see it. Anyone under 20 probably not only saw more violent action in their video games, but probably would not pick up the multi-layered and multi-themed beauty or did not care about it. This movie can convert anyone who avoids A / A as senseless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents or sees it on a cable TV list] to see this movie, he'll be much more likely to take her to go with him to other action movies.
