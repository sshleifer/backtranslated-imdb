What a delightful film ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by the exuberant, emotive and dreamy music of Oscar-winning composer RACHEL PORTMAN, this film remains a delight worth seeing more than once a year. <br /> <br /> Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was mesmerizing to watch, lying on the edge of someone's seat hanging on every word of her and laughing hysterically at her. One of the most captivating characters I've ever met. From one of the opening scenes, when she's thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending "that lovely porcupine back room ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" She screams in her laughter and clearly hearing poor Mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law) who seems abandoned and lost. <br /> <br /> The comical manners that Emma would avoid the annoying Miss. Bates. Getting ready for a truly harrowing scene at the picnic, when Emma insults Ms. Bates, who takes his cruel dig to the heart. Then we see poor Miss Bates babbling and on the verge of tears and so crushed that we can not help but feel her heart plucked from it in her favor. It's a classic scene, one to be rewound and played over and over ... <br /> <br /> The ending is up there with "Sense & Sensibility" and provides one of life's greatest lessons on how to marry better friend of someone ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will enchant you as much as I do. <br /> <br /> I LOVED IT!
