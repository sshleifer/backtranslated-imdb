I saw this movie by luck, just because I was going through a phase where I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank God I did! This movie has stayed with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls embarking on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were just trying to vacation together before going to college. but their trip turned out to be a much more complicated story. The struggle they face when they are arrested in Thailand and become prisoners is very touching and intense. The acting is incredible, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so sure for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful. In fact, I can not find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch. I know some people do not like it as much as I do from the rating the movie has, but I swear, this one, you have to see !!! I promise it will stay with you!
