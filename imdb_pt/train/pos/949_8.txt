"Telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a timely shooting schedule, which is why this film always tends to counteract the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott incorporates Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, fully covering all his cold tendencies, and still makes him a sympathetic character. The production value for this film was exceptional, never relying on boffo special effects or studio settings, but relying on the depth and clarity of on-site photos and strong scenarios. A movie that surely is alone.
