FULL OF SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> This is a very quick and enjoyable thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) plotting the murder of wealthy wife (Cannon) to get the property. and insurance. The plot succeeded, but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a real murder game - with only minor changes in the details. Reeve allows Easthampton, Long Island, to become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for example. The rest of the plot of the play is a dead offer and to tell the truth Reeve does not mind a bit of gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon's seemingly accidental death. This will increase revenues and your own Warhol quotient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the megabucks-producing playwright whose last four productions have been bombed and who would like nothing more than quietly to get back to work on a new game, perhaps with Reeve's entry, which would rescue his reputation . He can not allow Reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced. So, what else? - He tries to kill you. In the end, they end up killing each other, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she earns a million dollars by selling to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for a number. of reasons. One is the production design. That multi-storey multi-storey house, with the large windmill at the top, nestled on nine of the world's most valuable acres (Easthampton!), Would be a splendid collection of excavations anywhere. You would not be able to buy a tent of puppies in Easthamptom. The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor. It is simply magnificently modest, although it is somewhat tidy to my taste, the kind of house that is so clean you are afraid to step on the thick rug for fear of leaving the mark of a foot. <br /> <br /> the performance could hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are excellent. Dyan Cannon gives a perfect performance as the anxious wife whose pants are so tight they seem to have been sprayed, which is fine given their goods. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his affable but psychopathic killer role. Irene Worth, like the psychic neighbor Helga, was somewhat difficult to define, a mistake. Granted she - or someone like her - was needed for the plot, but, my God, what an offense to snoop around her character, turning around and claiming, "I feel pain in zoom woom!" I suppose, to make it a little more interesting, she gets up in her sweatpants and has a cap with bicycle reflexes. Still, it's a nuisance from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You have to love Ira Levin's voracious dialogue. The disturbed Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the play to say it all. "Because it's there, Sidney!" says Reeve, and Caine shouts, "That's MOUNTAINS, DO NOT BRING! The parts are not there until some hole writes them!" Great is also Caine's call to the police after his wife falls dead scared as planned. He makes a rush of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and begs for an ambulance to be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face takes on his usual placid expression, he blows his nose in his handkerchief and walks away, talking again. <br /> <br /> The climax, although ironic, is confusing, noisy and full. of fireworks, missing the perverse spell that Levin and Lumet brought to the previous scenes. The score consists mainly of cheerful riffs on the stud, fitting perfectly into the film. <br /> <br /> You'll probably like it.
