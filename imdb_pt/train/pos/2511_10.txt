I went looking for this movie in the typical fan obsession. I just wanted to take a look. I was not expecting much. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? It is not possible that so many talents reside in a person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The plot and the characters are not lost in the typical Hollywood special effects. The story rips your emotions and pulls you together. As the credits pass, you suddenly realize that you have stuck to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the acting seems a little overdone. I, however, believe it is done with comic and very appropriate character intent. Otherwise, I would not have expected the level of performance witnessed. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or panting unexpectedly because of something I missed or forgot the first time or two around. <br /> <br /> I completely recommend this movie. Feel free to come in with your questions, but I'm sure you'll find a place on your shelf.
