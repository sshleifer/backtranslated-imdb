THE PERVERTED GUIDE TO THE CINEMA (2007) **** If Loving Cinema makes me a pervert, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then I'm sure you do not get tired of movies about filming and I do not necessarily mean what the dry documentary knows and then. I mean a total speech about the movie viewing experience. Well, if that's the case, I have a lulu from a movie experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (Ralph & Joseph's sister, if you were wondering) noted the cinema philosopher cum Slavoj Zizek giving his film review with some impressive (and often scandalous) assumes everything from the was Chaplin's silent through the modern age of the Wachowski brothers analyzing, probing, and pontificating on the psychosexual, socioeconomic, political, and, of course, the indefinable magic of the movie going through experience with its haunting, determined, and almost frantic dissertations. To explain how the house of The Bates in PSYCHO is in fact the mirrored psyche of Norman Bates in conflict with each level as his Ego, Superego and Id is one thing, but to suggest the same thing about each Brother Marx in just one beat is a remarkable test of faith that overcomes the skeptical layman. <br /> <br /> Although I had no idea who Zizek was ?? does it resemble a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese? with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host appears like a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek into several clips of the movie clips, creating a humorous tone, but still lets the delirious comments continue in full swing, pausing for the discussion in three acts covering the range of films by Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> Is there something for everyone and if a man can provoke a discussion or at least a reason to discuss the themes of a movie? even if they are Freudians / Jungians to a fault ?? so I say this collection of movie theory is worth watching. Look now, if you can, before the homemade video; is the only way to appreciate it.
