My rating refers to the first 4 stations of the SG-1 Stargate, which are wonderfully new, creative and addictive. When the cast went through the gate, you never knew what was on the other side! Starting around Season 5, the show had a different focus - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and an alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "Stargate." The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been turned into great science fiction films. What happens next has always been unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the program are also well defined and brilliantly executed. His tone is serious, but the dialogue blossoms with incredible wit and wit. They are simply fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Beginning somewhere near Season 5, the series began to evolve into an ongoing plot based on fighting with a single enemy (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (much more political / strategic) and interdependent. The characters were still as big as ever, but the show was different in nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that must be mentioned is watching the episodes that celebrated the 100th and 200th episodes. They are simply must-see concerts. They exhibit the creative and madly humorous genius that carried the series for 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a science fiction fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be hooked. If you like to evolve story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.
