This superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at home in the story that was apparently provided by Billy Wilder. We would like to know more about how much he had to do with it, because it is an exceptionally clever variation of the tale of masterful / fertile servants - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry, commanded by dryheads, but transformed into a vibrant world of art and play through a subclass exploited from anyone and non-WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, TV and film in the US, it's hard not to see the underlying insights of this movie as prophetic.
