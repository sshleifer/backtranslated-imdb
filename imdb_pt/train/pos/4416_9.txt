Harvey Keital's best performance till now the new century. Very well photographed, a beautiful snapshot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It's really about the moment a kid wakes up to the fact that the small circle of people he knows really lives in a much larger and much more complex world that he still does not understand. The script is strong and full of humor, the direction is clear. Above all, a really professional work that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to shoot in sync English rather than Spanish, probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this just makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond that, you will find a sincere journey to another world. Recommended.
