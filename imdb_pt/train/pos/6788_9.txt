The story and the characters were some of the best I have ever seen. the graphics were good for the PS and the scenes and narrations were amazing. I won the game at least 3 times and I loved every second of it. I felt that the problems faced by the protagonist were believable and realistic and I believe that it deserves a continuation. or at least a remake. If they had remade it for the ps3 I would buy the system just for that game and maybe its amazing also the idea and the execution of the dragons system is enough to guarantee a rent and, moreover, the inventive, although sometimes cheat wand ) Combat addition system and plot make this game a definitive purchase.
