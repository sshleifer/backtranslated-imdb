The Lion King series is easily the coronation of Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece of cel animation. King Lion II: Simba's Pride is by far the best direct sequel to video that Disney, or any studio, has made for an animated feature film. It deserved a theatrical release. The same can be said for this movie. It has the original cast, Elton John songs, a hilarious story, thrilling action and touching moments. Everything you expect from this series. It's not so much a new story, but a filler and an extended story about Timon and Pumba and their place in this story. What struck me most was the care in the animation. All to often, Disney shorts in the quality of animation of their video and television efforts. But here, they perfectly blend new animations with footage from the original film. The scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are at their peak as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly reprise their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala, respectively. We even received a return visit from Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas. There are lots of laughs in this movie. So, if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
