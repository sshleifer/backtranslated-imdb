I bought this game on eBay after hearing that it was a game similar to Elite. The gameplay is actually very similar and is very addictive. Once I played it a few times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too ... I played this game to the end and the storyline makes it look like you're really in a movie, it's brilliant. If you have trouble exploring freely because of the restrictive nature of the in-game storyline for a player, simply set up a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to do and the software is included) and play the contents of your heart. There are still a large number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is no problem and it's not as threatening because you do not often mean other players unless you want to. So grab a copy of this game, learn this by playing the single-player campaign, then build an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is impressive, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially how you can get it for a couple of pounds on eBay. Take one with the full manual, if you can (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), is much better!
