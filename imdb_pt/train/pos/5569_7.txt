Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) was the second film to star in the duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The lovely burned smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building looking for ways to gain more smoke and lie in bed all day. But Cheech is the "responsible". He has a job and a stable girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to go crazy, so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem arises also, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech is another role) is in the city and wants to stay with him. Firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech Chong out and Red Chong. On what kind of Chong and Red adventures will they enter? Will Cheech get his freak? How long will Chong go without smoke? Just watch the next CHEECH & CHONG movie to find out !! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong takes over the reigning directing realms. He got some experience when he did some work without credits at UP IN SMOKE. Funny, but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans will like it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
