I'm a big fan of a Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for small children because it's good, Cinderella and great for adults and teenagers because it's funny and not over the top. I watched it when I was little and I still watch it now. There are great lines that my family and I quote all the time. The performance is great and never gets old. If you like fairy tales and novels, you will love it. I watched a lot of Cinderella movies in my time and this is the best of them all. (Excuse Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all Faerie Tale Theater shows. All appeal to all ages and are all unique and very fun.
