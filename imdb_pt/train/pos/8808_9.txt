First of all I have to give it to the people who got this thing together. September 11 is such a delicate issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial takes a lot of courage. It's a pity, though not surprising, that the film was banned in the US. <br /> <br /> That said, I think the film is superb with some weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment, reminiscent of the work of Majid Majidi (the absolutely beautiful "sons of heaven" and "the color of paradise"). Much like these two films, the clip shows what happened to the innocent eyes of a class of Afghan refugees in Iran. Clip absolutely beautiful. The same goes for the clip of Sean Penn, which is great too. But just as some of the clips are beautiful, others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzales Iñárritu makes the Mexican clip and, like his "Amores Perros", he does it as brutal as possible. Most of the clip is a black screen with various sounds playing in the background. These sounds are from the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes, those who called home from the burning towers and left messages to their families, those who were angry ... and it combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers. A very difficult clip to watch and one that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips can become very difficult to watch for Americans, since some of the clips may be interpreted as "you're not the only ones who are suffering." In particular, the Egyptian and British clips not only say that, but turn the table and tell how much suffering the US has caused to other people. <br /> <br /> I will also make a special mention of the clips from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the latter may seem terribly out of place, in fact it is not). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great and I make a special mention in the Israel clip which, in my opinion, is extremely weak. While the idea was good (a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story is bogged down because of what happened in New York is something that many of us who live in warring countries can relate to) it's terrible. The clip ends up being just an entertainment reporter trying to get a bit of broadcast time at any cost, a guy saying he's a witness and hoping to go to the TV, and soldiers and paramedics shouting "why". The clip fails to capture any drama from such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, then you should, that is, unless you are a conservative. It's best to stay out, because you might be offended. But if you are not, then you can learn how many of us outside the US lived on September 11.
