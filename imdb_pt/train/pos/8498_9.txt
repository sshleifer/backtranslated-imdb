This is a wonderful film with a fun and clever story and the dynamics of cultural differences and the current theme of what is important in life make this film a very underrated film. Do not let the world's cynics keep you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder with the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton make humor for the serious parts tremendously easy. Great movie around!
