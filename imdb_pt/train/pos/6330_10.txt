This film (and yes, it's a film - it was filmed as a two-parter, but the two parts together come to little more than 2 hours) is one of the masterpieces of world cinema. A very well-mannered and at the same time utterly savage denunciation of the Soviet regime and the kind of person who flourished under it, the film is a faithful adaptation of the book of the same name banned by Mikhail Bulgakov. The sets are flawless, and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochromatic sepia, adding a sense of authenticity where an incarnation of faded colors from the late '80s would have ruined the film. I will not say much about the plot, which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself, but the performances are real Oscar material; special mentions go to E. Evstigneev, who plays the old teacher with such presence, seriousness and wisdom that with just a word or a gesture, he ends up stealing all the scenes in which he is. The second, of course, is Creature / Sharikov. , who played for the gruesome perfection of V. Tolokonnikov, is by far a more frightening character than Hannibal Lecter, because not only does he exist in real life - whole countries have been ruled by men like him throughout history, with all that is Follow. <br /> <br /> Although it is a socio-political allegory, it is worth mentioning that the film also overflows with humor, although it is bleak - there are many comedies that did not make me laugh as much as this movie. Moreover, by laughing at this film, the feeling is not just hilarity, but understanding and agreement, which is always an advantage. <br /> <br /> There is not a complaint I have with this film - the only one. <br /> <br /> A small flaw is the tone of intellectual / bourgeois snobbery that I sometimes took from the "enlightened" characters. But this is a small complaint. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie seems to have been circumvented by western licensing companies. It is a shame that one of the best films of all time is languishing without being restored and untranslated (which should not be incredibly difficult - although all cultural references and revolutionary terminology necessarily disappear in translation, the main themes of the film must be accessible to all). As we wait with our fingers crossed for the Criterion edition, I am thinking of creating English subtitles. You'll see how this works.
