There is no denying that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. Then we follow the lives of the villagers in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and we push away the black market dealers who soon realize that, being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own streets because the government has decided to close the border, we see them retaliate against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food in their position for what is right. In fact, getting worse than before, it all started, that's where morality comes in. That's when they lose all the food they think they are beaten and ask for surrender, just to get all of London to respond to their situation. sending food, much of it. Thus allowing them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This movie is the right note, the acting is superb, featuring Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It's quite simple, not very sentimental, and the moral of the story is not forced down your throat. Worth to see
