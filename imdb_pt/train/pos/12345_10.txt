Kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing its part as part of the larger tale. It's touching, funny and intriguing everywhere. The development of the character is almost perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story draws you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "madmen of the Samurai" and those obsessed with the late 18th and 19th century dynasties of Japan may dismiss this film as the best work of Kurosawa. Maybe it's not your best, but even at its worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is so based on raising the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change, which is timeless, despite being in the not so distant past. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend this to any movie fan, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
