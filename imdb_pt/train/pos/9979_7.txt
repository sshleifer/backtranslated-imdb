To begin with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating should already be reduced. Since this version stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, this helps. <br /> <br /> Is not it like the United States government to terrorize one of its own citizens? It sounds like Jason Priestley's character in the movie! But the truth is, the government would do anything to destroy a man's life by trying to get home to his wife. A wife who is not in labor and can not survive. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country where the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." The words of Disc Jockey. <br /> <br /> There were some great scene scenes in this movie, and great car chases and lots of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this film a 7.
