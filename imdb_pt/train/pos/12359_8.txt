Remarkable because of its notoriously explicit scene, when the beautiful Maruschka Detmers takes the penis of her young lover from his pants and into his mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a splendid ride, albeit a little disturbing, passionate and incredibly sexy. Detmers does a great performance as the insane delight, partially unbalanced, wandering through his naked plan. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me the last two get a little lost and the end is more confusing when her fianc√© is released while other terrorists are released, she seems uncertain about who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in her exams than anything else while she cries, beautifully clear!
