Of the three remakes of W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this is the best, not particularly because what John Cromwell brought to the film. The film is worth it because of the performance of Bette Davis, who, like Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry that she was a star. Finally, his struggles with Jack Warner and his studio were rewarded. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. From the beginning, we realize that Mildred does not care about Philip and never will. She does not hide her contempt for this gentle soul who fell in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated by Mildred again, and again, since she has no idea what she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, in addition to being deficient, is a weak man. When he tries to cling to Mildred, she rejects him. It is when Mildred returns to him, when she is fragile and defeated, that he rises to the occasion, overcoming his own dependence on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic picture of Mildred. This was one of her best roles and she ran away with it. His dislike of the Philip type is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells him that she washes her mouth after he kisses her it is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard underestimated Philip and made him seem even weaker than him. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, are seen in smaller roles. <br /> <br /> This is the Bette Davis show, and do not forget that!
