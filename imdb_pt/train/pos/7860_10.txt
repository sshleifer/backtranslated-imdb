I had never seen a silent film until July 24, 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) hypnotic, so consider the source as you read it. I started watching Tess of the Storm Country at TCM just to see who was Mary Pickford, who was credited by many for the Hollywood release. I had no idea what I was doing. Two hours later, I left and realized that I had seen one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, playing a perfectly fitting role. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, never having seen someone so beautiful and so expressive before. You would have to see her again and again. The setting was perfect for such an expressive girl. She was a poor invader, she could not speak English, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... time to start my collection of Mary Pickford movies!
