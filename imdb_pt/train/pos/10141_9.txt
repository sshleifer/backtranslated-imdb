I was all set to follow this episode, seeing that this 'Master' really does not have any horror movies on his resume ... but this is easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The performance was good !! I do not know how he got it, but we have some real talent in this episode! And while you could see things coming a mile away, wisely, at least it was fun and managed to keep me in command for 56 minutes, something that has been missing so far. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the little in the end, not a twist to say, but just a little bit funny, where he becomes, as always, the pecked chicken husband. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As I said in other reviews - these are not real masters doing many of these episodes ... but they may one day end up being masters in the future.
