* First, while many say it's the worst of the series, I do not think this is true considering that this ideally reflects the teenage mentality of the 21st century. It brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager . moments in which you would like to have the same fun as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it's a teen movie, but comedy movies these days should not be for teenagers? ... cinemas are, for the most part, the place for teens to leave; Also, watching a movie like that during a pajama party or something is pretty good to have a good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comment on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's get real ... does not this reflect the thoughts of teenage boys like those in the movie? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? this is not at all what would be in the minds of those teenagers ... To conclude, I think if you're a teenager you should absolutely see the movie, and even if you're a man adult or a woman, you should see if you still have a teenage mind or you think about what it was like to be a teenager, or things like that. Thanks for reading!
