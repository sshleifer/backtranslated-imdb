BSG is one of my favorite TV shows. I was lucky enough to start watching it when the series hit the final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and it was an amazing trip! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu I knew exactly what I was for just by the title - Caprica! While some things do not stack up when you compare the two series, it still works well. There was no mention of the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I have not gone far enough into the series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and you will want to watch more!
