I do not usually be a musical lover, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This movie is so well done, the characters are well represented, the costumes are good and the songs are good are great, my favorite is' Reviewing the Situation sung by Ron Moody, who does a brilliant portrait of Fagin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60's, but my sisters were, so for weeks on end I had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, it was usually 'Who's going to buy my wonderful roses? So I already knew all the songs before watching the movie. It's a timeless musical that you definitely could not redo, it's not correct for the book and I do not think it would have worked so well if it had been. I do not think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, for he wrote Oliver to describe poverty in London. orphanages, houses of work and what the poor have had to resort to to survive, and the film portrays is very good. Also another great reason to watch this movie is Bullseye the Old English Bull Terrier type, notice his long legs and thin, this was created out of breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like it, and it is exactly as an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times. Note that he has scars (which is probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes probably used it for the dog's fight or for the rat's pit.Terrier had a record amount of deaths in a mouse lair.He's a cute dog and he realizes that he disobeys Bill Sykes after he killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards, is not the head of the piece that Bill Sykes thought he was. A great musical to watch, if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try anything, there is something for everyone in this movie.
