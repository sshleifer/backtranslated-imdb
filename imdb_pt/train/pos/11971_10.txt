I think the comments on the show being tacky are a little overdone. When a person comes to watch a TV show, what does he seek? It is to enjoy that he attends a spectacle, unless he is critical or a person who analyzes the story. But most of us are not like that and watching the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal spectacle to watch after a heavy day at the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, not a royal family, and there is nothing wrong with representing a hypothetical family on television. The simple fact that the show could last so long shows us that people liked to watch it, whatever the comments later. <br /> <br /> Another interesting point of the program is that anyone of any age would not only enjoy watching, but would take back a child's message, although that message is. Jesse's conversations with Michelle are extremely touching if we do not think of it as childish. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that after attending all the shows at Full House, there is a contentment in your heart that rarely comes after many other shows.
