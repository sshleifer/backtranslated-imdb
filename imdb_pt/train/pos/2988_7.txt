The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are very sickly sweet and the movie itself is too outdated to be enjoyed today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, a freelance, independent spinster who becomes pregnant and refuses the help of her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or his friend (John Goodman in an understated performance). She creates her daughter Jenny so sweetly from Trini Alvarado and comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and finally makes a decision that transforms life. Throughout the film, there are many laughs, tears and memorable moments mainly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars as Jenny's future stepmother, who despite being rich, turns out to be a very good influence on her. Whether you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with a lot of excitement, you'll enjoy Bette Midler's version of STELLA.
