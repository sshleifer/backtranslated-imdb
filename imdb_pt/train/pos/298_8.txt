New York has never looked so good! And no one in this movie. Although the script is a little light, you can not help but like this movie or any of the characters it contains. You almost wish that such people really existed. The appeal of the actors is what really sets this aside (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and Dorothy Stratten are particularly good.) Go ahead and rent or buy this movie that you'll be glad you did.
