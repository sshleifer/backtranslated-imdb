This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at its highest point. He avoids the soft melancholy of "All That Heaven Allows" and the tearful sentimentality of "Imitation of Life," and instead goes into feverish anguish and overheated tension. And of course, everything is captured in vibrant Technicolor. The story of cornball has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that becomes a rivalry when Hudson captures the affections of Lauren Bacall, but who is really paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her splendid performance as Stack's sister, who takes over the family business when no one else will. One highlight of the movie comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frenzied dance in his bedroom, unable to withstand the restrictions placed on her by middle-class property. As so often happens in Sirk's films, the scene is involuntarily hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moves in its efficacy. Sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into art, satisfying the Philistines. and high eyebrows at the same time within the same films. His was a unique talent and I do not know if there is another filmmaker like him since. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
