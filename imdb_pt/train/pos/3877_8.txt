Being from Canada, I can not say if this film is original in the context of Danish cinema - unfortunately, we here, we can not see many Danish films in a year! I also can not comment on Clausen's performance in the context of his other roles - I personally found him quite believable - a touching monstrosity of a man, this Jorgen! As for the actor who played Kenneth - why his participation in a TV show dismissed him as an actor - are not we about these elitist attitudes? International viewers who are unaware of their participation in Big Brother will find him a just actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the flaws of the film (writing might have been more subtle in some cases), I subscribe to what might be called the "message" of the film - that is, the essential role of art in life everyday life, art as a healing force. Art, as Nietzsche said, sanctifies the lie ('Kunst heiligt die Luege') - it is a sacred lie: the wedding scene is fabulous in that sense - a theatrical marriage, not religious, celebrating love and life as a joke .. .
