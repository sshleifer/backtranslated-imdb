Richard Willaims is a god of animation. He was barred from directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film, with a very complicated story, but some surprising moments of animation (like "Greedy", by Emery Hawkins). The repetitive music of Joe Raposo also does not help. It was done on wide screen, so the VHS does not show it in all its glory, let's expect a letterboxed DVD someday. Still worth watching some stunning animations.
