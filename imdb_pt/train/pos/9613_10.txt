It's hard to describe Bug in words, it's one of those movies that really need to be understood. It follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I've seen lately in a Hollywood release. Because your characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and because events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer. The almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity of the script, will leave it glued to the screen, waiting eagerly to see how everything unfolds in the end. And as far as the thematic elements are concerned ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to brilliance and beauty, and then to tragedy, all in the space of about a minute. It works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. That reminds us why the independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more Bug quality movies, people will start to notice.
