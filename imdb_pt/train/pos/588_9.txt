I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and I appreciated his love for the American people and for the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford exhibits the lyrical romanticism and visual splendor of the high Montana Rockies as if he were a 19th century landscape painter from the Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt laia. This film makes love with the look and the word with the text of the author Norman Maclean and the impressive work of camera of Phillippe Rousselot (The Kiss of Serpente, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> The Redford cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother and their children, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems that everyone faces . growing teenage children and, later, complex young people. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love for fly fishing and between them will unite them forever. It is the relationships between men, parents and children, siblings, and their women to the outside world that ground The River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is lacking in so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these special relationships, however, is the attention Redford gives to language as spoken in the dialogue. This is a learned script, beautiful to listen to and unforgettable when combined with the impressive rivers and mountains of Montana. The words and setting are the same as the performances of a cast that goes up to the material. Although the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange device to focus a story on, it is not as implausible in the hands of Redford's management. Given the material, the ode of Redford for a time and a simpler life is worth revisiting again and again.
