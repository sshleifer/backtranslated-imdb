This is an extremely dense, somber and complicated film that unfolds very slowly, revealing excruciating details, such as the attention given in a novel, and watching this movie "It's" like watching a novel unfold. While I did not care for the narrator, as I felt he was unbalanced with the rest of the performances, this movie features some of the best performances I have ever seen, and the protagonist, Summer Phoenix, is fabulous. Their innocence and ingenuity, some may find implausible, a kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this review, but it's still fabulous, partly because it's unlike anything I've seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so unique about this movie is how it never shows what you would expect. It is always surprising and despite the duration, the film never reveals more than it needs. At 163 minutes, it is extremely concise, to a fault, I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. It's full of brief moments that are simply stunning, some of the best you'll probably see all year long, and all those moments add up to the end of an extraordinary movie experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie has to say about theater has not been seen in movies since Cassavetes' "Opening Night," or perhaps Chaplin's "Limelight." But, believe it or not, this movie is very "less" conventional. I never knew where this movie was going, and now, having seen, it still has multiple possibilities. This is a powerful and incredibly provocative film.
