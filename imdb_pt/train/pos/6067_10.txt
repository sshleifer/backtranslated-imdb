Although I am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, I am ashamed to say that I like it. It is not possible that such a large pile of 80's papers is found outside a Wham! video, so it is definitely worth a viewing (Â£ 0.79 a night at my local store!). Stay tuned for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume, the fact that the "hero" looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and classic lines like the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "We finally found Kor ..." Kor: "Exciting, is not it?" <br /> <br /> Amazing !! I also like the fact that although the video box looks very exciting, with images of a castle surrounded by rough seas and a dangerous hawk. As a bird carrying a handsome hero for safety (among other "interesting and engaging" suggestions of what goes on in the actual movie, none of them actually happen.No, I'm not kidding ... there really is not a sea fury or a ferocious bird , he's just trying to make you interested ... classic in my opinion. This movie earns 10 for pure entertainment value !!
