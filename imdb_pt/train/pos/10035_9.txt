I think James Cameron may be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his films. Anyway, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was all the news and one of the greatest tragedies of all time. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie, but starred two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well for the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is a movie event. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too boring but watch this and you will find out why they can become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain is bad luck, fate, God's hand (no blasphemy intended), or simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Match all of the above and what do you get? Oh yes! We have a love story in a sinking boat. The supporting characters are as follows: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (idk he was so good), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith Hill) Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many more. We also have the current treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is incredible, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end, you may have your eyes dropping silences or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean, and instead finds a drawing of a woman using the said diamond. She calls and tells her story on RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class, and finally the fate of the ship. Everything about history works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an impressive 86%
