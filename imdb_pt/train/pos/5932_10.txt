Best Stephen King movie next to IT, though this is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This has it all: <br /> <br /> -a great cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a special guest from King himself; <br /> <br /> - well-dosed horror in a funny plot; - great use of music, "Sleepwalk" of Saint and Johnny in particular; - adorable characters in a typical setting of King: middle of no village, <br /> <br /> - very humorous. You can not really get scared here because it's so much fun and exaggerated; <br /> <br /> - but really good makeup effects like they do not anymore! <br /> <br /> A rating of 4.5: I did not really understand. When was the last time a horror movie was as fun as this?
