Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two roommates, Pat and Terry. One night she gets into her car and is attacked by a man masked with a knife. Her plan is to rape her, but she can escape. The man has his purse. The police can not help her since the rape did not happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her assailant gets there. His name is Joe. A long battle begins against this man. But then she can spray insect repellent eyes and mouth, things that will kill him if he can not get help soon. She ties him and makes him the subject of the same kind of physical and mental attacks that he ends up with (1986) directed by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial 1982 off-Broadway play by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost her battle with cancer last year, is as good as Marjorie. .James Russo, who played the attacker also in the play, is convincing as Joe.Alfre Woodard and Na Day Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry.James Avery is seen as Security Guard.She has a Golden Globe nomination.This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you. He asks a question is justified revenge. This is not a perfect movie but I recommend it.
