This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire, well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a now gone world, and learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I liked the story, the characters, the acting and the scenes. Some scenes suffered from the fast editing and the subtitles sometimes disappeared very quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character Safiya is beautifully played by Marie Gillain, who I am pleased to say has done a fantastic job without doing this. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and adorable. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world that they are imitating.
