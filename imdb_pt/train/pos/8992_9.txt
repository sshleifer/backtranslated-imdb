A really cool movie. A must for any music snob. You really do not need to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhols. The only thing that is needed is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The Dandy Warhols have a role in the film, as the "rival band," but they are the second BJM violin. The Dandy Warhols do not play as big a role in the movie as I originally imagined, but again, they did not have the element of excitement and unpredictability of BJM. You can not help but be fascinated by the band. and his very charismatic leader, Anton Newcombe. By itself, it's an insightful movie and study about the music industry. Just watch this movie and have fun.
