Finally! A decent British comedy that is not centered around some bank robbers of batons or a TV series. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery, dressed in biker clothes. The three protagonists are silly gentlemen with a fall for failure and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive and emotional trio of sub-plots to sew the rampant comedy together. The chemistry between the three friends is palpable and contributes to a companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comic moments. It seems part of Withnail and I, part of American Werewolf in London, and part Quadraphenia (but only because of cycling gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, the kind rogue Phil Daniels reminds you of Danny, the retailer of Withnail and me, with his academic approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who are already interested in psychoactive substances, which will relate to many moments in the movie. A personal favorite is the bright scene in the Welsh corner shop, buying snacks while tripping over mushrooms. This soft comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and you laugh out loud. And you do not have to ride a bike or even like them for fun. But it will increase if you do. Bright.
