While Rome goes crazy celebrating Hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two foreigners stay at home in a large building and end up meeting. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of a brutal civil servant and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio announcer who was fired because of his homosexuality. Both need companionship and understanding, both to find each other. <br /> <br /> The film covers an interval of a few hours. The colors are faded and everything happens with a soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio announcers. Strangely, the Nazi anthem - the Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful film, excellent re-creation of a special era in Italian history and a moving and sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we hope and Sophia Loren does a superb job, very far from the neapolitan personas of fish-mace. Do not miss it.
