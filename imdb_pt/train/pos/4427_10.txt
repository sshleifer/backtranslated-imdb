Sogo Ishii took the ancient myth of Musashibo Benkei and put it on his head to produce a dark, bloody, fascinating and fantastic-looking film. Those who are not familiar with the legend need not be; the story is well explained over time. It's worth looking for, although there are no home versions in English.
