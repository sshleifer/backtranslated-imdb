Pretty good drama though it did seem to have some blank areas letting viewers fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being like this for someone who can not read or write. This movie simply looked like the real world: the wife who is suddenly the only supporter, the relatives who live together and their quarrels, the disturbed child who gets stuck and then, typically, leaves school, an imbecile husband who accepts nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
