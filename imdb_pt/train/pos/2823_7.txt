MGM did not know how to sell Garbo when it arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in "Torrent" justified that. She did not speak a word of English, so she must have found it difficult to work, and also Ricardo Cortez did not make it much easier for her. <br /> <br /> The torrent of the title is the river Juscar that passes through it. a sleepy little village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes one day that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under the thumb of the mother and can not convince her to marry. Meanwhile Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) expelled Leonora's parents from her home and they send Leonora to Paris hoping to give her a chance to continue her singing career. Leonora sends a note to Raphael, asking him to remember his promise and go with her. His mother is enraged and forbids him to leave - so, of course, he gives in to his request. <br /> <br /> The years go by. Leonora has a new identity - she became La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael finished as his mother wished - he is running for the post and is courting a "safe" young woman, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), who is a heir to the "pig." Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old house, and I agree - because she did not help her mother. His mother is still living in the family home, working as a cleaning lady and doing laundry. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so charmingly handsome, it's hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam is exploding and the torrent is flooding the city. Leonora's house is on the way to the mighty river, but when Rafael tries to rescue her, he realizes she's safe. They then re-ignite their romance. There is a "horizontal" love scene in this film, very similar to "Flesh and the Devil". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull will spread gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora's mother believes her. and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora shortly before she's on tour in America. Once again he intends to go with her, but again he lets her down. He spends a lot of time listening to other people destroy his reputation - "what she will do for you, but it will drag you down." The irony is that she has just secured a job in government for him if he comes with her. They meet again years later - she's as fresh and vibrant as ever - he seems older than his years, bent over by mediocrity. <br /> <br /> It's certainly a good movie with a positive message to follow your heart. Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupid, the barber and faithful and old friend of Leonora. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
