I do not have much to add to my resume, this movie ranks up there with Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made, not trying to be. I at least do not think this should be taken seriously when assisted as it is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I do not think this brings Christopher Walken's reputation as his reputation was in decline at the time. . It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the sleep he had been. As for Michael Ironside, he's been a little funny, although he's not trying to be serious movies. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is incredible is the budget this movie had. The scenes and the actors and explosions, etc, are quite amazing, so obviously someone liked it a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever it is, I like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone reads this by looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt that there are many), know that it is a hilarious movie and that should be seen with a smile on his face!
