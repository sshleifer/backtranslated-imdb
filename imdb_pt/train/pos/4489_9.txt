This movie is not about a cat and mouse fight, as stated in another comment. It's about a cat that used 8 of his 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing his last. The cat is scared and scared all the time, hence the name "dead cat." The previous lives of Fraidy Cat haunt him as ghosts who are from different times and are constantly trying to kill him, but he is more afraid of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the form of a number 9 and spits illumination bolts. very old now, but it would still be fun for the kids if you could get a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
