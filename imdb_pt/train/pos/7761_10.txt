*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and considered quite cheeky at the time, Candy Sirk's colorful melodrama is still a wonderful thing. The plot relates to the events of a dysfunctional Texan oil-rich family that includes older brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very touching and vulneable performance and his sister Marylee played in an extreme way by Dorothy Malone. Malone's performance is telegraphed to us through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which consist mainly of lust (by Rock Hudson) and jealousy (by Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in movies that first enters a room. Now, do not get me wrong, her performance, to say the least, is absolute hissing, and it's one of the top acting jobs of the 1950s. But it's also terrible because, as nice and attractive as Malone is, is not a very good actress, and is not capable of subtle or shaded. His performace is of a note. She manages to do an evil Mambo, and in a big montage, as the loveless father played by the always good Robert Keith falls to death climbing a ladder, Sirk mixes with an almost crazy Malone doing an orgasmic dance as she undresses. Stack (who should have won an Oscar) and Malone (who won the award, but should not) are the true stars of the film, those who define all hysteria, both sexual and moving, while the "Real Stars" of the film, Hudson & Bacall weaken to gray and brown, which are the colors in which they are most costumed. Hudson, who was a better actor, gave credit to plays from childhood and Stack's best friend and love interest to Malone, who moaned and moaned about Rock for most of the film. But Hudson does not want to be a part of it, and instead is in love with Bacall, who is married to Stack. Nobody is very happy and no one is happy for long. Stack-Bacall's marriage falls apart long after a year, and Stack practically dodges because he thinks he's sterile and can not give Baball a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man and had a long and fascinating career in both films and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of intensely colorful "women's films" or melodramas. Although they were adapted primarily from medicore or trashy sources, Sirk's hands became masterpieces of the genre. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he brought to play in these films filling his spaces in full screen with characters who lived their emotional lives between strange combinations of colors and illumination, to create shadows and many reflected reflections. In "Written," the characters are always peering through the windows, listening to doors or sneaking around. So in the end, after much violence, an accidental murder, a miscarriage and more Sirk ends the film with a final and surprising scene of a "reborn" and reformed Malone in a man's suit, sitting at a table hitting a well of miniature oil.
