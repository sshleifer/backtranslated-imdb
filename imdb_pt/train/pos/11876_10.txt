You know when someone looks at this Brian DePalma movie today, I'm sure there's been a lot of criticism about how it's dated. In addition, about violence. When I looked at this movie on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was violent and violent, too. But I did not get that. <br /> <br /> Some decades go by and dude, how do I know how much I did not get this movie !! This is a remake of an excellent film that was made in the 30/40 years. How can you improve a classic? Not you. But you tell a story that is updated by the eyes of the "new immigrants" during the most greedy decade, the most indulgent 80s. DePalma, Stone and his gang feature a good, ambitious, disturbing and accurate film. <br /> <br /> Yes .... Disco was dying and New Wave / Punk was taking over, but these immigrants from Cuba had to do it. a new home in Florida could not tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted, but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida, where they were ... with lots of money and to get the money, you had to take charge of a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana, the "little train that could". What an incredible way to have your main character looking at America: fight, kill, steal. lie, cheat everything to get - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> This is what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted, he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the word "f", but what did you expect, the Emily Post finishing school for him and his classmates? See how they came to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is how Tony and his team decided to "be all they can be in America". It was all about power. Tony Montana would do and do ANYTHING to achieve it ... all his violent glory, lying, hoarse, hoarse and stolen. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that epitomized the '80s for me is money laundering. Tony's crew carrying drug bags to the bank. Do those around Tony and his crew care? In the clubs where he passed and drank? No. Money was money and money, you gain power. Tony was living on top of the pig. He and his handsome American trophy he married played well with Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana's rise to power, he discovers that it's really bad up there. He's full of doubts, he's addicted to drugs, he's paranoid, he's surrounded by those who want to get him into a fucking death, his 80-year-old American drug-addicted wife he finds out he's boring, he needs stay on top of your empire because ... it's going down. And it descends in a horrible and violent way, but again I ask, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is the quintessential 80's movie telling you a distorted story of how some misinterpret the American Dream ... for obsession. It is violent, bloody, excessively ... but it takes the point disturbingly home. Not all the Cubans evicted from Cuba who landed in Florida in the 1980s were similar to Tony Montana. Give me some time. But the demonstration of how miserable the 1980s were, with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measure in America to "be someone" and have power, brought its tool to these poor characters and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> Makes you wonder - has anything ever been - learned today?
