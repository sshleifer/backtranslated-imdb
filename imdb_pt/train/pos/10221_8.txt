Faith and Mortality ... seen through the lenses of an elderly American Jew-Ashkenazist and a young African-American Jew who swings between being in conflict and having frank conversations about how their lives have unfolded over the years. The character of Mostel is a tailor with chronic back problems and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career monger, never taking a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory - he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as he has failed along with his wife's health). but Levine de Belafonte has his own problems, still yearning for the girlfriend he left behind .. Belafonte's character leaves the film before it seems, and then the ending is puzzling, and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending .. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood 'typical' movie about ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith .. worth watching more than once and enjoy the excellent performance of the main actors ..
