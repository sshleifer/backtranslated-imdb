A mess of genres, but it's mostly based on Stephen Chow's mash-ups for his inspiration. There's magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pace is fast, so it is easy to overcome the many flaws in this film. <br /> <br /> A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A beggar takes him to a Shaolin monastery in the middle of a town, along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can not read. The old monk teaches the boy, but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is dominated by a false kung fu master who is assisted by four crazy monks. The new master gets angry with the boy for more than 20 years for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out during the night. The boy is found throwing garbage in a basket from an incredible distance by a man who brings him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a big fight, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. <br /> <br /> Al, this happens in the first 20 minutes, with most happening in the first 10 minutes. In addition to the shorthand narrative, the first problem is how little we know the main character until we get to the movie. The man who uses the boy is best defined when the first third ends. The plot does not follow new paths, except for the climax of the film's insane action. I'm sure you can easily imagine how crazy monks will appear in the end. The effects, photography and stunt work are all first-rate and compensate for the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy and this movie will live in his shadow, but that is not a good reason to ignore it. It's a lot of fun even with a scattered shot end. Recommended.
