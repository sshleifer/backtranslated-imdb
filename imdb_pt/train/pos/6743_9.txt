Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen movies but who has never registered for me. Often impassive, taciturn, playing the same types of roles and looking a bit like the equally underrated Glenn Ford, he is an actor who strives to truly appreciate; but once you hit the right movie .... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's melancholy look on New York's belly is as dirty and decadent as any 50-year-old, and Andrews is in his element as a tough tough cop, Mark Dixon, who does not know how to play to make progress: he hates too many criminals to ever play rules. Early in the movie, he accidentally kills the witness of a murder involving an illegal junk game created by a maverick that Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mafioso to his kind of "justice". Along the way, he became involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to get her father out of the murder. <br /> <br /> Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with harsh and glittering dialogue of Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and grace found in just a minute or two, this is another noir for ages and can being my favorite Preminger movie so far - is as good as the most anticipated Laura.
