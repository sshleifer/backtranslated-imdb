are highlights of this 1917 feature. Clan Pride tells the story of a young woman becoming a clan chief after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, villagers live the simple lives of "fishermen." My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film has a stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this delightful film. Pickford was already a big star in 1917, and this movie seems to have been written just for her: brave young woman succeeds in disgrace. Pickford whip whipping lazy villagers for church is very funny. And the final scenes of the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford movie, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is good as the island boy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I could not locate her either. My copy interweaves many bells and gongs and adds a strange feel when the village's warning bells are touched. Very effective.
