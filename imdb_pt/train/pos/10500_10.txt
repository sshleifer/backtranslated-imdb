Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games of the series, it is still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with a lot of repetition value are few and far between. In addition, this game has lots of variety. There are 15 levels, each with several different tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not take anything away from the game. After you beat him, you'll want to erase the game and start over. And it's so fun the second time, or the third time, or the hundredth time. A must for any Nintendo 64 owner, and it's a reason alone to own a Nintendo 64.
