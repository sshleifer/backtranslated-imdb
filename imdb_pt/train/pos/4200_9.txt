Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: a film "Red Scare," devoid of hysteria, in which the communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin who incites the plot. Porter Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters from her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; without the knowledge of any of them, holds vital secrets for the Cold War. Peters was by chance being watched by FBI agents who are as perplexed by the robbery as the man commanding the cowardly comedian Richard Kiley. In an attempt to recover the precious film, both sides seek the help of Thelma Ritter, an old Jane who is always on the ear and willing to sell what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws from an opulent palette of timing and tonality in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, your Manhattan summer gets a sweaty glow that is almost poignant. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix of tumultuous and compelling, and they are awarded "Again", a song released by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Widmark. The pace slows to Ritter's beautiful death scene - among the most poignant vignettes of all noir and a kind of mirage oasis in a movie parched with sentimentality. This is the only work of writer / director Fuller within the narrower limits of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Kiss, The Underworld) have never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as the Pickup on South Street.
