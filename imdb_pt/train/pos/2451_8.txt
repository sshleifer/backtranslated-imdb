George Lopez is a funny man, even without the sitcom. The first few episodes I saw of this often made jokes at the expense of their mother. As I observed this more, there has been more and more variety. No one in the cast is really safe from your wit now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this season has progressed that George is getting more comfortable with the role of father of the sitcom family. At first he was not, but he is getting more and more in a rhythm. This makes it and the shows progressively funnier. They added a couple of characters for George to play this year as well. The father of his wife is more and more involved in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central as the past seasons. I think it's wise to say with George's sense of comic timing, and the lack of good ABC sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
