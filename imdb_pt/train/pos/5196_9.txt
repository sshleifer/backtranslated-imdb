Human Tornado (1976) is, in many ways, a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work on and heeded the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. It's a fun movie that is more technically sound and acted. The artists do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time everyone is joking and going with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as hard as he was in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie and highly recommend it. Like his first film, it's targeted to a certain audience (I doubt very much that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this point in his career). Check out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
