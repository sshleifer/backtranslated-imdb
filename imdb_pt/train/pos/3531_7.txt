Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir, starring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does, I might add, without much help from his male actors, namely Curtis and Tone. It's Raines all the way, a beautiful, leggy actress who for one reason or another has never attained the status of some of her "noir" colleagues. <br /> <br /> Siodmak use of sex, light, shadows and music is truly remarkable as it addresses this genre. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff from Elisha Cook, stimulated by a lively Raines. It's this scene that brings the "Ghost Lady" to a new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines, who performs a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save his man. Franchot Tone phoned this one. Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he could die and did not seem happy that he lived. And he never, except for a brief moment in jail, seemed to be in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that as World War II progressed, interest in psychiatry deepened. But often the terms were misused in such films as "Possessed," "Spellbound," and "The Greatest Show on Earth." Tom is called a paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder, but he seems to be closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headaches, he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Lady does not have the biggest plot, but it's worth watching.
