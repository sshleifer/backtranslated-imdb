This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it still holds me now that I'm older. I still laugh at all the same old jokes and I can even shed a tear sometimes. I never cared much about animals talking, or at least with animations from the UN, but with the one I defend. It's a very old movie, but it will always have a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no other film about live animals that I can think of the moment I can compare, much less as much as this. I may be giving a lot of praise to this movie, but I do not think it's the show. I really hold this great message that "home is where the heart is." Or at least that's the message I got from it. Definitely recommended for a good family movie night out.
