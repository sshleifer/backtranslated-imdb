I love ghost stories in general, but I particularly love ghost stories in the cool, atmospheric, and elegantly scary period. This one qualifies in all aspects. A young naive lawyer ("solicitor" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the coast to calm down the property of a deceased old woman. It's the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Britons go seaside on holiday to "their health." Well, guess what, there's nothing "healthy" in the village of Crythin Gifford, the scary place of the Victorian's immense and victorious Victorian property, located on the edge of a salty, mist-covered marsh. When the lawyer saves the life of a small girl (none of the inhabitants will help those who are in danger - you find out why later in the movie), he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is not a transparent and transparent ghost, but a solid black silhouette of malice and malice. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. As the camera approaches the lawyer as he reads the legal documents, you expect to see the woman in black at any moment. When the lawyer goes to the generator to turn on the electricity of the scary old house, the camera approaches him and you think she'll show up there too. Waiting for the woman in black to appear is a spicy suspense. We have seen many elements of this story before (the locked room in which no one enters, the fog, the naive ignorant who ignores the warnings of the locals), but the director somehow manages to combine them into a completely new ghost and compelling story. Watch with a friend so you can have someone hot to grab while waiting for the woman in black. . .
