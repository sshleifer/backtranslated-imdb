Okay, needless to say, this movie will only appeal to a certain audience; that is, stoners and people who think like. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you are one of those people mentioned above, this movie is a must. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy to anyone who buys their first bong. What the Holy Grail of Monty Python is for geeks and nerds, so is this movie for the potters. I saw this movie for the first time 10 years ago, and I still shiver every time I watch it. The jokes perfectly ridicule the lifestyle of the potters, far better than the imitations of the last day, like the half-baked attempt to make. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, so to speak; the film is more a collection of several skits; while the protagonists of the films wander through Los Angeles in its legendary haze. Despite this, the film has a great sense of rhythm and does not drag around at all. Many people cite Up In Smoke as the best work of C & C, but I have to say that the next film is superior. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for an hour and a half of laughter, light up, tune in, and let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
