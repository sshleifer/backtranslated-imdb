I do not know if this is a comedy or not, but I agree that this is one of the greatest television shows of all time. It's great that this show is still on the air. And I love Michelle. It's cute in the episodes when she was a baby and she talked, and sometimes she said something funny. A W. <br /> <br /> This show can relate to kids and teens and .. well, families as they struggle through hard times and try to settle this as a family. I do not know who would ever refuse an opportunity to attend this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode when I think her name is DD .. the older girl accidentally stole a sweater, and she learned a lesson about stealing. It was a great episode. An example of this TV show shows the family working as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this program for everyone.
