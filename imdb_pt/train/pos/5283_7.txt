The premise for this film is simple and so is the script: an elderly Muslim takes his teenage son to take him in his truck from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so he can fulfill his holy Muslim obligation before he dies . The father is clearly religious devotee, but the son is not impressed; he accepts by obligation to the father and not to the religion, prefers to be with his girlfriend (non-Muslim). The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although often it is somewhat tiring. However, like any good road movie, there are strange characters encountered along the way; for example, a woman on a backroad in Croatia who, when asked for directions to Belgrade, simply stands in the backseat and points with her hand uttering a word that they suppose to be a place but can not find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another man, they ask for confirmation statements, he can speak French, but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in a country the son gets tired of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they get a goat but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) he flees before the father can perform the ritual of the Muslim massacre. They finally arrive in Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners it's all bizarre, but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated, but it is charming in its own way, a sort of National Geographic with soul.
