"Magic" is not a very strong word for the spell that this film weaves. You see yourself relaxing and watching others in a more benevolent way ... Any movie that has a civilizing effect on viewers deserves serious attention. Rarely are we soaked in beauty like this. As if that were not enough, it's funny. Performances are, without exception, extraordinary, but special mention must be made of the miraculous Miranda Richardson, and the superb Josie Walker - both open as roses. <br /> <br /> Why is not this movie on DVD? You deserve to live forever.
