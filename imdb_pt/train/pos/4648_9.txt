Hilarious, evocative, confusing and brilliant film. Reminds me of L'Age D'Or of Bunuel or Holy Mountain of Jodorowsky - a lot of strange characters looking and searching ... what is it? I laughed almost all the time, all the while keeping a peripheral eye in the perplexed and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience around me in the theater. Entirely fun, from the beginning to the intestines and poisoned bowels to the end, if it were an end. I just wanted to remember all the details. It haunts me sometimes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have only the most positive memories of this movie. Since he does not seem to be available to take home and watch, I suppose I'll have to wait another few years until Crispin Glover comes with me again with his Big Slide Show (and the subsequent "What's This?") I saw this movie in Atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash, so I was a bit stunned at the time, which might be a good state of mind to watch the arthropods talking prophetically and the retarded in the costumes of superheroes and divine Glover in their proper corpulent environment, scantily clad girls sticking out of the ground like a magnificent wet DADA dream. <br /> <br /> Is it a statement about life as we know it? Of course, everyone EXPECTS that art is just that. I prefer to think that truth is most evident in absences and negative space. What you do not tell us is what we should deduce, but it is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day after day. Instead, a "what's this?" of 5000 films like "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shiver, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (additionally a fun man to watch on screen or on his big slide show - clever, funny, quirky and outrageously hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
