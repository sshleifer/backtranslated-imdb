Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie no man has ever done! If you love Bringing Up Baby, Philadelpia history, the skinny man, I was a male war bride or is a wonderful life - films made with intelligence, taste and and the tongue occasionally panting on the cheek, check this. Life after World War II is portrayed simply and idyllically. Grant is at the absolute top of his form by playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a rural squire. Loy is lovely as his wife pre-NOW. The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can not Take It With You and contains a bit of the future of the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art direction and editing are way above par. <br /> <br /> The film never leans to the venal antics of low rent, by numbers, from the later adaptation The Money Pit.
