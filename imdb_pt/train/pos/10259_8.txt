Many people wrongly do not like this series, but several of the Guinea Pig videos are pretty fun. The Devil's Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects - not only the infamous eyeball scene, but also a very realistic slice of skin on the foot and a smashing hand with a sledgehammer are very realistic - especially for vintage and low budget from the video. <br /> <br /> Let me start from the beginning for those who do not know: this movie is an "extreme" torture / snuff movie that appeared in Japan in the mid-1980s. Its plot is simple: a young woman is held by some men and forced to go through a series of brutal tortures to see where her break point is. This implies brutal violence - all effectively realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful application of hot oil on the girl's arm in captivity and placement of larvae on the subsequent squamous wound. <br /> <br /> The less effective sequences are at the beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns to hit the girl while her head falls and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl. and pushing it to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is very convincing in feeling pain and takes a fair amount of abuse and rough things on the camera. Her reactions as she has headphones tied to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are scary. Some of the other abuses she takes are being tied up in a hammock by a tree during the only times she gets a rest. There is also a disturbing scene in which the captors laugh through it and another disgustingly despicable scene where she is turned in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until vomiting. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, I hope I have helped you decide whether or not to give this episode a chance. 8.5 / 10 for the Devil's Experiment.
