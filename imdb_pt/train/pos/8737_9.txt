Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I liked Insect Life more. I can not remember a Pixar animation, besides the two Toy Story movies, that I was laughing so much. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. Voices are what make this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant that gets into trouble. Hopper is an excellent characterization by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as well as Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also the support of Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could continue and continue. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. Antz's social messages are missing, but what we have is a solid entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox
