What a perfect example of "Less is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black-and-white photo, when the eye of your mind has to fill in the blanks, facial expressions, physical drama, emotive gesture, everything combines to make a stronger impact. This is one of the top 5 movies that I can not live without, up there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" starring Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was also in the Soldier. The "Thirteenth Warrior," starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner," starring Harrison Ford.
