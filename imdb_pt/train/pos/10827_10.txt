Still Crazy has been compared to Spinal Tap, since both are comedies about R & R groups. In fact, the resemblance here ends because Still Crazy is much better written and staged while the Spinal Tap deteriorates from the slightly fun 10 minutes into a nonsense that makes Beavis and Butthead look sophisticated by comparison. Still Crazy is stereotyped, but the character's friendliness and the unexpected high quality of some musical numbers have made up for the a priori predictability of the film. People expecting an attempt similar to Spinal Tap in satire would be disappointed by the carefree nature of the film, but I would make a successful and ironic play of Still Crazy because of a pompous, but failed, satire that is Spinal Tap.
