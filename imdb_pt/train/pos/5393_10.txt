I was probably one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when this series aired. I have to say when William McInnes first appeared, he's a low quality actor! But as the series continued he slowed down his performance and I totally loved him. He was such a rotten guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Complete Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers playing a good, quiet man and even more interesting to see Tom Longs' wavy muscles! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the lead actress put on a fun performance. I recommend this program if you like stories with a twist and watching Tom Long walk around with no shirt ...
