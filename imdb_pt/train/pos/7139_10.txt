John Thaw, of the Morse Inspector's fame, plays the old Tom Oakley in this film. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and at the beginning of World War II. A little reclusive, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while serving during World War I. If you can imagine the old and retired Morse inspector twice as crochet as when he was a cop then you have the Tom Oakley character. <br /> <br /> However, this heart of flint is about to melt. London children are evacuated before the blitz. Young William (Willie) Beech is lodged with the protest Tom. Willie is played with good results by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care with the capital C. Behind the school, still wetting the bed, and unable to read are the least of his problems. It comes from a horrible story in London with a mother who can not cope, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Slowly, still, man and boy warms each other. Tom discovers his ability to love and care again. And the boy learns to accept this love and affection. See Tom and Willie building a bomb shelter at the end of the garden. See Willie's delight in what is probably his first Tom's birthday party. <br /> <br /> Do not give the ending, but Willie is adopted by Tom after a lot of fighting, and the two begin a very new life more rich. for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson are following in a long line of films where the man meets the boy and develops a mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captains Courageous." Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face." <br /> <br /> Two points of interest. This is the only appearance of Thaw I know where he sings. Just a verse from a hymn, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Second, the young Robinson also starred in a second film with "Tom" in the title, "Tom's Midnight Garden", which is based on a classic children's novel.
