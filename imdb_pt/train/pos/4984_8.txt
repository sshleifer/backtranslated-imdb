"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps one of my all time favorites. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he would do more campiness like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the CG psychedelic sequence, the parts in which Lord Helumis blows up his failed henchmen, the party riots Bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, Worsle appears. <br /> <br /> Check this out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for sophisticated anime fans!
