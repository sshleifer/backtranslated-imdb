A famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers what looks like a heart attack when he finishes a concert. Suddenly, we watch him when he arrives in the small town he left years ago. Since he left so young, and having his name changed contributes to give him a new person. He bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. It would be expected that a man in his position would have all the comforts of the world that he left to be installed in his new abode, but no, Daniel faces the rigorous winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local pastor, Stig, whose church has a small choir, calls to see if he may interest Daniel in helping, but the conductor has no desire to return to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The people of the city leave you alone. He makes an impression on Lena, who works at the local store where he picks up his food supplies. Little by little, he arrives and decides to get involved with the choir. Lena will eventually fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> At first, the relationship between Daniel and the members of the choir is not exactly what he expected. By getting to know him better, they come to accept you and make you one of them. His new position does not favor him for the woman who used to be in charge. The members of the choir are a heterogeneous team, but they realize the change Daniel made in the way of playing different songs. The new play by Gabriella, a battered wife, has a big impact on her life and that of her fellow singers. <br /> <br /> Daniel's ideas for the repertoire collide with Stig's. The vicar suddenly begins to see Daniel in a new light; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife, Siv. His ideas collide with dogma, as Siv points to it. Stig decides to try to do away with what he considers to be a sick influence of Daniel, dismissing him as the head of the choir. <br /> <br /> The choir, who was invited to participate in a competition, travels to Austria. . Daniel, who has now totally fallen for Lena, has the chance to show for the first time in her life her feelings for her when she begins to have doubts about their relationship. Daniel, who is late for his own concert, begins to listen to them making extraordinary music, although he is not among them. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, the director of this extremely appealing film, shows that he was the man directing him. The story involves the viewer from the beginning. Much of the success of the film goes to the cast that was cast. William Nykvist, who plays the lead role, is the best excuse to watch the film. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk and Ylva Loof do a great job for Mr Pollak. Stefan Nilsson is the composer of most of the beautiful music you hear. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in its beauty.
