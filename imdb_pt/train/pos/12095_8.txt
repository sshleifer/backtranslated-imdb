When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by the British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar bet. Not believing in Poe's claim that all his macabre stories were based on actual experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend a whole night at Blackwood's haunted castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by several beautiful women and handsome men, and a physician of metaphysics - who explains that they are all lost souls condemned to repeat the stories of their deaths in the anniversary of their deaths! The first time I watched this glorious bit of classic horror, I was mesmerized all the time. I found the film genuinely scary and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The soundtrack makes the atmosphere twice as unseemly. The topless scene threw me into a loop, as I did not expect. It seems Synapse has done a great job with image enhancement because this movie looks great for its age, and it's the Uncut International version to begin with. This is the film responsible for starting a collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
