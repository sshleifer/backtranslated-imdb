In the spirit of the classic "The Sting," this movie hits where it really hurts ... in the heart! A primitive and suitable psychiatrist, eager for adventures, finds herself with the dirtiest and most rotten of scoundrels. The vulnerable doctor falls in love with the executioner and begs to get involved in his operation. While the movie moves somewhat "slow", the climax and the ending are awesome! You will especially like how the doctor "forgives"!
