I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was not a dry eye in the house. It's amazing to see not only the great person Darius is, but how admirable the rest of the team is too and so young. <br /> <br /> It also made me think about how disgusting MTV was, and how to get an opportunity to engage and inspire in a positive way, they turned it down. It shows if they really care about the youth and their viewers. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and moving true story ... get your tissues, but it's great to see how today's loving and inspiring youth can be.
