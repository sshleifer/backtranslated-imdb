This was by far the best war documentary ever made. From the beginning of the first episode, when Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane "The day the soldiers arrived." For the final days of the war, when the clouds of mushrooms appeared over Japan, I never lost a second of this classic series and I remember well even though it was exhibited in 1974. Every and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series should be a compulsory vision for as many children as possible in the world so that the tragedy of World War II will not be repeated and that fanaticism, hatred, greed and intolerance will not be confused with patriotism or religious zeal .
