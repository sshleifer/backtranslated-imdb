I found this movie at the local store during the annual sale on their sidewalk. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find some cartoon movies on sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand at work for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a sibling group of three adopted children (and soon to be adopted) living with my family. Immediately my adopted children made a connection with the three children starring in the film. The film helped them to better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, too, the oldest of the sibling group (7 years old / female) decided to open up a little about their past and the trauma they had experienced. She has struggled with the whole issue of trust. This is also the first time I've seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked what it meant for a child to be adopted. She replied, "It means being happy." A must see for families who are promoting children and are considering adoption. It certainly opened the lines of communication with us.
