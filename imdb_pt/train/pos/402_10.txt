I've seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this movie, the scenery takes place in the mountains of China, the Legend of Zu seems another dimension !! Thank you for the extensive use of Tsui Hark's CGI effects. He is able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from sharp blade blades, broken swords and the ultra-cool Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> Although there are many characters in this, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The look of the novel is there, although the film looks much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. At first, I like how she looks like the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very attractive to the eyes? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and their special effects were limited due to their time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes you to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
