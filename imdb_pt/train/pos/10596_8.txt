Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone on the Radio Times says it's a satire against the world of post-war rationing and the welfare state. I do not think that's the purpose of the movie. The film parodies the spivs (small criminals who run the black market) and the housewives league that campaigned against government restrictions but was actually a Conservative Front organization. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course the film sends politics / social. situation, but in the end people realize they need all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be British and confused rather than foreigners. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they're back to exactly what they were before.
