One family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father of Jake Weber, son of Erik Per Sullivan) goes out to a family to get together in some remote home in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. It annoys some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) go awry. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started watching this. Most reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. Well ... I disagree. First, it's not a horror movie. The horror does not even begin until the final 30 minutes. He plays more like a family drama with elements of terror. At that level, it's very good. <br /> <br /> First - the bad things: The pace is too slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor; WAY of many false-dream sequence scares; the evil wendigo figure in the film and the clear vision we have of the wendigo at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> The good things: Very good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as the mother; some great direction with mysterious sound effects that are a bit scary; a very explicit sexual sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for plot integrity!); very good acting by Sullivan (only 10 at the time!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are annoyed with this movie because it's being pushed like a horror movie - it's not. So if you can ignore this, I think you might like it. I'm giving a 7.
