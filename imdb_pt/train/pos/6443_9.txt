Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. Was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago. I've never watched or even noticed it before because it falls (so typically) into the "Swedish Film" category and those who have risen (like me) to Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of any foreign film. Hell, what a paradigm shift! The film touches me because it keeps my hope that humanity can change to a better way. The Swedish village is only a standard for all areas of the Earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... It takes a trigger on the outside to rip off the masks of all (which holds one) and let them feel that we are all just human beings with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this because it keeps my hope as described above. The five minutes that contain the history of Gabriella's music, including her performance, is one of the highlights of the movie of all time! Thank you Kay Pollak just for these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
