Vivah is by no means a classic. However, in the days of hardcore action, groundbreaking special effects and complex tangles (none of which Bollywood has yet dominated), it is quite refreshing to watch a simple movie like Vivah. The story, as we all know, is a journey from the first meeting of a couple to the wedding, after a few instants and moments of testing. Nothing more, nothing less. Music is not as good as MPK or HAHK, but it also does not shake your senses. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaari shaadi were humble. Shahid presents himself with sincerity and shows a lot of potential. It's good to see him play something other than the "cool guy" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile little town girl to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are great supporters and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. The direction of Suraj is simple but effective. The main flaw of the movie is the slow pace that can test the patience of many young viewers. But, after all, a good family movie, clean and decent.
