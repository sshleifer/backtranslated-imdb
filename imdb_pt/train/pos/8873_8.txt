This movie came and went in theaters. Due to the nature, you can see why it was not well received. It was unfairly criticized for its sake more than the film itself. Higher education is not spectacular, but it was a good movie that tried to talk about a feared subject in America: racism. Plot / Story: Higher Learning is mainly centered around Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive lane star who has to deal with not being fast enough, and a stern teacher (played by Laurence Fishburne). He befriends Fudge (Ice Cube) as well as a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (played by Michael Rapaport) is a confused boy who ends up making friends with some local skinheads on campus. Once they impose their opinions on him, he becomes as racist as they are. Higher Learning is not flawed: character development is meager, legal performances by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the skinheads leader (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes does not fit in this movie. Also, women who become gay after being abused by men were clich√©d before this movie, so you know I did not like that part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Other than that, this movie was not kind of bad. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps (even though I could do without the accent), Fudge was the best performance of the Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was good as the messy Remy. All in all, it was one of John Singleton's best films and it's one of the reasons I disapprove of the junk he's putting down now. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and fewer such as Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very useless remake of Shaft.
