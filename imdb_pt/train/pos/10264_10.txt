I just watched the movie for the 3rd time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast as much as before. It just keeps getting better and better. You simply have to marvel at the carefully measured speech mode, the deliberate slow action, all being exactly in place. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the great and definitely my all time favorite !!!
