I saw this movie before joining the British Army. I went through my basic training at the beginning difficult and then as I progressed much easier. My time was spent during the pinnacle of problems in NI and the Cold War. There were times when I wondered what I had gotten myself into, not for long, since training always took over and you would always react instinctively. The narration used to show what the soldiers are thinking is in place, although I added breathing and heartbeat as this seems to hit their ears in certain situations. A few years later, I was in Canada for a family get together. An aunt of mine who lives in the USA and is a professor at Columbus Uni Ohio has done some work on the effects of the British Army on NI. She spent some time there researching. Although ex-pat, she was very anti-British. She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only response was to see the movie "A long day is dying". It's the closest a civilian will realize why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right in the end.
