There are so many reasons why I value both the sopranos, one of their greatest triumphs is the cast and character development. Each character unfolds more and more in each series. In addition, each series has a variety of different 'small time characters' as well as the main one. A good example of a character (which was in only three episodes) you can feel is the compulsive gambler David, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. The show revolves around Mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who tries to balance his life of crime with his role as the father of two children. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with their dialogue and imagination and that is what makes it so believable. While Tony directs things with the capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) looks for a promotion. Each episode also features Tony's other family somehow which includes his sons and wife carmela soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems, his soprano Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can out of Tony's business despite being under house arrest. All the acting is powerful and complex, but the two that stand out most are; James Gandolfini, who is Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, representing the younger generation (20-30) in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, modern TV dramas of such caliber may not have existed, such as The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos are definitely Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction TV
