Since seeing Anchors Aweigh for the first time in 1945, seeing it on videotape contains a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be the first of MGM Technicolor's great musicals. Now I'm perhaps more interested in thinking about the future careers of top players. Although Sinatra made some insignificant movies shortly after her appearance after the days of Dorsey, as a solo singer, this was her first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems to be almost a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard for this, but his dancing with Kelly is credible, and he would do better on his next peers. However, noting his physique, it is easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academic award for acting and would play many roles as a detective or tough-fighting leader. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated this film, his captivating performance did not suggest that he would become a great creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire . Finally, it was strange to see the newly-stared Dean Stockwell and to remember that he would later play an "emotion" assassin in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder of the 1920s. An additional note: One reviewer praised the Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. Later she played in front of him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.
