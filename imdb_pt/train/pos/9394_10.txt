"Red Rock West" was by far one of the best thrillers of the '90s with an excellent screenplay (by John and Rick Dahl) that kept you guessing everywhere and on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a wonderful cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance), making this an exciting and captivating thriller not to be missed. The film has never had much publicity about the release (actually, I get it on TV for the first time) and is therefore one of those little special jewels that you have to look for, but this unique movie is now slowly gaining followers. <Br> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams, who is broke and out of work when he is in the small town of Red Rock. Confused with a hired killer named Lyle from Dallas, he is shocked to receive $ 10,000 to murder the bar owner's wife, Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the plan and decides he should go and tell Brown's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists and surprises - and double trades - that Cage is thrown from one crisis to another . and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation, he can not drag himself out! So, just to complicate things further, the real Lyle appears to perform contract murder (played by everyone's heavyweight favorite, Dennis Hopper). When Hopper finds out what happened, he goes after Cage, but no one can predict the surprising events that follow. Some favorite movie lines: Nicolas Cage (for Lara Flynn) Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt, but it's a lot of money." <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you're going to spend some time with us until we get to the bottom of it." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "Are not you a killer?" Cage: "That's right, no, but the guy I'm supposed to be went to town, so you have to get out of here." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "OK, how are you going to explain the impersonation of a hired killer and get 10,000 dollars from my husband?" <br /> <br /> An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a never-ending plot and powerful acting from all directors. Any movie with J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad that the career of this exceptional actor was tragically interrupted by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for "film noir" was undoubtedly the forties, but "Red Rock West" is a good modern example of the genre . has entered my list of the ten favorite films of all time. I look forward to more like this from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
