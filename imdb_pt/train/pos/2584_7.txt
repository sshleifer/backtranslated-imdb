The film begins very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, an attendant at a photo-collecting station. His wife was restricted to his home with an ankle bracelet as a result of a felony fire sentence. Wallace is a member of the Volunteer Fire Department and takes fire fighting seriously. <br /> <br /> As we watch Wallace's monotonous life, suddenly something new and dissonant comes up: an itinerant carnival comes to town. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> Wallace too. Both are pyrokineticians or "photicists", people capable of starting fires through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Some of their differences date back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a tramp. Wallace avoids using his powers; Wilder wants to go public on national TV. <br /> <br /> Complicating the subject, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, whom they had dated years before. It becomes a bone of contention, and becomes one of the reasons why the brothers finally have a literal gunfight. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun but not funny. I think enough to have a copy in my library. It's a good movie out of the ordinary.
