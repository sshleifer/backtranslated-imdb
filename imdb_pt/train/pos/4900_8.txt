This is a quirky movie that the Brits do so well. Low budget, cameo type papers, well executed. The story is a little weak, a widow recently Judi Dench decides to gather the "bombinhas" of a band of girls (that almost all) that appeared during the war in London. The obligatory son / daughter who thinks she's gone to the bathroom. liked the way the film lets the young people see that they do not have the monopoly of feelings, love and even lust! That the "old wrinkles" can also have good laughs. Judi Dench was superb as always, a shame no I can not see more of the other blonde bombeshells, the ending was a bit rushed, I thought. I kept thinking while watching that David Jason would have made a Patrick even better than Ian Holm, although he was quite suitable as the drummer of "travestis." All in all a merry movie is worth a night with the girls :)
