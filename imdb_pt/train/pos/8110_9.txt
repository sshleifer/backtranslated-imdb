Amazing effects for a movie of this time. A primer on the futility of war and how war becomes a caretaker of itself. <br /> <br /> One wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now in the public domain and is available on archive.org. No cost, no registration required. Watch at once and you will be driven. <br /> <br /> I plan to share this movie with as many people as possible, as I had never heard of it before and I am a fan of science fiction. <I'd like to see how others react to this movie. Watch. <br /> Rate. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
