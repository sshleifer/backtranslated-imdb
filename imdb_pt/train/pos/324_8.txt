I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did. I bought it simply because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look particularly great. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was one of the most skillfully composed films of recent memory. <br /> <br /> This is a twenty year old woman who wants to know everything. It stores all the information it collects in a huge file. She experiences experience in sex, political activism, and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown making the film and we see their reactions to the story and the other. Nudity, explicit sex and political controversy prevented this film from appearing in the US, while its seizure by customs was appealed. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary that shows us the world behind the scenes of the filmmakers during the narrative, the fourth wall being broken. This movie is the most direct way I can make a movie I've ever seen. The film works predominantly as a time capsule of psychedelic events of the 1960s, freedom of combat and sexual liberation. I like to think about it much more than that. <br /> <br /> I do not think I would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I really like it. This movie is a buried treasure. Give it a chance.
