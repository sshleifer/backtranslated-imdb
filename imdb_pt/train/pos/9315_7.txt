Prominent advocate Walter Pidgeon takes a pro bono homicide case, gains an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only to blame but part of an extortion ring reaching the highest echelons of the city. Tormented by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, confronts the identity of the "unknown man" who leads the union and kills him. <br /> <br /> Ironies are involved when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend it by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. Despite a lack of urban interest and a great deal of rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by the recognition of the widespread corruption of American municipal politics that came to the fore in the postwar years.
