Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wise comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally fun. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character very well. The Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice time capsule.
