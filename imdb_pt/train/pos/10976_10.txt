That's why I love this site! I saw this movie in the 80s on British television. Over the years, it's one that I would like to know more about how he stayed with me as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. With just a few key words to remember, I've crawled the movie here, and a lot of information, including the fact that it's about to become an off-Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> Curiously, unlike the previous commentator, I do not remember finding this movie sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter remained in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honor and dignity. Ironic you may think, considering the misery of their lives. Maybe it's because I live in Britain, where decadent grandeur has an established language in the life of old money, where misery is often tolerated as evidence of good creation; I saw him as a rare and unique portrait of enormous spirit, deep and deep humor, whose delicately balanced fragile fabric gave him balance and respect. In a way, I regret to see this being discussed as a "cult." Over the years, as it faded into my mind, the brightest, above all others, shone as a brilliant and extraordinary television experience. It was an exhibition so deeply private, that it seems strange to think of becoming as public as a New York musical. But perhaps somewhere, the daughter will enjoy herself with such a result. Is she the one who will laugh last maybe ... (They did a musical out of it before you Jackie O ')
