This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and we saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. It's rare for me to be completely taken aback by anything but this is possibly the biggest fantasy film I I've seen it, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it's all Neil Gaiman's fault. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialogue that was clever, flowed smoothly and made the characters completely believable. <br /> <br /> I could continue for days on the spectacular acting, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is Brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero almost steals the film as Deeply The Pirate of the Closet Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy brought by the mood that managed to be laughed at by our funny Loud, clever enough to make the first Shrek look like a sitcom from the 80s, and blending perfectly with the rest of the film would only have done this a great movie. <br /> <br /> Special Effects were almost perfect, so this was not SDA or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used, they were exactly what was asked for, not much to distract you from the movie itself and blend seamlessly into history. <br /> <br /> Is it the story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story that contains all the classic components of the fairytale formula that does not fit just like another cheap imitation of the Promised Princess. It manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> <br /> Any of these things would have made this a good movie, all of them combined make it a great movie, but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanted world that these elements combine to give life. Once again Neil Gaiman did this, he pushed another dagger into my heart, creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and charming that I would do almost anything to live on it and would only give me a little glimpse of it. I did not want this to end, I wanted to be sucked in by a vortex into the land of Stormhold and meet personally Tristan and Yvaine, travel through their fields and valleys, stroll through their markets and meet their locals, both dangerous and friendly and stay there to ever. It's a feeling I've noticed every time I've read anything by Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over, I could not see anything else in the worlds that he created, which seemed to be much more vibrant and alive than the one in which I am forced to live and to watch Stardust was no different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure Neil's writing and this movie will not have the same effect at all but believe me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this film, it's easily one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least enjoy it.
