The innovative musical of Rene Clair. If you want to see where the songs first directed a story, this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who thinks he has won the lottery just as his creditors have been calling. Unfortunately his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend's apartment and was given to an escaped convict who then ... oh, but that would be revealing. <br /> <br /> This is a light and sparkling story where much of the dialogue is sung (most people think this has not happened until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movie they do not do anymore, and they rarely did when they did. His sound is a movie from the early days that plays like a movie five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in a way that neither Busby Berkeley was doing (although, to be honest, comparing the two filmmakers is unfair, since Berkeley was essentially doing threaded dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through the "real world") . It's an amazing little movie. and it's a lovely movie that will only make you smile. It's just a cute piece of joy. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's really all you need to know.
