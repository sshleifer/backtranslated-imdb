Good luck in finding this movie to watch - it has not yet been released on tape or DVD. I saw it at the launch in the early '70s, I was lucky enough to get it through the preservation efforts of the American Cinematheque, and still have some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat the rwint precise comments here. As a director shortly after the increasing success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N was said to have achieved the low budget effort in the best possible way, and this certainly shows in the slow and winding rides that could have used some re-cut. But it is also a memorable icon for your time: the very intense clashes of college sports of the late 60's, student movements, sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why see this movie? It was probably a floor break in some scenes: the frisky male bonding in the post-match showers; The Karen Black scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it's the first use of a word I had not seen in the movie before; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity in general. There are probably others I'm omitting. Look for a nice surprise from a young Cindy Williams in one of her early films; a fine David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren took off the sky blue UCLA uniform and prepared for a dark blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - actor; and a lot of people just playing themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: any connection between the surname of Harry Gittes, Robert Towne, and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> Gets a "7" based on Karen Black. You will see why.
