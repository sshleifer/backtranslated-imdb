Other reviewers have summarized this movie well. I just wanted to add to the "Phew!" Tell a reviewer about Elisha Cook's drone episode. This was a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some praise for his frantic performance. <br /> <br /> A bit of trivia I'm guessing: Cook appeared as a waiter in Barbara Stanwyck's 1941 film, "Ball of Fire." He was a waiter in the club where Barbara was singing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa played drums, with more energy. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's ostentatious battery in the later film, "Phantom Lady," was inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook had witnessed three years earlier? <br /> <br /> If you watch Krupa in "Ball of Fire," I think you'll notice some clearly similar body movements. It is hoped, of course, that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time!
