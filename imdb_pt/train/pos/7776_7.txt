Anyone know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack may have been a character from the Masseratti.Rock Hudson told his father that he was taking a job in Iraq, is not that timely? I've had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank for most of my life, maybe this was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall certainly had some hits in this film and probably acted like Malone, but Malones's part made a more sensational impact, so she landed the role of best supporting role in the Oscar. Was Loren's role considered a leading role? Hadley's character was probably a very common image of tycoons of his day when he was a normal guy who did great in an emerging industry but in building an entire city he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them. In time, being a widow, he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten, looking for attention, so instead of trying to relate to his children he blew his head off. A tale of ancient morality. But seriously, what were those sports cars?
