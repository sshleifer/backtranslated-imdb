This great film consists mainly of documentary material currently contained in a DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and storyteller Frank Capra made these films that simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused the Second World War and the rise of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every school-age child, or rather, every American should watch these films. movies today because they are so timely. The story is repeating itself again and again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis to infiltrate countries through sympathizers and then communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to the advantage of this evil group. <br /> <br /> Reclining and leaving Hitler as early as 1935, aggressive - France, America and England caused more than 50 million people deaths. Americans, French and British today would let Hitler do precisely the same thing, despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators violate treaties. <br /> <br /> These great movies may be too simplistic for Buffs in World War II history. They do not tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because then the United States joined them, fighting Hitler. This film tells the simple facts and reasons that led to the terrible war.
