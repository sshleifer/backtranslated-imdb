I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor child faults. Other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun to say the least. The filming scenes are ridiculous, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little too much of his "obsession with the Matrix" for him. It seems your enemies are there ... waiting to be shot. However, this movie is playing and always makes me cry. He's got a good mood, so it makes me laugh too. Gackt is an excellent actor, I must say ... he shows so much emotion. This was the first time Hyde had acted and he did well. The paper fits into it. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT MISS IT! YOU WILL REPENT!
