A sweet and utterly charming film, Shall We Dansu? made me laugh and cry. In the first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not very attractive - a tense employee, apparently dedicated to his family, but easily captivated by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But at the end of the movie, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all dance instructors and dance students. This uncomplicated history of transformation and renovation is a little gem that I would love to see again.
