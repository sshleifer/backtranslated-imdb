I first saw Thief as a child that makes me almost as old as Jinn, I guess. As any child would be, I was charmed by the film's imagination, inventiveness and energy. Several years later, I realized how much satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first performance. I've never had the opportunity to watch it over the years. Besides the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at his best. When you see Thief as a child, you know you had a great time. When you see Thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It is as timeless as the story it is about. An incredible job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
