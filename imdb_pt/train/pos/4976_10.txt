A film by Frank Capra about the movie WONDERS OF LIFE. <br /> <br /> Keeping blood pumping in our veins is the responsibility of HEMO THE MAGNEMI. In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science teamed up with famed Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS television films to educate the public about the Universe around them. Far from the sad black-and-white fodder so often foisted upon young academics, Capra's films instructed and entertained with eye-catching animated visuals shown in Technicolor. The Four Movies - OUR MR. SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO, THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNDECORATED GODDESS (1958) - quickly became favorites of schools where they were infinitely displayed in 16mm format. The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), an affable English professor at the University of Southern California. This avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect movie instructor, generously transmitting to his audience the sometimes complex facts, in a way that never made them appear monotonous or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a Peabody Award for his accomplishments, continued to make high-quality instructional films after the Capra Quartet was completed. <br /> <br /> HEMO The Magnificent, produced, written and directed by Capra, relates human heart story and blood circulation system, using animation and gentle humor. Movie star Richard Carlson appears as the fiction writer, energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production team and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig, as well as various cartoon characters, all without credits. <br /> <br /> The devotional script that begins the film is completely in tune with the tone and tenor of production.
