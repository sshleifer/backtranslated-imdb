I knew I would see it when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the subject of clinging to your dreams speaks to me. People talk about it as a kid movie, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers who are accepting old parents, sick, our own mortality, our kids growing up and leaving us, and all the other things we never think about would happen. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what it means to live your dreams when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths plays a small part as the wife in a thoughtful layered performance. Camera work is slow and sweet. When they put together this film, they left out anything that was not needed. Very enjoyable.
