This is Baby Burlesk's second short to be released, and probably the most popular, is a parody of the 1926 silent movie, What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I've watched this and I do not understand the kiddie-porn that's being claimed. It's just a little cute movie. I saw family shows that I grew up watching in the 80's and 90's that had little girls dressed in a more provocative way, in a mature way. It was more provocative because they were not wearing diapers. There is nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of these fetishes. (just a joke) I read this description of the movie and where it states that only a pedophile would enjoy watching it. This is sick. For me, if you look at this and are bothered by it, you may need to investigate your own mind and try to understand why it bothers you. It's an innocent movie that was made as a parody of another movie. All B.B. movies were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / spoofs are graphical in nature and have almost pornographic scenes and a rather vile language. Should not these be more terrible? I can watch those smoothly, but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into dirt in those parodies. That's what should lie beneath your skin. Not that they have flounced (not a word, I know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how those movies have changed, huh? Not to mention those 'forbidden films of the Hollywood pre-coding era' so vile and filthy. Would they never make such a mess today? (note the sarcasm)
