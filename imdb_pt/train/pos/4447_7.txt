Barbara Stanwyck gives this soap produced by Universal, with Sirk and is directed by Douglas Sirk, the kick you need. Not as memorable as Sirk's latest melodramas, it's easy to see watching "All I Desire," where Sirk would be artistically directing himself for years to come. Stanwyck is a dancer who returns to her family in the small town of the United States after dropping them a decade earlier. Your family and community have conflicting emotions in dealing with your shocking return. Part of the cinematography is incredible, and Stanwyck is tough and gives the film a dose of energy. Overall, a good show.
