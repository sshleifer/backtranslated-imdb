I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorites and one of the most beautiful actors of all time. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of his films, but all of Jeremy Jordan's. The thing I do not like Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" denounces it. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is the Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
