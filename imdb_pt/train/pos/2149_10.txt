Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable. The punctuation is so touching that it has brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without appearing athletic. The graceful dance and the charm of Mai gave me shivers. Tamako is a wonderfully delightful character. You can almost see the haunted schoolgirl on her face as she remembers to see "The King and I". Aoki's character is hilarious and unfortunate. Masako is as irresistibly natural as the confused wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right. <br /> <br /> This movie really is a guardian.
