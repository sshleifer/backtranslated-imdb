A shocking film of four city workers in crisis in the Appalachians has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four entrepreneurs faces their darker fears as they face a challenging rapids trip on a river about to be replaced by a dam. When locals decide to "do what they want" with intruders, this leads to multiple deaths and too much trauma for the survivors. Each of the travelers is excellent, although Voight gives the lead and stronger performance. The countryside and culture are well captured, including the string of breathtaking dueling banjos. We saw it on a date when it left, not exactly the perfect date film (although we both enjoyed it). I kind of remember this as a dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already settled. It's not the kind of movie you can watch every week but it has a strong impact and it's beautifully filmed.
