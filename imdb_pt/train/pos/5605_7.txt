This strangeness of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his concerns were at the time he did it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led to it, to the point of creeping and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The film is haunting to some degree, and has that atmosphere of creepy awe that Polanski surpasses, but this comes out much like a repetition of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other Polanski's best films dealing with the strange events. <br /> <br /> But as for the concern ... unless I'm reading too much in the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at home. being labeled as a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgment about him in one way or another, but it's hard to deny the evidence in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
