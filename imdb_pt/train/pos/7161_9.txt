I loved the movie. We love the two families crossing paths in history. The only question is if Sam is killed, then how does the lineage of his family continue? He is the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero must be related but does not mention any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm Ever mentioning any other son or wife before you speak and fall in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a baby before she became the kisser Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes of the movie. Just loved it. The performance was great. I'm not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a woman at the end, but it makes his character even funnier. The other "counselor" seemed concerned about the children, but of course maybe not so much. Poor Guardian must have had a really stinking childhood for being so mean when she grew up.
