This was the second in the series of 6 classic films of "Tarzan" with Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this was a wonderful film in this series; and perhaps stood out as an "intermediate" film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it was performing well, though not as good as the subsequent films. Similarly, cinematography is less accomplished than Tarzan's later films in this series. The stock I saw was of uneven quality, containing some grainy scenes and some underexposed and overexposed scenes. The clear view of Tarzan's later films is missing here. On the other hand, there is a scene at the very beginning where the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swaying in front while the camera is backing up, showing the savage men advancing through the jungle were actually almost modern in their scene. style, and stands in stark contrast to the stationary jacks that make up the rest of the film. As for the plot, an interesting feature here was the almost inconstancy of Jane when she was being subjected to Martin flertes. The kiss ?? and Jane is stunned and partially guilty, reaction? foreshadows something of Jane that we see in the future also in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Finds a Son! Jane's dubious actions deceiving Tarzan and handing Boy to his family. Later, she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here, nothing so explicit, but we have Jane "returning" to Jane Parker from the past, and in an almost sorry series of actions, taking off the evening dress brought by Martin and Harry to drive her away from Tarzan. There was a whole series of representations and sequences that impressed me especially in this exhibition. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the image we have of Tarzan's domestic life is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll with always the near possibility of violent death. This for me is very much at the heart of Tarzan's experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some pretty violent scenes, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan taking the elephants to the Elephant Valley graveyard; Tarzan being rescued from death by hippopotamus and then breastfed by monkeys; Cheetah will find Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; Cheetah in particular cross the river in the log. The final battle scenes of savages and lions on the ground and wild and monkeys in the trees. Jane, showing us that she is truly from Tarzan's world now, quickly exhibiting her entrepreneurial forest to create a line of fire to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is splendid: Suddenly Tarzan is on the scene, flinging wild from the trees and taking care of the lions, and summoning the elephants to the rescue! That final scream of Tarzan in triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, with a dancing and enchanted Cheetah next to them, is a memorable image and really a good summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone.
