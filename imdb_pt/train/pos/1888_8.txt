"If I wanted to dribble, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Have not you had enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You gave me a choo-choo." <br /> <br /> "If I start dying, please remove (the cowboy hat) from my head. That's not how I want to be remembered." <br /> <br /> Some of the quotes wonderfully humorous and often insightful films of this charming and often insightful film. Dudley Moore is charming, kind and wealthy. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a non-parent / child relationship that defines the man to whom Arthur will become. Will it follow your heart and soul, or just your wealth? Over twenty-five years, I returned to this film with joy, fun and joy. It's a movie to go back to, over and over again, and remember what's important in life, as short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
