This is another great movie that I was lucky enough to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). In the late 80's I was a beginner relative to the genre and only really new on the big three JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my hard-earned money to see this in a "Triple Bill of Classics" at the old Scala. I do not need to worry, I was out of breath with this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and did not watch this movie, do it NOW!
