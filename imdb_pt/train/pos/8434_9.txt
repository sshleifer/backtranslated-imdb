I've always been a fan of the show so I admit that I'm partial. When the show ended, I felt that many questions remained unanswered. This movie to me seemed like a foreclosure. Seeing all the people I've been with in the last few years together has finally been very rewarding. I've heard that this is probably the only Homicide movie we can expect. If so, this is the appropriate way out. This movie is sometimes poignant, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfying. If you are or have already been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
