Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> Beauty plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his aged wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor spend the night at his house and find out that he is responsible for the deaths of the brides, the next morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and falls dead shortly afterwards. <br /> You have almost everything in this movie: Scientist's assistants consist of an old witch, a hunchback and dwarf (her children), a storm and frightening passages in Bela's house. Bela and her wife think they sleep better in coffins than in beds in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes is worth it, especially for fans of Bela Lugosi. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
