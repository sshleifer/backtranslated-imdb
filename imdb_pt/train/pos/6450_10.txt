This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. This leads me to a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and I cry and I get angry and happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are all brilliant! I have to mention the lead actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job !! I also admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this mentally challenging young man in such a convincing way! He kind of reminded me of the Leonardo di Caprios roll in Gilbert Grape! And then there's the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy!
