This show is incredible. I thought the two episodes in which Paul died were so sad; I really cried. But the other shows were awesome; Kerry was my favorite character because she was on the "dark side". I also thought Bridget was funny because she was all cheerful. I also thought the guy who played Kyle was really, really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic comments about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was very funny. This whole TV show is funny, and I wish they would still show it on TV. when they showed on TV, I watched every time I was on. The next time I show up, I'll watch it several times.
