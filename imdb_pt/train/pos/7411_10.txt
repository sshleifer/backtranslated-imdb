The key to life's joy and beauty, pain and sorrow is our ability to accept that life is basically what it is, so that we do not constantly struggle against this one compelling truth. In doing so, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us to understand. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, more of a fable, which is played very well. Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than just watching actors. <br /> <br /> I struggled to write a review of this good movie so that others would be motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in a bathroom. Sounds like a real shutdown, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title for this movie is The Shower, but this is almost an antithesis to an important thematic element in this film, which is the bath. I'm still lost. Talking about the story or about the characters will not do them justice. <br /> <br /> So, I'll tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how exciting and touching it was. I was also quite entertained. I cared deeply about the characters and I cared deeply about what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you've been moved by movies like The King of Masks or No Less, then be sure to check out The Shower. Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality are great. I watched the original lanquage with well-placed and well-placed English submarines. <br /> <br />
