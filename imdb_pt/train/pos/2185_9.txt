Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who lost his muse. He's been pretending for some time, buying his lyrics and songs from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby's song) and (Mary Martin's words) end up meeting and falling in love. And then they find out what they're doing. The complications happen, but everything is right in the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing beautifully. Mary signed a contract with Paramount and at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall radio show. For reasons I do not understand, the audience of the movie did not take to her, so she went back to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does very well. Their ego is constantly being emptied by helper Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised they did not do any more movies together. <br /> <br /> As with most Crosby vehicles at Paramount, there are no large production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer on the title melody was made as an impromptu jam session at a pawn shop. Good work for everyone. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
