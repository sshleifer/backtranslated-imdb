Before seeing this, I was disconcerted by the subject, but this is not your average triumph over the history of adversity. Although this is technically about blind Tibetan children climbing Mt. Everest, there is much more than that. This film shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two highly talented blind adults who lead children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind athlete / climber and Sabriye is a blind German scholar who founded a school in Lhasa Tibet. Both are exceptional in their own ways, but disagree on what really will build trust in children. Erik wants them to reach the summit, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a model and take pleasure in the moment. The nuances are complicated and the person walks away without really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The deeper scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties faced before finding their way to school. The most touching thing for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I was able to watch an entire movie about his life and I was happy to know that, thanks to the school, he is now running a small business of success with some of his colleagues. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love it.
