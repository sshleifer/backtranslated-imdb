Two marksmen travel deep into the jungles in search of their targets; a draconian lord of the South American drug and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> Moderately successful in building a shocking atmosphere, Sniper is in most cases a very solid suspense, taking time, setting his characters and their difficulties and climax. in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful at keeping the mood dark and could have hardened the story a little; some deviations here do not add much. But this movie is so much better than your Stallone / Stone The Expert. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper joined veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this movie proved to be his last big big budget venture in Hollywood. He can do this kind of paper while he sleeps and it's very convincing here, replaying the paper two more times straight into the DVD sequences.
