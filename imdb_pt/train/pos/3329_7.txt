The only reason I saw this movie was to Jimmy Fallon, that I've had a downfall since 9th grade, which was his first year at SNL. I'm a diehard Yankees fan, and I did not find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they started showing clips from the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I would not have to hear what should not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played the role very well because the character should be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy. I know it may not be an Oscar winner, but the film is just a light, fun and romantic comedy that is really appropriate for both men and women to see. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had a much better chemistry on the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and, thank goodness, because the Taxi could have killed him. I think Fever Pitch will help you a lot. Everyone needs to stop being so critical of their acting ability because he's just starting out in the movies. I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll see they've started in some failures. Busom's Friends Australian novels? Here's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen. I never wanted him to leave the SNL, but what can you do?
