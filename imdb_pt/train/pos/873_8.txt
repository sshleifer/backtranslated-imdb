I watched this movie not expecting much and did not know much about it. I loved. A very good and tight plot, an intriguing hook in the shape of the ugly, deaf and fat girl and the ex-convict, and a rhythm that kept things flowing without being rushed. <br /> <br /> A much, much better film than De Coutre mon coeur s'est arret√© by the same director, who was boring and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not work very well. It was that the supposedly ugly and fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from being conventionally pretty but with so much character on her face that she took care of the screen whenever she was in it. Great. I wish she were in more movies, and better than she usually is. I saw some of Gilles' wife and a little bit of the mustache, and the two looked like garbage, and I've seen everything I've done, and that's certainly bullshit. She seems to have some coming, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
