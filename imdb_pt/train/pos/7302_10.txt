As I write, John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is approaching its 30th anniversary. Since then, it has spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a big mess of imitations and every year around Halloween, when they make the "Top 10 Most Scary Movie" listings, they are always there. This is quite surprising for a movie that was made with a budget of about $ 300,000 and featured a cast then almost completely unknown to young talent. I could go on and on, but the big question here is: how does the movie stand today? And all I can say is that, fantastically! <br /> <br /> Pros: A simple yet frightening opening credits sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and indecisive score by director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Stellar direction of Carpenter, who keeps the suspense high, receives great photos and is careful not to show much of his villain. Good performances by the mostly unknown cast. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a wicked and scary guy. A lot of weird moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow but steady and never crawls. Unlike most other horror movies, this is more about suspense and terror than blood and a large body count. <br /> <br /> Cons: Probably not as scary now as it was then. Many of the goofs really stand out. Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's really how I feel. Despite this, it is an important movie that continues to reach new generations of moviegoers. And just because it was redone for a new generation does not mean it will be forgotten. No way, I do not eat. My rating: 5/5
