This movie is surprisingly underrated in IMDb. Like so many movies, this is not Shawshank. But it's a fairly good, though predictable dance competition / growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching some sort of 8 Mile for a female dancer, than I think you'll like it. Judging by IMDb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was "bombed" with many 1s, as with so many movies that are not about the Mafia, have no special effects, or include non-white or non-direct characters. It's an American movie, but it's not a US movie. Mainly defined in Toronto, the tracks are subtle, and some audience may think that it is fully defined in the USA just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but I'm not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title sucks. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying those words, and should have an "s". (No, it is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means that you hated it) so I can only assume that it is an expression of hatred for the kind of people, and that it's sad.
