One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the top members of the Mafia, the killer says so, and an expert. One of the kids wants to know his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he hides in his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it that way. <br /> Mafia no rules, no mafia wins, when they want you out, they take you away. Of course you can see someone who works in the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but do the wrong job, or do something that your "boss" does not want, and you're fired and killed . <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he did not have to see, and well, almost his whole family is killed by that "wrong thing" his son did . The movie is really fun, you see how Sullivan lives after being chased by the Mafia, or half way through it. <br /> <br /> This movie is kind of sad, it shows us about revenge, those dirty works that people do, almost everything you like. I hope the guy is reading this comment does not work for the Mafia, and if you work in the Mafia do yourself a favor and get out of the country before being killed by your boss and your workers. <br /> This movie gets: 10/10
