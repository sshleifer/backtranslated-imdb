An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. See how Gene sings, acts and dances in Paris in countless situations. Some purely majestic, other pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly was made of when he made this film just a year before "Singin 'In The Rain." He is definitely one of the big names of all time. It's interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only major difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in LA <br /> <br /> Some said that Leslie Caron's acting was less than pure. Perhaps Cyd Charisse, who was originally designed for the role could have done better, however Caron is quite credible on paper and has chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's brief role in this film gave him exactly what he needed, someone who does not look like Gene Kelly. Filling in the role of common man is not an easy task, but Levant did it with as much class as any other clue. <br /> <br /> The music and dance routines are perfect. Even the long ballet at the end of the film makes it a better movie than without it. Seeing that there really was not much time on the screen to make such a loving relationship, Minnelli used this sequence to look like you spent four hours with them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I would have to rate this movie with Singin ', since it is very similar in history and music. Singing could barely hit her head because of Debbie Reynolds' uplifting performance. <br /> <br /> Complete recommendation. 8/10 stars.
