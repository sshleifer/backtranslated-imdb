I will not go into many details about the plot of this film, since other reviewers have approached practically the same subject. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the movie. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film. <br /> <br /> A little road trip with Falk & Paul Reiser in NY in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the movie. Nicely written with an adult target audience in mind. Plenty of humor based on reality and some well-played dramas give the film the feeling that it could be your own family. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this movie except that it's a shame that such a lovely movie so there is no more exposure while other useless junk out there does. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk with a big lead role again and he takes full advantage. This proves that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right in launching Falk in many of his innovative films of the 60s and 70s.
