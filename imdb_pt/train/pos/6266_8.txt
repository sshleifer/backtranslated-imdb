This photo to me is very good as it is a fun and funny parody of aliens invading a city and many of its men. <br /> <br /> The town and the players are all dressed up in 1950s style and the whole movie has a purposefully tacky and kitschy feel to it. Some of the scenes are hilarious as with the birth of an alien creature. <br /> <br /> All actors give complete and serious performances, which makes the movie even funnier and the special effects and Aliens are at least seems to me to intentionally 3rd rate to add to the fun. <br /> <br /> These types of movies often deserve a following cult: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
