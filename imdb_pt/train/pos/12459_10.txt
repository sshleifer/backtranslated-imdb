This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies. The interaction between respectable and morally incorruptible characters is an ode to chivalry and the code of honor among thieves and police. It deals with topics such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust as few films have done, and unfortunately none that I can remember since the death of the 'cop' in the late seventies. The sequence is delectable, to the point of being, living nothing and taking the viewer into a masterful, right and wrong plot with no attractive fixtures and spectacular scenes that are often needed on smaller specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. None of these scenes are present or necessary. The plot is fluent and honest to the viewer, which is an important asset in a genre in which suspense is often achieved through public confusion. No, this is not missing Marble ... A note of congratulations on the song is in order A movie to watch and savor every minute, not just to see.
