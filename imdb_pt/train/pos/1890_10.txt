This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can cite the most. Some of the lines in this movie are simply unbeatable. I particularly like to see him stumble and fall drunk, go out to the drunken restaurant and party with the moose. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I've seen this sequence, but it's funny every time. From the moment that Arthur arrives at the place of the father of Susan with the moose, you laugh all the time. I remember watching the takes of the moose. He fell as I imagined it would. They were laughing so hard it was hard for them to film. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to it. His behavior, his demeanor, and the way he dealt with Arthur were equally hilarious. It's always a funny time when he hits his head with his hat or says he's a little ____ spoiled. I laugh every time I hear the "I'm going to take a shower" and the speeches that follow.
