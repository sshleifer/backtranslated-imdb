The whole purpose of making this film, one of the first and best international releases of film opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And he did amazingly in doing so. The general public would not be put off by a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt, if touched by the typical 300-pound tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual replacement of the beautiful directors (a young Loren, a beautiful Della Marra and a stealthy Mrs. Maxwell) who make the story much more believable, giving those who are unfamiliar with the plot or music a better chance of being attracted to the lovely Arias who otherwise might not be. All in all, a charming introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in high school and it certainly sparked my interest in opera, a form I was not quite familiar with. I still consider this movie with affection and recommend it a lot for those who can enjoy good music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a highlight as Radames, and unfortunately for the public did not appear in any other film.
