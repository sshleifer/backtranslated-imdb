This is the kind of movie the US does not. That's why people rent foreign films. It's a great story about how a person, even if retarded, can make a person find reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally challenged suffer in their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). Like his classic in foreign films, this movie has a bittersweet ending, but that just makes it a better movie.
