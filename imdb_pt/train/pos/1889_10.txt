My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. We have most of the rows memorized. I watched two weeks ago and still get excited by the simple humor and vision that Dudley Moore plays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - although I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his bride's house. His conversation with Susan's butler and father is spit on the side. The butler's phrase "Would you like to wait in the Library," followed by Arthur's response: "Yes, the bathroom is out of the question," is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny thing "!
