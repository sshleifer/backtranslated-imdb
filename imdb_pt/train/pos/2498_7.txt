I picked it up in the 'Danger After Dark' box and watched it solely because of my interest in Hyde and Gackt's performance. I expected a cheesy horror movie to be a huge party with a really bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead, I was intrigued by the good character development and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good considering they are not professional actors, and the director did a wonderful job with all that, setting it in the future except for flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other movie I've seen is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this movie he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a kind of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the great bully of the island that killed without thinking of any of that. So beware of his performance, if you are familiar with Battle Royale, you will be very surprised by it. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the résumé on the back of the box. , because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. The character of Hyde is a vampire is almost a background fact with what is really happening in the foreground, and you will love the last scene. It is a very touching image in some points, the photograph is very well made. It's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at Blockbuster.
