This is a film that on the surface seems to be all about J. Edgar Hoover giving himself a big pat on the back for fighting the Klan, chasing the Indian assassins, hunting down the famous 30s gangsters, fighting the Nazis in the USA and the South America during World War 2 and Commies in New York during the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959 we did not know of Hoover's obsession with keeping secret files about honest Americans, bothering people like Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. , but even worse, his secret love affair with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about it, I suggest watching Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, this story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes a decent but dated film. Vera Miles, as his devoted wife, is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover controlled production and always made sure the FBI was seen flawlessly, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, a great achievement, considering that Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The background score is also nice. I read recent online articles suggesting this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show this a long time ago and I hope they show it again.
