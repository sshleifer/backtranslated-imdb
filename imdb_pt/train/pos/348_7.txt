These slasher photos have already been sold, but this is good fun. <br /> <br /> Valentine's day cards are witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> The movie has a Peach. of a line ... "He is no angel ...." when he is indeed an angel! Watching Buffy's reruns will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The cast is an exhibition of young talents, but the story does not give them real enough depth. Denise Richards on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on the set were pretty close together and that would give you the feeling that you were sympathetic to her characters. Sorry but no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, being able to show very little blood and trust in your implied threat imagination. Much can also be said for the similar way in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main plus of the board is within the "loan" of several other Ideas of previous slasher films Psycho's shower scene is spread out, along with the "masking" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> Murder someone hidden in a bodybag is quite unique, as far as I know! /> <br /> The light vision, not too scary, but a few good moments of leaping.If it was a choice between The Hole and this, choose The Hole.Recreation movies have had their day, and this is just more a slasher .. good slasher, but nothing innovative !!!
