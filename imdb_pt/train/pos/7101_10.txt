Contrary to popular belief, this title, to me at least, is not that bad. Indeed. I consider this a favorite movie of all time. The story soldering was not structured very well when you consider the differences between the series, however, despite all this, you can watch it very happy. For a movie of your day, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable. <br /> <br /> The sound / audio track is one of my favorites. Almost everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices adapt to the characters much better than their now-ill-fused US voice actors, counterparts. Sync is perfect on all shots. I had some problems with casting for the 'alien' voices (please excuse the gross nomination, it's been a while since I've seen this). Otherwise, however, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe the characters in this movie. Dubs are often a subject with which I rarely agree long ago. I loved the OSDs of the time, but the casts usually let the series fall. <br /> <br /> At this point I would like to add that this was one of the first anime I've seen in my life. It has historical value to me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it remained stronger and more watched in my collection. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the title only came to the US in Texas. Personally, I think it's a great shame. If the right audience was subject to this, I think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years. I'm involved with anime every day of my life and everyone I've shown this movie thought it was a title well put together. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its separate components will allow the viewer to perceive the plot obvious holes between shows. However, without seeing the originals, the viewer would not really notice. As the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it in its day. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs have been the most productive media. Personally I like the way Carl had the courage to at least push the genre. I mean, Harmony was not going to put the money into the series to be released. <br /> <br /> Despite the few flaws people have had with this movie, The Eighties feel they keep me in love. If you watch Megazone 23 now, its original Japanese audio, or the new dub, I believe you will be very disappointed with the OSD. Cast your minds back to the original soundtrack of Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine the new audio of the eighties in E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Saying all this. The popularity of this movie nowadays is probably its rarity in the open market. Personally generated a collection for me. Now I'm scouring the world for goods from all three components and if I ever get to know Carl Macek I'd shake his hand by the effort and buy him a mug or box to put me on the anime.
