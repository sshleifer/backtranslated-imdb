Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see. It is very rhythmic, well represented and does not leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions, so typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage plays Michael, an arrogant Texan unemployed man, desperate enough to get a job. all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest to a fault, but always on the dark side of fate. <br /> <br /> After getting no gainful employment, Michael stumbles on the Red Rock bar where owner Wayne (JTWalsh) mistakes him for a rent matador he summoned from Dallas, hired to do in his lovely, most lethal wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a payment for success in the adulterous Suzie. Without intending to move on, Michael accepts the money and then leaves to warn Suzanne of her impending death. He also sends a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and divides it. <br /> <br /> As fate would dictate, Michael will not get rid of the situation so easily. Upon leaving in a violent storm, he descends Suzannes lover. Of course Michael is Michael, he takes him to the local hospital where it is discovered that he was also shot. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is summoned, and luckily Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on the last ride and is later captured by the true "Lyle of Dallas", played with murderous joy by the peculiar Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they are fellow sailors, Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink, where else, the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in pursuit of Michael, who voluntarily falls in Suzannes, waiting for arms. <br /> <br /> As the pace increases, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted by armed robbers. the lam for a steal of several million dollars. Getting the money now becomes the central focus of the film with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The film was very well released. Nicolas Cage was typically discreet, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than enough skill. The best performance was for the late J.T. Walsh, who was menacing without seeming to be. Walsh was a great actor who left us very soon. <br /> <br /> Marc Reshoskys photography has utilized many unique angles that have increased plot suspense and development. The film was reinforced by John Dahl's directional style and the rapid fire edition of Morris Chestnut.
