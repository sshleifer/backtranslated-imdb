Around 1986, I saw this movie by accident on TV one night. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my accidental view of the terrible end of Do not Look Now in 1987. I went to Venice on vacation the following year in silent terror, hoping God would not find out I had attended! <br /> <br /> Would it have mattered to me if my parents knew that I had seen Les Valseuses when I was a child? I would probably avoid it with my father until now, and my mother would probably disapprove of the afterlife. I do not know if they want to see it anyway. Ever since the chase and capture of a woman in the apartment block in the first scene sliding down the mountain roads with glazed, satiated eyes, I'm never sure if this movie is an insensitive piece of junk that disregards the sexual revolution or whether it's a movie sexy liberator to watch as you realize that you could never be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It's definitely violent. She has a violent view of sex, virtually no recognition of love. Even sucking a baby turns into a greedy exploitation sexual act. But the setting is very erotic and (god I'm so British) waking up! Do they suck your breasts for your own good? This is exploitation. So why am I getting a wood? <br /> <br /> The companions go in search of an older and experienced woman, find a former prisoner, a maternal figure? I do not know. This ends in a truly horrible suicide. I described this to my friend JB Nelson, who has cannibal Holocaust-courage, and he was eeuurrgghh! No maternal love for this film, on the contrary. Mutilation from where the boys started. Why do they throw the girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Do women need to be punished to learn what is right for men? <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two films, one of which I wish I had never seen, the other that makes me wish for such a tough world. Swept Away / Madonna What a stack of insanity does not compute has ever been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a slave to the man and maybe it's madonna saying that everyone respects ritchie man I'm so enraged that I can not use punctuation ! Once Upon A Time In America / Leone God, Why Does Noodles Do It? It destroys the path of joy that we follow in all your life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Because? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but much sex and nudity in abundance, of both sexes. Very honest, no excitement. No fancy, no perfect Hollywood move. Jokes, yes. But there is a lot of darkness, jealousy and tricks here to call it a sexual comedy. Forget to continue shooting at a naked hairdresser in the leg because she will return and you will win her with the son of revenge your ex-con lover and she will learn how to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, nobody's going to want to watch it now! It's a brilliant movie!
