I watched Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is "original". It's a word that is not widely used on TV since they all tend to copy what the other network is doing, and you end up having seven nights of crime shows, bland comedies and crap. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are unfamiliar with the British series "Carry On ..." or those who have not heard a Harry Potter book may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if your presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I'll have to tune in more, but that gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, the White Countess) has a gift. He never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He joins Chi McBride ("Boston Public", Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can not send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult? <br /> <br /> I'll be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain.
