I saw this movie earlier today, and was impressed by the accuracy of the dialogue for the main characters. It did not look like a movie - it looked more like a documentary (the part I liked the most). The protagonists of this film seemed to me as real as any fifteen year old girls I know. <br /> <br /> In short, a very nice film for those who like independent films.
