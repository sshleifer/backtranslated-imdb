After a slow start, BRUCE ALTIGHTY is a very funny movie that had something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good times. I miss Steve Correll on "THE SHOW DIAL!" <br /> <br /> I like director Tom Shadyac's movie choices. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a great comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy, manages the talent that can and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story, it is hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more Bible references. I only remember three specific Bible references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the early drafts of the script had more biblical references, but they were cut because the producers were afraid to offend people. This is too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My notes: <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
