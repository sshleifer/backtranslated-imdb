A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors, such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes get stuck on the screen and you do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the movie, waiting for what fate will bring to the characters. This movie makes you leave your position as the standard audience, you enter, makes you a part of the story ... Costumes and scenery are brilliant; especially the okiyas district is cleverly constructed. It is definitely not much Akira Kurosawa, however, still receives much from the master, especially the stylistic history tells us that we are in a land of the cinema that is a far cry from the Hollywood extravaganza.
