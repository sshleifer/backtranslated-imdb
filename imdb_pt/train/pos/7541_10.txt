This Showtime movie really deserves a much better rating than a 4.5; I gave a 10 based on the story and acting of the two stars. After reading the comments of the viewer, I was surprised at how many people expected this movie to be a comedy. Yes, I see the IMDb listed as comedy / drama under the genre. This is certainly misleading, is not it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before entering this site, so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I hoped it was simply a drama. I'm wondering if being disappointed with this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor that may have caused low votes is that this movie is very 'character driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. The previous comment from someone complained about a boring test. Tom's work scenes (Danny Glover) seemed to distract from the real plot of the film. That is, as he was planning the ascending social ascension of his family - or his personal troops if you will. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as their right to move to Greenwich and rise in the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His disgust when another black person moved to the next door was not due to the color of the skin. It was because of everything the "intruder" represented; everything Tom left behind. In essence, Tom became an Oreo cookie: black on the outside but white on the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film are among the most powerful writing, directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I've had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the climax of the movie was not the obvious event that happened next door (I do not want to give it for free). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still unclear if it's the conversation when she informs Tom that the Tom-Two college is going or when she launches, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. However, the outcome is great. You know life on that street will never be the same again. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of character-driven film: people go through problems, some pain, dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on. As a member of the audience, I can learn something or be inspired.
