In the near future, Arnold stars as Ben Richards, an unjustly convicted man coerced into playing "The Running Man," a deadly TV show where people have to keep moving to try to escape brutal brutality. deaths at the hands of the Stalkers. Of course, people should eventually die and it's up to Arnold to prove that the system is wrong. <br /> <br /> I did not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great movie regardless of Arnold's best. . He does what he does best in the role of action man, delivering death with unforgettable one-liners. The classics are probably the "He was a real pain in the neck" after strangling a guy with barbed wire and "He had to separate!", Referring to whereabouts he just sawed into the chain vertically. Dawson is perfectly annoying as the TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' are properly camped out. The action is violent, but it's an action movie. That is the question. The movie is fast, and at 90 minutes, it is not more than welcome. With Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch in charge, and made following the success of Terminator, this film was previously seen as just another foolish action vehicle for Arnold, and much unlikely. But today, anyone who watches a lot of TV can see how the movie is approaching reality. I would not be surprised if I turned on the TV in the 'near future' and saw a show not far from it. <br /> <br /> On that depressing note, I must recommend 'The Running Man' to anyone who likes the '80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 10/10
