This movie has to be seen in the right mood. First, the central relationship between father and son makes it very clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his film "Drunken Master" by Wong Fei Hung (the ideas of this film are repeated in "Drunken Master II") and not "Young Master "; that Chan walked away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced that the material was fitting properly and, in fact, the film conveys a sense of incompleteness; for example, the romantic relationship around which half the plot revolves is left completely at the end of the film. "Young Master" of the same period, also feels bad, but at least all of its core yarns are tied together in the end. This movie looks like Chan struggled with the plot and characters trying to find their central theme, only to abandon the effort, possibly due to time and budget. <br /> <br /> Or maybe the movie is just too ambitious. <br /> <br /> This is an important turning point in Chan's career because he commits himself to develop the central character above all other concerns - that is why there is a lack of kung fu throughout the film . Chan wants to make a historical romantic comedy that happens to have kung fu in it. But both the historical element and the romantic element are little more than twists. <br /> <br /> That leaves us with comedy. As Chan's concern is the development of the character, the comedy is largely influenced by the character - as in the conflict between the character of Chan and his best friend, a discussion about a girl. But there is a lot of clowning too. Frankly, I find the comedy fun enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot. <br /> <br /> This film represents an effort on the part of Chan to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time. It does not work well, and Chan would only find this formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films with the production of the contemporary action comedy "Police Story." But back to see this movie is still very informative about how Chan worked his way through the historical genre, and perhaps why he abandoned it.
