This movie is so misunderstood that it is not funny either. If you think about seeing this for the shootings ... stay clear. This deals with the effects and traumas that survivors must endure. Even the detectives are looking for the answer we all make ... WHY? Fantastic performance of the two leading ladies, when we see how those we ignore are affected by the same things with which we are affected. Yes, the language is sometimes hard, but it serves the characters well. There are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all movies have these. The key issues are addressed and this film makes an important statement about how all of us adults feel after major incidents. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults alike.
