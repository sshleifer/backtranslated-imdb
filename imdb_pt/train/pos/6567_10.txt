Most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who are not being very critical or maybe expected something else. This is one of my favorite 1980s movies, it grows in you and has it all. I just bought it on DVD and 20 years later still does not disappoint, taking lots of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that the great car chases, automatic weapon firefights and lots of things exploding and you'll have a fun experience on the edge! You'll even hum or whistle the main song for days after you see it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and both will have lots of fun. The premise is that of a pocketbook hero, such as Doc Savage, actually existent and help people fight evil, so he can write history, is almost true to life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also the director, producer and writer of many films. In this movie, Jake Speed ​​(the character) is a kind of adventurer of Indiana Jones, he usually uses his head to get out of difficult situations, but sometimes resorts to brutal firepower (yay !, and pure luck!). Keep an eye on your unique high-tech "James Bond" equipment, the ultimate SUV road warrior falling from the sky. <br /> <br /> Heroine is the very loving interest of young vampire Jim Carey. film "Once Bitten" and here she is a bit older and still a knockout, even compared to her blonde teen sister. <br /> <br /> Bandits are "very bad" men and they are the worst lowlife villains that you love to hate. The ending is simply perfect and you can either stand alone or invite a sequel, sadly never done - but you can imagine what would happen next! <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie just because it will entertain and entertain you and this is worth the price of a ticket.
