This is a very good Spanish film but I am worried that many out there feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I had a great advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you put together all the pieces. I doubt that's a big concern in Spain where this movie was made, but for other audiences, they might get a bit confused until later in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Carol, 12 years old. and her mother returning to her mother's hometown. The years have passed and you know they are coming to Spain from New York. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and much of the film is about how she fits. As for why she and her mother are alone, I will now tell those who do not realize the fact that Carol's father is fighting Republican side war (which ended up losing in this bloody conflict). ). <br /> <br /> The film earns exceptional scores for its camera work and music. The slow, disconnected pace is not bad, as long as you are someone who can accept movies that way. I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and this compares very well to them - not better or worse - just a decent slice of the movie's life about those who are left behind as well as a good old coming movie. PS - If you do not know which side you are on, the Republicans were mostly Socialists and were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from various countries (including the US). The nationalists were led by Franco and aided by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
