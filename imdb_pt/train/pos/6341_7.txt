Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's "serious" performances ("The Man on the Moon"), I always thought his true genius is physical comedy. This is not to say that he is a fantastic and talented actor: the Academy Awards bozos seem not to like him so much, he never had a nomination or award (truly deserved). Well, any "institution" that names 11 Oscars as "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> With criticism. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, most beautiful, best-represented and most enjoyable film since "The Nightmare Before Christmas." Both films look very similar, too, with their highly stylized scenarios and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their main actors look like villains (one in a higher degree than the other), both bring a strong moral lesson, and both are really nice. <br /> <br /> That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and the Grinch is a human being. But a human being who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so caricature, so unreal, that he never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world, where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and finally he saves Christmas. I loved this movie in pieces, and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those movies you really like in 10 to 20 years. As timeless as they come.
