The anime that left me addicted to anime ... <br /> <br /> In the year 2010 (hey, this is not far away now!) The Earth is now a poisonous gas, desert of pollution and violence. Seeing how the crimes are happening in 30 seconds are like that and committed by thieves who have the firepower of Third World terrorists, the government of the fictional New Port City forms the Tank Police to deal with the problem - tank cops! Oh, insanity! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include new recruit Leona Ozaki, a Japanese red-haired (yes, I know, they never combine their distinctively Japanese names with a Japanese look) that has just been summoned to the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with the blonde, blue-eyed legal guy Al. Leona is new to the use of tanks and unfortunately she destroys the Tank of Tank Commander's favorite tank Charles Britain (aka "Brenten" ), a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of cool sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad mood. Britain did not like having Leona joining the Tank Police in the first place and she destroying her Tiger Special (a giant tank of green monsters) is not exactly attractive to him, nor does he like her by taking away the remains of her giant tank and use it to build a mini tank that she nicknamed Bonaparte and he is soon pushing for it to be transferred to child welfare "where boys are more than their size," as he says. There are also Specs, the bifocal genius, quoting the Bible / God fearing chaplain, mohican purple MO-hawked, and the potbellied chief who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always shouting at him over the antics of the Tank police. Seeing how tank cops often destroy half of the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they are not much appreciated by the people. <br /> <br /> The "villains" are a cyborg. called Buaku, who has a mysterious past that is connected to a project known as "Green Peace," his gang and his two sexy cyborg-cat partners, Anna & Uni Puma. In the first part, these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital that treats people who have not been infected by clouds of poison gas, and in the second, are hired to steal a painting that is from a naked Buaku. The story, however, was incomplete in the anime and was finished in a cult comic book ("Manga") that is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> All kinds of chaos and chaos happen in this black comic venture. which examines how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get confused. This is the kind of thing that if you were to make a movie, you had better go get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in some places, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".
