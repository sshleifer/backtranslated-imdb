Let's think people no longer speak evil of the original as it is time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, yet with all the stars, story lines and art. Lorne Greene was great because Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect, since Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny like Starbuck, but I dare say he's not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar, War of the Gods, the best was Experiment in Earth, I thought it was a homage in a way Heaven Can Wait, so you had the women of Battlestar, not to compare them to Tricia, who is exceptionally beautiful as Number Six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour could not be compared. Much less Loerrta Spang like Cassiopea was fantastic. She had beauty that a rainbow would be ashamed for. I loved the original as much as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
