The symbolic use of objects, the editing of shapes, the position of characters in the scene ... these were all used with such abandon by Hitchcock that you can actually see what fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a bit obvious by today's standards, in the it was silent they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet the lover buys, and the love triangle at the heart of the story.
