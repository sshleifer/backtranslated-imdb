This is a sublime piece of filmmaking. It flows at the right pace everywhere. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasing to the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the film's extremely depressing and tragic nature. <br /> <br /> However, despite many comments about the tragedy inherent in the plot, it was anything but depressing for me to watch. I liked it in a way that I have not experienced for a long time. That is, it is superb and yet without all the common pitfalls of modern movies, such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> 'Dan In Real Life' has nothing to do without regular addictions. It has a fully matured plot that does not require, and indeed would be ruined, any additional embellishment. At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. It is a work of art in itself and it encapsulates you completely and you do not want anything more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that look a bit like 'Waltons', but they really make all the sense in the long run, as they contrast the most dysfunctional moments. The rosier opens the way for the tragic who then surrenders to the idyllic that turns into the darkest, etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of stability similar to lithium. The ups and downs are soothing, but more than adequate, at the pleasure they indulge in. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie regardless of the genre that you usually like. Put aside any bias, because this is a must see!
