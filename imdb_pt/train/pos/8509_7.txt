I hate reading reviews that say something like, "Do not waste time, this movie smells like ice." That to that reviewer still to me, may have some kind of naive charm. If you like the other 'Whistler' movies, this one will be watchable. If you like 40 year old movies, this one will be watchable. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the previous series that starred Richard Dix as the protagonist. It is much slower and the plot is banal. You have seen this same narrative device used in many other movies and generally better. <br /> <br /> But the acting is good, as is enlightenment and dialogue. It's just lack of energy and you'll probably find out exactly what's going on and how everything will come out in the end no more than a quarter of the way. The series 'Whistler' is semi-noir, and there character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles are more important than history itself. But this movie is not noir. It's very light and innocent Hollywood for that. Neither Richard Dix's character nor any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end. You just never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> But still, I would recommend this for at least a single view. I watched it at least twice, and got a fair amount of pleasure out of it both times.
