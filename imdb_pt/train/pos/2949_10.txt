This is the funniest I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest I've ever seen. If you do not choke on absolute laughter then this is not your cup of tea. But I honestly do not know anyone who has seen it I did not like. Now it's 17 years later and my friends and I still quoted everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game, Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man, Ralph and Ed to GO OUT !! There are so many individual and collective skits of hilarity here that if you honestly have not seen this movie then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever. Get any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even the greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will overcome it. I do not know how or where Murphy got any of his stuff, but it works. That's what comes down. It's funny as hell. <br /> <br /> Could you imagine how this show might have shocked people who were accustomed to Eddie doing Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and such in SNL? If you listen to the audience when he makes his first joke or when he says the word F for the first time, they are in complete shock. <br /> <br /> The first time he says that the word F is when he makes the sketch about Mr. T being a homosexual. "Hey boy, hey boy, you look so handsome in jeans, now come over here and fuck me in the ass"! "<br /> <br /> The crowd burst out in laughter <br /> <br /> No one was expecting the dirty mouth that it triggered on them <br /> <br /> But the results were simply fantastic.I was never bombarded with ruthless comedy the way I was in this stand-up And the next time my stomach ached so much with laughter it was not until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK: GREATEST AND AMAZING.This comedy was crude and unmemorable and went to jugular, as did DELIRIOUS. I think it's possible to watch this piece of comics and not laugh.It's almost twenty years later and still the funniest thing on video. "I took your kids fishing last week. And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing rod back. on the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus. Normal kids do not do shit like that Gus. Then they started to shake their heads around like this and m **** f ***** So they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo! I said, can you believe this, shit? "<br /> <br /> Look again and be prepared to laugh at your damn ass off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
