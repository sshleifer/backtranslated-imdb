Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic tale of good old revenge, and what better cause of revenge than the abduction of an innocent girl. The writers did an excellent job in this film of building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so the viewer could understand and really feel the urge Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a chorus type trying to save Pita through the "proper" channels, but instead used tactics of torture and street intelligence. Some may say, "Torture is wrong, regardless," and you may be right, but when you see the pain that Creasy goes through because of Pita's loss and the sheer passion he has for having her back, you can not. leave it aside with Creasy and pull him to be even more ruthless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different mobsters and nefarious criminals and he knew it. <br /> <br /> Creasy's quest ended with Pita's return to her mother and Creasy dying in her mother's vehicle. bandits But the death of Creasy did not diminish the effectiveness of the film; in fact, he improved showing that Creasy was willing to die to retrieve Pita. His death was noble indeed. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job as the writers. This movie deserves good marks because it was definitely a good movie.
