"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far I've seen this movie three times in theaters and I look forward to buying it on DVD next September. I read the book after watching the movie and was impressed by how much the book and the film were alike. The director of this film did a great job of re-creating the book in film form. In addition, all the actors selected to play the roles were wonderful interpreting their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props for everyone involved in making this movie was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I would definitely recommend it for everyone to see!
