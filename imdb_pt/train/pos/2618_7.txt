Possible SPOILERS: I'm not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 Â½, I could not help but have mixed feelings about the entire movie. It's definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that gives you the same kind of feeling the Lion King did. The story, for those who have not read the other reviews, is about how Timon and Pumba meet, and how they affect the events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are some funny jokes in the story. movie. My favorite part is when they show the pair lifting Simba. However, for me, the worst parts should be when they show Timon and Pumbah interfering directly in the events of the original. I can never look at the "Circle of Life" or "You can feel love tonight" sequences the same way again (I'm fine with the string "I can not wait to be king"). <br /> <br /> The talents of the voice are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, as does Matthew Broderick, the guy who does Rafiki and the hyenas. Even the actor who plays the young Simba sounded like Jonathon Taylor Thomas to me. But why did they include a voiceover for Zazu? He literally had only 2 lines, and none of them was much needed. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only increase talent, though you still can not hear the voice of Timon's mother and not think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not seem to fit the original, which comes to mind being when they are rock pride in the end. How did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, you can not help feeling that for a set of 2 discs, the special features are especially lacking. They could easily fit a comment or other aspect ratio on the first disc. I liked the game "Who Wants to be King of the Jungle", even though it is the most shameful cross-promotion example I've ever seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, although not as good as the TLK or even the TLK2.
