The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film worth it. <br /> <br /> Bo, looking more beautiful than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is going through visits from her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must seek the body of a young man so that his husband's ghost can turn his specter back into bodily life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How is she going to do him so Tony can do his thing? With Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, the presence of Quinn's film and, thanks to John, a very exotic look for the entire film, this film is a delight to see.
