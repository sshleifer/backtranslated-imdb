I had the privilege of having seen some excerpts from Aardman's original performance of this show in the UK. It's always been fun and always funny. None of the charms was lost in the translation - it is as new as the people interviewed - whether part of it is scripted or not, as has been rumored, is irrelevant. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the only aspect that I probably love most about the program and its concept (hostility between pandas, porcupines who discuss the fear). of needles, the paint monkey). Regular really do grow on you too, like the horse and dunce teenagers from Maryland, most all couples (parrots, insects and cats, to name a few) and childish voice character, and I actually came to dig the ferret! Monday finally became a day to wait for.
