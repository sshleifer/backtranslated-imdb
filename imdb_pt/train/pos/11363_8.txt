Imagine being so harmed by a bureaucracy that a man spends 8 years of his life, and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually alone! The murder technique is clear, but a government that does not want to admit the truth lets a monster destroy dozens of lives. When I think my work is stressful, I just remember the true story behind this wonderful movie. The main character's devotion to duty was masterfully portrayed by Rea. The comic (and almost tragic at times) relationship between Rea and the character Sutherland made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years. The capture of one of the worst mass murderers in history left me on the edge of my seat. Although not as well advertised and spoken as "Silence of the Lamb," the plot was so full of suspense. Rent or buy this movie today!
