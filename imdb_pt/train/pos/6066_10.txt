When I first saw this movie, it was a long time ago in VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. A few years ago I saw another movie, called: * Incredible Adventure by Andy Colby * In this movie were parts of * Wizards of the lost kingdom * used. They called this movie "KOR the conquerer." I started looking for "KOR" -Movie many years, because I wanted to see the full movie, not just the parts that were used in * Andy Colby * -Movie. No store had this Kor-Movie to rent and no store knew this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS tapes I had at home, and what a marvel ... I've had this movie for many years still at home, but the film had a different title because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had a lot more time watching * KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the movie of the hole, but the best part of the footage in combination with the song is this moment, when the KOR is walking drunk by the green forest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the movie. Both did the job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thank you all for reading my review.
