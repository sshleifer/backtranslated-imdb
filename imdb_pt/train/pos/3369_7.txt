Despite what the title may imply, "Pigs Is Pigs" is not starring Porky Pig. On the contrary, it features a young pig with a more insatiable appetite than the character of John Belushi in "Animal House". His mother repeatedly berates him, but that is no good. So much so that he goes to another house where a demented scientist feeds him more than any mortal can handle (but there is a surprise in the end). <br /> <br /> I would say that this drawing seemed like a space between the big cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after that). But make no mistake about it, they do some cool stuff here. The whole sequence of forced feeding seems more relevant today, given the epidemic of obesity that dominates our country. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not the biggest cartoon, but worth seeing.
