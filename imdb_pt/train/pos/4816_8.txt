I really enjoyed the movie. It will certainly leave the public wanting to know more, and there is much more historically to discover! <br /> <br /> Did the production team fall into the temptation to dramatize, particularly in the filming event? Is there a ton of interesting stuff suggested in? Prince Albert's contribution to the UK and to the monarchy guarantees a film by itself, but that apparently was not part of the intention here. The costumes and scenarios are especially good, but I'm alone in thinking that this production (which, judging by the length of the titles at the end, was certainly not cheap) wanted a lot for a label specialist in history. British court beyond the Duchess of York? That is, did Princess Victory actually put a whole truffle / rissole in her mouth while talking to the Prime Minister in Her Majesty's company with her mouth full? <br /> <br /> 'I could never really feel that sympathetic with Victoria in this movie, or even in her shoes at all. However, I loved the cast of directors, whose acting was compelling, did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? I have always felt like a disinterested and uninterested external observer, much more than with "Mrs. Brown" or even "The Queen." However, to be honest, I still could not take my eyes off the screen except that it is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques that distract from time to time.
