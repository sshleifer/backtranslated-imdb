Diego Armando Maradona was, and still remains the best football player, the game offered. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documentary whether the 1986 World Cup will live forever in the memories of all football fans around the world. Because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal, which he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no point in lowering that star. Although I do not understand Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine narrator. He really cries of happiness, and can barely express his emotion ..... Everything I wrote may be foolish and difficult to understand, but readers ..... you have to watch this to know what I mean.
