What was always missing in the history of the Matrix was how things came out in the real world. Do not say anything else, because that part of the story has covered most of the bases. What was truly interesting was how political it was, maybe even a cheap shot in the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of when it came to fighting the robotic horde, who were merely servants of mankind. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. We as humans tend to fall into this trap quite often, leaving the lack of logic and thought to take us because people can not believe otherwise. Well represented and together, this is a true testimony to how illogical humans can be.
