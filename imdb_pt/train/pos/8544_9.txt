This movie never received the attention it deserved, although this is one of the best set pieces and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well played by Eric Stoltz. Joel was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and arrives at the hospital in an infirmary with other men who had spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows the first signs of his later Oscar-winning work. <br /> <br /> Although Joel-Anna's relationship is the basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job like the angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss. I think the two best scenes of Forsythe are when he gets frustrated and angry at square dancers, and later when he feels empathy for a young Korean who was shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is the discussion at the roundtable of post-injury sexual options. The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate but not free sex scenes. The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and fun. There is also another memorable scene in which Joel, Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially equipped van to the strip bar. It's really a comedy of mistakes as they make their weak attempts to make the van see the "naked women". <br /> <br /> The story is even more moving because the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This movie is real, not brilliant or flashy. Having the amount of talent in a movie with such a small budget is incredible. I recommend this movie to everyone I see because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look. It's a shame that such a great work is neglected, but through the video, maybe it gets the attention it deserves.
