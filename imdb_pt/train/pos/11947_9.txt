Simply well-written, directed and rendered ... Woody's best of the 2000's, if not your best since the 80's !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing not to be in a novel on screen with the protagonist. He plays the perfect clumsy magician. <br /> <br /> There have been some criticisms about this movie. Do not let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully made movie. The people in the crowd I saw this were laughing so loud on some lines that I missed the next line. If you like Woody Allen's 70's movies, you'll be sorry you missed this one. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go watch this movie with an open mind, if you do, you can come out smiling.
