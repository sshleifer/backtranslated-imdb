I found this intriguing movie and its refreshing ambiguity in a fast-paced movie world where we are manipulated to love the "good guy" and hate the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of portraying the black sheep / lost child family aspiring to win the love and respect of his father, as well as that of his sister-in-law widow with whom he apparently has a story . Judd Hirsch plays against his image as a good man as a father who has triangulated his children and now stays with what he always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I enchanted myself with enchanting, sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as the director explains. <br /> <br /> This is an appropriate successor to the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized, Judd Hirsch was at it too!
