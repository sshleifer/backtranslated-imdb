Immediately after World War II, sound minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from the senseless flag that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "Best Years of Our Lives" and even "Gentleman's Agreement" investigated how Americans saw themselves after the war, but Delmer Daves' "Pride of the Marines" defeated them. The film is about alec John Garfield of Philadelphia who goes to war as a Marine and after a nightmare night in a trench with Japanese soldiers yelling at him and his friends " Mariiines, you die tonight! " hand grenade, and take off your girlfriend at home instead of having to depend on her after arriving home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is inflexible in his depiction of these men who are brave, so to speak, almost by coincidence. They are there in the trench, and when thrown, they react, both for heroism, but they do the work, and then comes self-pity, dark and dark sense of humor. of his blindness and the film makes no apologies, "There is no candy for anybody in this world," as his friend tells him. Ame guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, recalls: "In a war somebody understands, and you're it ... Everyone's got problems! When I come back, some guys will not hire me because my name is Diamond." Great films are made with courage like these, and if the first half hour of 'Pride of the Marines' does not rise completely to the occasion, it then evolves into a true work of art. You cry, and you think, you suffer and wait against hope. Well, simply: art. <br /> <br />
