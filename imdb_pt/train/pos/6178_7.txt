Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature as director, and he shows his versatility in directing a musical, after his previous films are heavy dramas. He also touches a tip as the master. <br /> <br /> You can say it's a prior-code movie, and nothing like it was done in the US for a long time afterwards (like over 30 years). Leisen filmed the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no panoramic photos or top wing Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never really see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the leads are quite characterless, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie people. Gertrude Michael, however, provides a bit of sparkle. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and some good (the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is fun) but the unconvincing and false drama - three murders are many and minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been so much better.
