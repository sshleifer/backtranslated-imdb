No day passes without a new computer animation movie released, so now we really have a chance to see more than a few good effects. After watching Ice Age I felt that it was not a big impact for me than some other movies of that genre. <br /> <br /> But it's because I'm a Big Guy now, and I'm sure this is a very nice movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is very simple, and the "actors" are funny in a cute way, with no coarse or complex humor. Even the "evil" is adorable, cute big cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointment to me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way), but it's a great thing for kids. And in addition to some fights nobody dies (not even when he is trampled by a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoon feel. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is cool, but nothing special, plus some really cool cartoon feeling scenes when you feel like walking into a good painting or comic pages. <br /> <br /> There were a few gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy these adults - but they are hard to detect and (in my opinion) better is not perceived, since it does not seem to fit the story. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a good movie, but it's in the Disney World-and-Fluffy-Animals-for-Children clich√©. If you do not hate cute animals doing funny things, watch it at least once.
