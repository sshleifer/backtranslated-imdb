It seems that even the director does not like this movie, but for me I think he's being a little hard on himself. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not perfect, but it has some atmospheric scenes, and the story is good enough to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> It is filmed in what appears to be a beautiful village that also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies shot in England I just saw a trailer for the director's latest movie 'The Devil's Chair', which seems quite surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not enough horror in English. movies for me, so anyone who comes along deserves our attention, and this is not as bad as you may think
