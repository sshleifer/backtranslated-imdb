CITY HALL is a little messy bag. Vignettes part of New York's political life and part moralizing tale. Al Pacino, a Dukakis style boss with presidential dreams, often performs moody or depressed. There are a few times when it chews the landscape and in the case of CITY HALL, it is where it shines. John Cusack gives a submissive and generally impeccable performance, without entering the caricature of a dialect of New Orleans, or entering the melodrama during the climax of the film. Danny Aiello as political boss, is also very good. I also love showtunes. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL, and is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of lack of momentum. It looks more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or we follow the story from an unbiased perspective and, of course, the viewer does not get involved. When the viewer does not get involved, to some extent he becomes apathetic about the characters and eventually the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to alienate, and what should have been a fascinating and detailed final breakdown. , came out as a "Hmmm ... uh ... ok". They say you "can not fight in the city hall," as the clich√© used says. However, this still can not stop you from thinking about what it might have been if they had just adjusted the script and the pace of that movie.
