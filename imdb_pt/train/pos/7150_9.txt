What a great movie! This is so reminiscent of the wonderful classic movies of the Disney family of the 60s and 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised after the last 20 years of absolute debris that Disney's live production teams produced. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. Children's stars were just that; professional actors and quality. I am very impressed with the quality of this film. Sigourney Weaver was an insolent hyperbole here leading a prison camp for rebellious boys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother. <br /> <br /> I will not portray the story here, since there is little sense in doing it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was excellent! This work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without getting all sugary or being too dark. The deleted scenes presented in the DVD version were actually better excluded. They were too hard for this movie and would have taken too much of it. While the abuse was suggested in the finished product, it was not shown to some extent. It was better this way. <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely delightful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> He gets a 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Devil:
