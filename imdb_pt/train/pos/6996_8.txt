This movie was really a great movie about something that affects all of us. I know that I personally come across this many times. Thank God, Will Smith jumped on the social issue of texting while driving. People, do not do that. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough time for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater watching the message and threw their phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to turn off all text messages on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, have them watch this vital public service announcement on texting while driving or they can kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
