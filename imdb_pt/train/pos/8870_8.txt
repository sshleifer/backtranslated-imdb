When John Singleton is on, he is * in * !! And this is one of your best movies. Not as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to him (and with much of the same star cast). This film was very well written, very well placed and very well filmed. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example: where did Fudge get money for 6 years of college and many expensive things? No mention of a rich history ... And why Professor Phibbs does not And while we're at it, for an engineering student, country man or not, Remy is a pretty dumb character - I think he would have a little more in the way of basic intelligence - he speaks and acts like a total clown). <br /> <br /> But other than that, the movie was very sharp. A good variety of characters and points of view; and Singleton does not take advantage of the story - many of the characters are not friendly, and he does a good job of interweaving the scenes of the Panthers and Supremacy together to show the madness on both sides. <br /> Much of the cinematography was excellent; I particularly loved the scene in which Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne, each scene matched nicely. In addition, the scenes of Malik / Deja were also well filmed. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was sometimes a little too much; this film had a tendency to get really lazy sometimes and also tended to pound the points it was making on its head when the dots would be so clear without the roughness (we really did not need the US flag with 'UNLEARN' typed , give us some credit, we're not idiots ...). And on top of that though * most of the time Singleton uses melodrama very well, sometimes it gets * very * cheezy (like Deja's death, which is fine until she screams 'WHY !!!' that just ruined everything the effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the acting, in general, was the top of the line. Ost Epps' fabulous performance (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act), Michael Rapaport (surprised the hell out of me ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls I thought he was a actor of a role), and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * remarkable. Disadvantage? Jennifer Connelly was flat; though not entirely her fault: her role was stereotyped and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was nothing less than horrible. She moaned and whimpered and whimpered. Yet another on the long list of models who have become actresses who failed miserably (though there are some who prove the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow!! An incredible soundtrack (worth buying!) That fits the movie like a glove. Each scene has a twin song (though Tori Amos's songs have started to really bother me to the end ... not their best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can you go wrong ?? <br /> <br /> All in all: a good watch, a very strong cast, great script, great movie. 8/10
