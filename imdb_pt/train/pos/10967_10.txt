I saw this movie for the first time in my theater and playwright course in Tulane. I was impressed by how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is a sincere look at the unprecedented reality of a life of solitude. The family is fascinating and I thought it really showed Little Edie at its core. ** As a side note My teacher even told me that during filming, Little Edie fell in love with one of the camera men. ** Beauty, I think, comes from the naturalness of family dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that none of them could function alone in society and you begin to desire the rehabilitation of Little Edie to society. In short, the film is thrilling in its aesthetic quality and is depicting the amazing beauty. Two thumbs up!
