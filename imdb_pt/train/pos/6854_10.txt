The smart, elegant and attractive thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is firmly among his best films! <br /> <br /> When a troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins a prostitute to discover the killer. Dressed to kill left a strong impression on the audiences of her day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setting and builds into a harrowing mystery filled with strong suspense. The ending and conclusion are especially 'nightmare'. It is a real plus of your most shocking seat. Even more impressive is the elegant direction of De Palma which gives this film not only a tight suspense but also a unique and somber atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic movie, but mostly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a beautiful soundtrack to the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is another striking feature of the film. Michael Cain makes a great turnaround as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a street walker involved is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy defender as the son investigator. <br /> <br /> Many criticize De Palma's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any resemblance between Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be seen as good quality, since calling this movie "robbery" would be degrading to a great thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all movie fans. out of ****
