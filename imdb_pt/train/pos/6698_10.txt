I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen all the episodes. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for him to show up on Nickelodeon, however, when Sabrina dropped out of high school, the show started to come down. The best series has to be when she's friends with Valerie (I do not know which one is). From there, the next series (Dreama's friends) was still very good, but when she dropped out of high school, it did not seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that she did not have as much of the old "brightness", however the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when the aunt leaves and Sabrina moves in your home is not right. She's no longer a teenager so the name of the show is not right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show does not seem right, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone who is not Harvey. Thank God he came in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. After all, I still love watching the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers went too far and should have left her with Sabrina out of high school. Because after that the show definitely lost some of the magic
