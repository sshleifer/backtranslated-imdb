I thought this was an amazing movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Also, the film was very creative. I think the whole performance was well done, the actors interpreted perfectly the personalities of their characters. Everything fit in well. It's really a shame that the band is not a soundtrack. That would have been great! Because this is a Canadian movie, and because it's one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10!
