Butch the peacemaker? Of course. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry moving away from each other, Butch interrupts and wants to know why. It is a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get on with dogs, can not they?" He asks Tom, who nods in agreement. "Rats can get on with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no," and then sees that is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They come in and Butch makes a "Peace Treaty" (complete with professional art!). Most of the rest, and most of the cartoon, is that the three are extremely sympathetic to each other. What a refreshing change of pace. I found it fun to watch. I can make a million of these cartoons in which each one hits the head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew peace would not last. A large piece of steak spells death from the "peace treaty" but on the way it was nice change and even had some of Tom and Jerry's usual clever humor.
