This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, so he rents the family that lives where he thought it was his family. OK? This is an excellent high school soap, PG-13, but the small sexual references are comedies, so if your child can not deal with them, they can not live in the real world. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a hottie, and as usual go for that joke, OMG, remember when we did ..., set piece as if he were in the final stages of some neuroinfectious disease . But that's fine, because even this ancient Oracle hopes that if Ben is well-distributed, well, there's still hope for us ladies. Fortunately, the rest of the group - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fills and keeps alternately hilarious, comfortable and warm this Christmas from Ozzie and Harriet. This movie is the kind you can skip and get popcorn, and when you come back, everyone wants to back up to show what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is a happy movie after all, and it leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
