I still liked that. Warren Beatty is just like the comic book hero. What saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and it's a mediocre script. I really expected something more substantial in terms of action, or plot, but I got very little. The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars of Hollywood at the time in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and did not even belong to this movie was Madonna. She does not belong to this movie and her acting work was very bad. The film in some places was stopped. You expected something more and you did not get anything. Al Pacino plays a very bad guy and he does very well. He and Beatty are excellent good and bad. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film different from Isthar. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is that it's good, but it could have been a lot better. I liked it when I was a kid because I thought it was cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are amazing, the writing is fair, and with a cast like that in the movie I would expect a little better anyway. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought the end was not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a great movie I thought it might have ended with a bit more of a bang. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only the 7 colors of the comic, making everything even more visually excellent. <br /> <br /> The costumes and makeup were also impeccable. The facial makeup for the villains was great. Beatty is not just as big a character as life. Still, this is a good movie that could have been so much more. It's better for me than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came about around the same time. Of course the film was much bigger gross.
