"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, which is not only a comedy but also an action anime. The main character in the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who also specializes in martial arts Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both parents who are great friends and trained together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most violent. Tendo's sister: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the medium and loves to make money, no matter what. Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially since both have a bad temper, and when they find out that Ranma becomes a girl when sloshed with cold water, just as her father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations begin to happen. They also discover the reason for the transformation: while fighting, Ranma and his father fell into a cursed river, but not only did they have that kind of fate ... <br /> If you watched '' Ranma 1/2 '' and liked it, I recommend '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku '', two other good creations from the hands of Rumiko.
