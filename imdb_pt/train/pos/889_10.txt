This is one of Hong Kong's best movies (action) and has a tense and thrilling plot as well as great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well. It's the only martial arts film that interested me in the plot, instead of just waiting for the fights. Sammo fans- This is a must see (See also Eastern Condor, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter Fat Dragon.
