I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The movie is not great, but it has many great elements. The lighting and the scenes along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and faint but fun. The acting is bad, but it's not worse than what you'll find on SyFy Channel. The music is very good and the blood is good. He has the great Leather Face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the entire movie and while predictable, it was still enjoyable. Women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being meditative and scary. The film was remarkably clean for a modern movie and violence appropriate for children aged 13 or over. There were no scenes of sex. I gave 7 out of 10 and I think that's fair. I would watch again if I had nothing better to do. The gay sonic angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil is pretty scary.
