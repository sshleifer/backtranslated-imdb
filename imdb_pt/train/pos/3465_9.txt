I sat down to watch this movie with much apprehension and little hope. I did not think that it would be possible for this movie to come to fruition. But absolutely did, and then some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon. At times, it seemed Harris was channeling Lennon. The resemblance was often strange, and he clearly studied Lennon's mannerisms and vocal inflections. Aiden Quinn was very good as McCartney, also with a striking resemblance to Macca, though occasionally stumbled in Scouse's accent. <br /> <br /> This work of fiction was well written and well directed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peering through the keyhole of that meeting. The roof scene was especially moving, for McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child-that he was dignified and important, and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents. I also liked the scene in the park where the two danced with absolute abandon for the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be: I'm not so sure that John was as caustic as he portrayed in the film at this stage of his life. He had established himself very well in his domestic situation, and he was known to be quite friendly when approached by fans. Just a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his killer for an autograph the day he was murdered. <br /> <br /> This film served mainly to stir those feelings again about what could have happened. If John had lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would have come back together sometime. And I'm sure Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I'll watch again and again. <br /> <br />
