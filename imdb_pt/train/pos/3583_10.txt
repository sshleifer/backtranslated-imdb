This was a great movie, but it had the worst ending I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and showed a wonderful talent. The whole story was distorted and unexpected, which is what made it fun. As good as the movie was, the whole movie is judged by the end, which was terrible! Maybe a sequel can eliminate this bad ending.
