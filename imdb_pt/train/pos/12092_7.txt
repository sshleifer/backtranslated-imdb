I remember for the first time seeing this in the 70's when it was shown on late night television. It scared me a lot. But then, I was a teenager back in those days, not as tired of movies as I am now. CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the Italian horror genre of the 1960s, along with Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960), the Curse of the Living Dead (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and CASTLE OF NIGHTMARE (1965) by Mario Caiano. If you want a scary atmosphere along with good writing, then check it out too. I also rate them along with the first Poe films that Roger Corman was doing during the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French print and is a big improvement over the old e-scan printing that was making the rounds on television over the years. It adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that do not add much to the movie as a whole, but it's good to see it complete, uncut. Unfortunately the DVD offers no extras beyond the stills of the movie. <br /> <br /> A flub I noticed was in the opening scene, watching the smoke-man next to the camera being reflected in the glass of the front door of the inn. I think the editors did not understand at the time, or maybe they did not care, but it's something I did not realize the first time. Those are the wonders of the DVD. You get to see all the flubs, bugs and details that were not apparent the first time. But it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But, never mind, you still get a 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
