I liked this movie and I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I'm in my fifties and I have many friends in the music world ... who are still trying to become adults now ... there are no more fans, groupies, money, etc ... and they are having a hard time adjusting for a living normal ... as they see the new bands, etc getting the spotlight ... it's almost as if they have to start over ... this movie is a testament to what many of the old rockers of the 70's and 80's are going through now ... and that's where I find the movie sad and depressing. But it portrays the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost - in a believable way. The young lady who arrives at her decrepit house reminds me of Hollis Maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she's a lady in a movie you're going to cheer up. This film is mandatory for 50-year-olds who saw the rise and fall of bands, people who knew members, and watched them hurt with the advancing age, and popularity disappears. This is a near perfect movie ... .but in a positive way ... because of the whales. A MUST SEE!
