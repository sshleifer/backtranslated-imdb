I just watched this movie for the second time on television. It's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I've rarely seen actors more able to reveal by their movements and gestures of love for another - Cyb Pastor, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply surpasses. Masterson probably has the toughest role and is just adorable. The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies, such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, and the "high gimmick" movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got married. I hate to say that because this cast was great and I would never change any of them, but I think it did not succeed, like the films mentioned above, because the cast's box office appeal was not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the film was made. <br /> <br /> It is not superbly written - for example, the lines of the characters are not particularly memorable. Still runs to perfection. <br /> <br /> Romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the "feeling" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, the timelessness of love and sweeping sweep, the sense of loss and desire to recover that connection, are so touching delivered. Again and again, you will be thrilled. In fact, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> Look at this - it's lovely.
