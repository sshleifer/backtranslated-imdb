From what I understood, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous cat. 3 Hong Kong films have disappeared. At least until now, and what an incredible movie that is. I knew it was a difficult police drama, but to be the first cat. 3 I bought it recently, I was not sure what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian gunslinger goes to Hong Kong to overthrow the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. . It turns out that the judge made the arrangements for the killer because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all her money. All this is known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given. After the attack, the policemen locate the killer quickly, but, when trying to arrest him, several policemen and civilians are killed. He eludes the police and now the race is to catch the guy before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer the chance to catch their breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, as the killer proves to be very difficult to locate and knock down when they locate him. Along the way, the killer, trying to hide in a dump, finds a woman being raped and mistreated by a man. He helps her and saves her from the guy, and she convinces the killer to take her along with him on his escape. I loved this movie, it's like a roller coaster that keeps moving and moving at high speed, as one incident leads to another, and the police are sometimes as bad or worse than the killer. The acting is exceptionally good, and the shooting and photography location is breathtaking. There's no disappointment in this movie, not even with the very incredible ending. The end is unbelievable, and also an appropriate end to all action and violence. Yes, violence is brutal at times, but this is a criminal drama without any nonsense, it will wipe you out. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a more widespread version, including an R1 version, for sure. Great movie, highly recommended.
