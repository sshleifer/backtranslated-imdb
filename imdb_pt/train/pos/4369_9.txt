I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had a few twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" scored well above average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were many verbal strokes and urges to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordsmanship. I could give you several examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understood a rarely recognized principle. For a drama to succeed, it needs not just a hero, but a truly believable villain. If you do not have one, there is not much joy in cheering for the good guys. And "Rob Roy" does not have one but three - the Earl of Montrose, his henchman Kilairn and Archie. Nor are they one-dimensional villains, but totally polite and very unpleasant. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there's more dialogue, and the accents are a bit difficult, but it's a much smarter and subtle piece. (Like I said, I loved this movie!)
