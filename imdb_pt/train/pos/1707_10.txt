This movie is not for everyone. You're bright enough to get "this" or you're not. Fans of science fiction films that do not take themselves too seriously will definitely like this movie. I recommend this movie for those who can enjoy parodies and parodies. Everyone I recommended this movie to have liked. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you'll probably like this one. Voice characterizations are done in an ironic way, and the one-line characters fly fast and furious.
