Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at about the same time as the Challenger Explosion. What really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if it should, bring it out. I'm glad they did. I watched SpaceCamp for the first time in a drive-in movie. Which really improved the view a lot. <br /> <br /> While I was hearing about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of the others in the movie. So it was a big shock for me to find all those young people acting and acting very well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes where the kids were being shown how to act like a team. The scenes of the children being prepared for a trip they could only hope for. The actual launch of a spacecraft, of course, is news to us. However, this was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most precious films. Escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. After probably renting it for 30 to 40 times. I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it. Now if it only comes out on DVD. I'll probably have this forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
