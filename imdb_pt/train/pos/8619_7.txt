Firstly, I would say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my childhood, could not read the subtitles and thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and embrace your seven inmates, you may want to avoid this movie. That being said, having just watched the restored version of 137 minutes on DVD, I must say I enjoyed it, though not as much as at age seven (I remembered the ending). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the film that are worthy of criticism, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes both have some really comical moments, my favorite being the contrast between the scenes in the last 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music. For an action movie, there is a great focus on the personal histories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squadron as the tension of their time travels takes its toll. By the end of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing, when seven I thought the 'guff' relationship was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there is also a lot of gratifying and bloody action. , especially some epic battle scenes between the platoon and the hordes of warriors of the Shogun era. The creators of the film have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, let's say, humorous. I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say I still do. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers generally do not spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid changing the space-time continuum, they have high-caliber machine guns, mortars, launchers of rockets, a tank and a helicopter and they are keen to make feudal Japan of them. It's what I would like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots. <br /> <br /> In short, movies that are worth watching, make the viewer lament that there are no more movies made with a similar premise. , and at the same time offers some heavy tips on why a movie like GI Samurai is so unique.
