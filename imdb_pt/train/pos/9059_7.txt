This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch, if you have nothing else to do. If you are hoping that this movie is word for word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a bit disappointed that I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is a new kid in the town called Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, probably the worst part of the movie. Child actors exaggerate in many things. They think it's an apocalypse if Billy does not eat the worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job, though. <br /> <br /> The plot is good as a movie, but it is a drug of adaptation of the book. I could watch this movie without looking at the time ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good family movie with some weaknesses. I rate this movie 7/10.
