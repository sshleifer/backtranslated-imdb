Financially tied Paramount pulled all the stops for this stage adaptation 34 entry: big budget, great cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen marked as the director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for out of focus rock and a murder mystery script that did not deserve to be in the same garbage can as Charlie Chan's worst draft on the street. I have to believe that the cut was out of the hands of Leisen, since the number of the great Duke Ellington is chopped, but that does not mean it's not worth to take a look: the number of 'Sweet Marijuana' with girls topless crowns is a mind blower considering the impending production code and also has the sweeping Toby Wing (which unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype of blonde dumb) as a hot chorus for a worried Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's performance is bland as Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches new highlands as an idiot and stereotyped detective. And try to see Lucy in the chorus. This classifies a 7.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 Rethinking: Recently I took a closer look at the film and now I feel I was wrong to berate Busby Berkeley's lack of production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. I still have huge issues with editing though. Paramount, the most important studio in the city, faced huge problems with the Production Code at the worst possible time in its history, financially speaking, and removed all barriers to it (see also Search for Beauty magazine, 1934). A must see for pre-code buffs.
