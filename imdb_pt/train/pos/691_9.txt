I am going to clean. The only reason I found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is one of my favorite actors. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be ... different, maybe not so good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was really excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and received a few weeks later. Needless to say I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, an insomniac who is often plagued by conditions that lead him to doubt what reality is and what is in his head. I will not reveal what happens, but I'll tell you that the movie can sometimes be scary in its realism. <br /> <br /> The direction is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to miss out on any entertaining or thought-provoking moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this great movie 9 out of 10, by going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.
