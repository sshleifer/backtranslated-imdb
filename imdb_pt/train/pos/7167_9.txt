I could not help commenting after reading the very short review "Not Bad". This movie is so much better than just not bad. The acting is stellar, even from the children in the cast, who do not play cute or anything other than acting as my son's friends. The movie is smart and expects the audience to be too. The double lines of flash history are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than acting as time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and then watched it again a few days later. If you have children and are sick with the death of films that inspire a diabetic coma with its syrupy sweetness, then check out "Holes". My six-year-old daughter liked it as much as my 11-year-old daughter, and my husband and I liked her as much as both. How many movies can you say about that?
