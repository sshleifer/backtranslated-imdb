This movie was incredible ... it made me laugh, do crazy, and above all, there are animals talking about it !! this movie must be seen by all kinds of people! It's one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much I just had to comment on it !!! is so heart and a wonderful plot that makes a great and sincere movie! My favorite character is shadow. this is because I think he is the most interesting and charming. I used to have a golden retriever just like the shadow, I miss him so much !!! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart !! This movie is the best I love and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, enjoy them forever !!!
