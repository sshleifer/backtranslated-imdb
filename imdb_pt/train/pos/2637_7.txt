This is a straightforward movie for the video, so it should be said that it will not rival the first Lion King, but having said that, that was absolutely fine. <br /> <br /> My kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that * I * also liked it, it was funny in some parts (even the fart jokes *), had lots of very creative combinations with the first movie, and even some jokes you had to do. to be old enough to understand (but without being arrogant as in Shrek ["Do you think he's making up for anything?"]] <br /> <br /> A special note about fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact, there were almost no noises / pictures, references were very subtle), they had a / punchline / etc setup, and were almost tasteful.I wish my kids thought there's more humor than going to the bathroom, and that movie is good in those respects. <br /> <br /> Hmm, what else? <br /> The music was more or less as creative as in the first or second movie, but a lot of fun to a little action, but nothing too scary (the NIMH Secret gave my children nightmares, I'm not sure if the G rating was appropriate for that one. ..) <br /> <br /> In short, I would say this is great movie for children of any age, one that is 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive, but I had to skip and turn off the TV during some movies that were less kid-friendly than expected) - but you it is safe to leave the room during this time. I would say that staying close by anyway, you may find that you like it too :)
