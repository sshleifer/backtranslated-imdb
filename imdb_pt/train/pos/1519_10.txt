Given how cheesy these movies are, you have to imagine they should have fun doing it. The film focuses on a house that strangely accommodates those who live there. The inhabitants were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who is a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), about to enter a bit too much into the character. <br /> <br /> "The house that dripped blood" is worth being seen (well, duh; it's starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to being pure, there may be some tones: you may be questioning the issue of the actual horror versus the assumed horror. As in "The Enlightened One," we may ask if the house / hotel itself holds some remembrance of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! By the time she left, she also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - remains known only as a screaming queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT QUEEN OF CRIES! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-starring in something. <br /> <br /> I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Delfolm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of name is "Denholm"? Oh well. A really cool movie.
