Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably exaggerated (But he played similar parts in other films as "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent, but the film certainly "thrilled". <BR> Light spoiler ahead: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook has been strangled in her movies, but I do remember several other examples. I will avoid naming the killer, but I think it's necessarily obvious because of the demands of the thriller storyline. <br /> <br /> A very well made but dated noire movie (for example, everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters.) And no corpse was ever shown, unlike today's blood festivals .) made in the format of family short period tableaux of the period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
