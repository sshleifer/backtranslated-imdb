I'm a big movie fan and I saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say it was really very interesting. The two protagonists are amazing, the movie is never boring, and the concept behind it (though obviously inspired by the Columbine murders and the murderous home movies) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, like the final 20 minutes that really deviate from the realism seen in the first hour, and the ending really does not make any sense. Unstable camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the cinema is taken for granted. But I still think the film is very well done and director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
