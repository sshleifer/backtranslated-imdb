Walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts in the cinema. How can you laugh at the misery of other people and not start feeling bad when it happens for a long time? <br /> <br /> Well, this small and surprising gem of a movie will provide great laughter, beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz too. I particularly like the concept that a trick of history has made alcohol legal since white Europeans liked it and illegal marijuana, since 'those other races' used it ... no doubt true and exposes a racial side to marijuana laws so openly propagated by populations around the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary commentary on "Extra DVD" ... two of them, actually ... convey the whole movie with the two actors and then with the writers. I kept seeing things that I was sure were not in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it is to lose a lot of the subtle comedy in the first scene. What a joke! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
