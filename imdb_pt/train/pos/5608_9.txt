Of course, he quickly became uneven after that movie, but from "Knife In The Water" to "The Tenant," Roman Polanski has always been able to count on something fascinating and unique. Despite many running issues (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really alike. The story of this is somewhat similar to its own "Repulsion" of ten years before, but the tone is completely different. "The Tenant" manages to balance a darker than dark absurdity (I'm a bit hesitant to call it humor, even if the bizarre behavior of the protagonists and dialogues were occasionally funny) with a truly suspenseful paranoia. Polanski has always been a master at building discomfort, and the moments in this movie are almost unbearably scary. The overall strangeness of the film is also an advantage. <br /> <br /> In addition to the exquisite direction of Polanski as usual, the rest of the cast and staff offer great contributions. Polanski, the actor is often overshadowed by director Polanski, but his performance here really captures the strangeness of his characters and the feeling of being an outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness, because they are strangers. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially the understanding back of Isabelle Adjani, and the annoying Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters. "The Tenant" is often underestimated because of how much people are ready to praise both "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby," but it's as brilliant as any of these classics. (9/10)
