This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was happy to see William Powell dealing with a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). While the story is good by itself, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is the fantastically imaginative direction of Michael Curtiz. From a visual standpoint, this is a rich texture film, with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split-screen images to quirky camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of Hollywood's best directors. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of film.
