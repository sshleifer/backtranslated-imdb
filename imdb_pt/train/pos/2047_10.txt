This movie went home to me. At 29, I remember the 1980s and my father working in a factory. I figured if I worked hard too, if I was proud and never gave up, I could also have the American dream, the house, some kids, a car to call my own. However, I noticed that without a diploma in something (unlike my father who dropped out of ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It's made for TV, and I just saw it an hour ago. I can not find anywhere! I would love to show this to my friends, my pseudo-friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once the Americans would work to feel honor and that we were proud of what we accomplished !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a downward spiral with so many things being done abroad ...
