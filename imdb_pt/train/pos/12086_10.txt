Wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. Highly recommended for all ages from 9 years to grannies. Adorable piece of time that captures 1962. The story includes Garr, his two sons and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to survive without a man as head of the family. The "family" goes west to pick up the inheritance of a long-forgotten relative who left Garr, a roadside bar in the late 1940s. The tenacious Garr, as the sweet but determined mother, leads the whole family for the restoration and opening of the coffee. But wait ...... Aunt Zena is a former circus actress with tricks of cards, magic powders and a sense of humor of clowns ... she loves to leave the children and her in silly and sometimes dangerous games ... What happens next is a delightful combination of "Miracle at Lords" launched in conjunction with Cuban rocket attacks (with authentic TV news from the actual event) and a "phantom" prank that gets totally out of control. This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiosity and gives a bewildering view of the scary scare of the Cuban missile crises of October 1962. At the end, there remains the wonder of faith, the family and rediscovered love. Oh, and the music of the early 60's era is just great! <br /> <br /> Recommend EXTREMELY A MOVIE WELL SENSO 10 out 10
