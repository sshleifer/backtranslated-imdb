A second installment that can be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the cast is simply wonderful. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common except for wit and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode is very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. It's the first Christmas episode about a woman who is plagued by a serial killer dressed as Santa Claus after killing her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene is a tie between the murder of your husband and his phone call, first feigning his fear until it becomes real.
