A true shouting situation comedy farce from the mid 70's this movie was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I'm constantly amazed at some comedy movies that are a big release one week and then disappear: HIGH ANXIETY, THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT LOOK NOW WE ARE SHOT IN ......... and I do not have no profile today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in 1976 and everyone seemed to see, laugh and never mention it again. Famous for being filmed on videotape and transferred to the movies, an experience at the time, NORMAN is a shabby politically incorrect sturdy cabinet that The Farrelly Brothers should seek redo today. If they had done this in the first place, there would be no complaints about their content and inclination. It's very funny and very rude and hilarious all wrong. Just as it should be. In fact, like a 1976 movie with all these colors and horror outfits, it works better today.
