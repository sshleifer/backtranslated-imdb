A retro, nasty, ugly and nasty retro action thriller about a bodyguard determined to find (and destroy!) The murderers of the girl he should protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is not aware or does not care about 30 years of social advancement. I really do not think we'll see a more violent movie soon, so you better go see this movie while you can. Despite his relentless cruelty, I think the film is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative and effective. Scott has a hard sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are very effective for me to ignore. Scott's directing choices are simply astounding, and he performs well at Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this, but I have recommended it to viewers looking for a great action-packed movie.
