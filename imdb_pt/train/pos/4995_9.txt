I do not think most of us would tend to apply the term "unmissable" to action movies, but I was very impressed with how good this movie was and deservedly received the "must-have" stamp from me. Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin, a professional thief to help conduct a diamond robbery at a museum for a criminal syndicate. and be generously rewarded for it. Little did they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds), who were previously disdained by Mandy and Martin to get into the business, are also planning to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> As every pair of thieves plot the robbery is a thrill to watch. Things go wrong, as Martin and Mandy, unknowingly, find themselves one step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You'll find yourself cheering on these thieves when they find out they need each other to stay alive in the crime syndicate. Action fans will not be disappointed, as there is a healthy dose of battles with guns, martial arts and close combat. What's surprising is that it's not just the action that carries this movie, but the romance and laughter (and I do not mean that you're typical of a prevailing line in action movies) that sneak It's not easy to cheer on bad guys , but we can see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and a NO to lose! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
