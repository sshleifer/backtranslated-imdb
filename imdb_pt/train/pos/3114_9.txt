I'll keep this brief so I do not ruin anything for you. This movie is incredible. From beginning to end, it is filled with genuine emotions. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are captivating and move at such a pace that they actually only seemed slow to the end when things are explained, but that's only because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and really turned out to be a very solid actor, challenging him not to believe him in this role. He is that role. A welcome addition to the series on David Straithrain (I hope I spell so close to the right) as a CIA agent to kill the Bourne. This is non stop and will actually leave you at the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things to the end are just an absurd smosteron, thus denying a rating of 10. The ending is left open for the sequences and I hope you consider making more of them as none have been bad. Excellent movie on everything and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> Q. The unstable camera did not hurt any of the actions, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is that you only realize when people are talking and not so much the action.
