Heh, if I tell you to compare the Dark Knight to an 18-year comic book, rated at 5.9, will you call me crazy? This is just to get your attention. Every day I find people complaining that there are no good movies, which seem to know only the recent blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to research and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not be easily outdated in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative comments have mostly complained about DT's "disorderly" history. But it seems to me that the plot is very clear and I had no problem following it. I have not seen the comics, but I'm not a big fan of comics in the US, but I appreciate the cinema and the high-level performances. Perhaps the expectations of most people were very high on the story that would tell. But if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect? I had some scratches on the head, and I can not help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The title role, though not as competent as it seems, still managed to lure him and delight the audience. Madonna was more expressive than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigal to himself. Apparently he is bold enough to be sarcastic in his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro piercing our stomachs to make us laugh. And thank you very much for the makeup. <br /> <br /> For me, it's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really caught me.
