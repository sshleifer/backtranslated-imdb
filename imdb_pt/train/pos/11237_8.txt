Star Trek: The Hidden Frontier is a long-running Internet movie, made entirely for the love of the series, and a must-have watch for Trek fans. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you might say that it is green screen. This does not detract from the overall experience however. CGI ships are fantastic, as are the scenes of space battles ... On the downside, I could tell in previous episodes (and even occasionally in the younger ones) that some of the actors / actresses are not very comfortable in their scenes. roles, but again, this does not detract from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew have really created something special here, and as a whole I recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
