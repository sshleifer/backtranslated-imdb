I think this movie is a lot of fun and awful. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is very unfortunate that the second part of this wonderful film has not been successful, because it is very funny as a first part. I also regret that in addition to this movie I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she's an incredible actress with great ... potential. I hope I see you in the future in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can trust me. What else can I add? This is a cool and classic movie!
