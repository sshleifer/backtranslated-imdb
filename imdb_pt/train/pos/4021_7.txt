A complex story was placed at the bottom of Bharat's partition. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl and an educated Hindu who burns the crop of a Muslim man - but in the end you end up liking both. The story is powerful, but the script and the flow are hesitant. The background music score and the songs are excellent. Next comes the memorable performance of veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography captures the time, violence and taste of the rural Punjab countryside very well. Other actors either did not act well or had no chance to act. Direction is really the weakest link. The characters were not well developed. It is not sharp, in contrast to "the Earth," where even a 5-line character leaves a mark. The ending is very interesting. This story could have several different endings - and they could all have been equally good.
