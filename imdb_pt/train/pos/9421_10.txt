Contains * spoilers * - also, my quotes may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone always observes satire in social and economic parallel comments - as is true. But for me, I see this movie much more than that. I love the symbolism of that guy in a bright white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around you, but it will not stay. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to interpret this - his childlike smiles and eternal curiosity are so appropriate: "That's ingenious - can you tell me, what's the proportion of paint for gasoline?" > <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention did not work, after all, almost naked. However, more than shame is the simple disappointment that it "did not work". He is never intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we want to stop too." <br /> <br /> Just a moment of hesitation before he tries to run away again. Does it show any sign of the pain that such betrayal must have caused? No. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is Dapne's role. She is sick and tired of money and power. She thinks she has finally found love outside her father's company. At first, she does not care more about Sidney than anyone else. But that moment when he falls from her car and she comes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention. She finally found something that she thinks is worth living. The funny thing is that it's not even romance. It is friendship, but of such ephemeral nature that the title hardly fits. It's more admiration, and maybe even inspiration. After discovering that Michael has no love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her, she gives in to cynicism and tries to make it up. Sidney Fortunately she thinks there really are people in this world living for more than power, money and lust. What a refresh: "Thank you Sidney. If you had said 'yes' I think I would have strangled you" <br /> <br /> I love the ending, when all this crazy business seems to have come to nothing But then, the bubbling, peculiar beat begins and Sidney leaves, his step corresponding to the melody: fearless. Where is Daphne? We really do not know - but they were not really in love and she was not really a scientist. He got help to escape and she had "a shot in the arm of hope". (Pollyanna) A continued relationship would have been good, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I expected ..." <br /> <br />
