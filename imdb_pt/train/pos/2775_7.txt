Old movie fans will know why I would call this movie "The Man in the Gray Flannel Robe". Most Bible-based movies are basically a shock - which can provoke smiles and laughter here is how Peck tries to raise awareness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying Neanderthals on him. Like a Great Romance, it falls like unleavened bread. But there is something interesting about this movie. Of all the great pictures of the Bible in Hollywood, the most striking is the average American's ambivalent attitude toward belief in the God of the Bible. Billy Sunday's thesis is being discussed with the antithesis of H.L. Mencken throughout the script. Whoever gets the best of it in the synthesis supported by the Divine Choir depends on his point of view. In addition, D & B has a good performance by Peck (especially in the final repentance scene) and by Jayne Meadows as his first bitter Michol wife, vivid and moody atmosphere (good idea to set most of the action at dawn or night), and the engrossing interpretation of the Twenty-third Psalm at the end.
