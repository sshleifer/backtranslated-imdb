This is not a "loose" but accurate, faithful remake of the 1958 Monicelli classic "I Soliti Ignoti" with Toto ', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that's the reason it's good, it copies all the funny characters and the plot, even in detail (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I watched the great old version many times and I knew by heart all the gangs and the end but I still liked "Welcome to Collinwood" which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how life and the ways of the little thieves in Italy in the 1950s are adapted to the US of 2002. Things have not changed much. 8/10
