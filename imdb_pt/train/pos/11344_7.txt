Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in the movies at the age of 4 and I have very loving and vivid memories of it. Seeing this as an adult, you can pick up references that are well above the target audience - like the part where Jimmy's gray wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel (Cass) mocks "I KNEW she had brown roots!" Of course, it is strongly influenced by the culture of the flower power of the time and, to a certain extent, quite progressive. The Different Track, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers about being yourself, not running with the pack, and valuing what is about yourself that is different. This could be a hymn to the gay community, it should be, great way. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches, and the cast of Living Island gives it all limits to their character outfits (including Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names) . There's a lot of acting in this movie - there really is nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to demonstrate his concern for the abducted residents of Living Island, it's little more than screaming. This is drama and comedy scattered with a spatula. As I think about it - I could never stand the flute though. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, especially the aforementioned different, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even wild touch of Jack Wild If I Could. In addition, it is now on CD of the tasteful people of El Records in London. See here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
