Excellent show. Instead of watching the same kind of old sitcom shows where the same thing is, just different "stars", this refreshing show provided an incredibly fun view of office situations. We stayed away from watching any television for 2 years and after returning, of all the shows available, we look forward to watching this show at W. Shame on Global to take the plug on this one. I thought this would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, LITTLE Canadian shows do that. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe it was a foolishness for Global to step aside. I think they want to stick with the typical narcotics shows of the United States mind, instead of getting behind a Canadian show that had a lot of promise. Do not get me wrong, I like many shows on TV, but come on, let's keep the variety. This unique show provided a very comical insight into a somewhat over-priced realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters you do not see on any sitcoms today or in the past. Too bad the world had to say no to this, a foolish mistake.
