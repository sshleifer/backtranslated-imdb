I saw this movie a week ago and I keep thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very credible and friendly almost to a fault. As in real life, although sometimes people disappoint, as was the case with Leo, that although I liked his character, I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex, while fully aware of his condition of HIV. I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the remedy available to him, and the horrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him back home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are high in young gay men. This is by no means to end gays (I'm gay) and the movie might very well have been done about a heterosexual young woman who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to herself and others. The only part of the film that I could not understand was why the family (gay friendly) was unwilling to include Marcel in Leo's illness, to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message of this movie is that, whether gay or straight, DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE SEXUAL!
