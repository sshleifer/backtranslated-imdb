"World's Finest" is a unique project. It's a trailer for a Superman / Batman crossover movie that does not exist and will never exist, at least not in this way, with these characters, actors and plot anyway. <br /> <br /> So the film is a big provocation, even more so than the daily movie trailers. The trailer will cheer you up for nothing. In that regard, I really did not like this short project. By watching this trailer you get hungry and excited by more and at the same time sad - and maybe you even feel cheated later, when a full movie of this trailer will never exist. More or less makes you wonder why this project was done in the first place. Certainly to show off the skills of Sandy Collora, but he also could not have done it with a real movie, like his previous film "Batman: Dead End." <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this short purely for what it is, then from the technical point of view of the cinema, it's really great. It's great and a lot more professional than you think at first, although people who have seen "Batman: Dead End" already know better than to expect a short one with cardboard, cheap homemade clothes and third party clothes. rate actors. The short is not constantly impressive and obviously the budget was not very high, but most of the time it is very impressive and professional, with costumes, scenery, special effects, cinematography and pleasant lighting. <br /> <br /> Short has a nice quick and typical trailer, perhaps with a bit too much hard-to-find shots, but works well for the style of the trailer. It has some awesome shots, but also a couple of lame ones, especially the Superman flight sequences. It was obvious that the guy was standing in a moving car, with a camera pointed at him from an angle below. I even thought it was a ridiculous thing to see. But really the best and most spectacular moments really make up for it. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn looked like a good Superman / Clark Kent, although he obviously is not the best talented actor out there. Clark Bartram reprises his role in Batman again and Kurt Carley looked like a great Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast also served its purpose well. <br /> <br /> It is especially interesting to watch this short after the recent modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this film, in the films "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare the style and treatment of characters from these films with this one. It's really amazing and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and well built trailer that, however, leaves you hungry for more, even knowing there will be no more. What happened to Waner Bros. Are you planning to create a complete Superman / Batman movie by the way? I thought the developments were in progress a few years ago, but nothing has been heard since. Instead, two new separate films from Batman and Superman were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> 7/10
