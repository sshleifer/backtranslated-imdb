NR Rated (Rated R for Pervasive Strong Language and Crude Sexual Humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first stand-up comedy.This came out in 1983. He then starred in the film 48 hours and Trading Places and he was on Saturday Night Live.Eddie made two stand up comedy films.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the subject to be more humorous.Delirious however is also very funny with Eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. Anyone fan of comedy movies stand up should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
