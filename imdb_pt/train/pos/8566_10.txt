I really like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I found it fantastic but I think 101 is better because I think it's funnier, more humor, and also that movie was based in the same story as the cartoon version (1961) I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope so, maybe yes, maybe not, all dalmation fans will have to find out if there will be 103 dalmations in the future.
