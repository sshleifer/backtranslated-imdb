I found the first and only comment about this entirely non-informative and totally stern movie, so I decided to write my own. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and picked up a few more times since then. First of all, let me say that, in general, the things that make this movie RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It does not matter that you have some quirks of low budget and other flaws. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliantly wrong scene. The film is about the kind of humanizing catalysis that Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The script and the dialogue are strong and give due attention to the customs and inflections of time. Overall, what's not to like? Also, name another movie in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life?
