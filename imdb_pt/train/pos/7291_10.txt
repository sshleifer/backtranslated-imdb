When you usually watch a short film, you are always afraid that the person who is creating the movie will try to play it too hard. That is not the case with this one. A great story about a young woman who has had enough and other forces in the world trying to help her do the right things. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of distorted justice and helps convey the intricacies of the world. blurred line of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both the girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short, but Eric's performance is definitely the one that most deals with this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for its complexity, performance and excellent on the whole story.
