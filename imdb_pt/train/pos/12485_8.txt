I watched this movie and I have to say that I was very impressed. It is very scary and has several moments that will make you jump from the bank! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that maybe there were many jumping moments. It came to a point where every new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore off the amazing effect because you kind of was new. <br /> <br /> Although it contains practically all the cliches of the ghost genre, All went so well that they kept the fear scary. He had elements of The Illuminated, The Sixth Sense and The Pun (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of the Troco). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an old-fashioned scare!
