I do not want to annoy everyone, reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone has the good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it's on DVD !!!! I ran to the store and got a copy and I'm happy to say it's as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and scary character, and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network has not continued. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who likes the genre and has not seen, should do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to watch it when she was on TV (she's 20), is getting very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds it "very distorted" and liked the episodes she saw. I can not wait to see the episodes that did not air. <br /> <br /> This show rocks !!!!
