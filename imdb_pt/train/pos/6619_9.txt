Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), City of Lost Children (heightened senses or whatever is used and abused and mostly, well, only giving us much less than we could dream), and <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> This really should be added. <br /> <br /> For a while, I've been waiting for an animated movie that could affect as much as Miyazaki's stuff. This is the first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "lively" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with the film noir and, hey, if you do not leave, it should be mostly love, right? But, there are so many science fiction and noir themes totally submerged in this movie that it's just a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> These people did an incredible job!
