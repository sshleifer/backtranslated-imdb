I had not laughed much about a movie in a long time. I have to go to an advanced selection, and I was thrilled because I was dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes because of a lot of laughs throughout the movie. The whole audience shared my laughter, and was clapping and screaming for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Steve Carrell (whom I had been a fan of). He proves in this film his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there was not a special guest of Will Ferrell (love him, but I saw him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were parts of the comic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks to the writing (also Carrell). The epilation scene and the speed doubler with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely see '40 Year Old Virgin 'when it's released. My advice: go see him for big laughs and an incredibly nice movie on top of him.
