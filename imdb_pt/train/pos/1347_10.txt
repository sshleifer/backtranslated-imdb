Huge, exhausting and passionate summary of American cinema seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. It goes without saying that there is never a moment of boredom in all its 4 hours in duration. Many genres, periods and directors are examined, discussed more from the perspective of the cinephile than from the contemporary director. For anyone, even remotely interested in American movies, or movies in general. A masterpiece and the best of BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
