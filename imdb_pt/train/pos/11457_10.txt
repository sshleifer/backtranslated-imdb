As the jacket proclaims, this film is "beautifully filmed and masterfully edited," and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful. The timelessness we perceive in the stoic rock and in the incessant flow of water shapes the ephemeral works of Goldsworthy's hands, so that in their ephemerality they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of their compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy - or in the words of Matthew Arnold of "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! you hear the grating roar Of stones that the waves pull back, and fling On your return, raising the high thread, Begin and quit, and then again begin, With cadence trembling slowly, and bring The eternal note of sorrow. At one point near the end of the movie, Goldsworthy says, "Words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more." As a writer of words, I do not offend and for a moment I consider him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy creates meticulously and intuitively is in fact something more than mere words can say . At another point, he remarks: "What is here to stay ... and what is not." That's your theme. <br /> <br /> I think artists, sometime in the twentieth century, have become aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast extent of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing deliberately ephemeral works. The idea was that, emphasizing how ephemeral are the most powerful works of human beings, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is of this kind. of expression. He meticulously composes some form of straw or leaves, where the tide will reach it, or place it in the river, where it will be swept away; and in this process the composition and its ephemerality merge. <br /> <br /> Both the transient and the timeless are needed to understand our world and our place within it. And it is important that these works be done within the context of nature, so that what is composed is defined within what is natural. Thus the stone walls and stone eggs that Goldsworthy builds are silent and solid, but we know that they are not monuments for eternity but will remain for some indefinite time and then dissipate and return to a state similar to that which existed before of appearing. <br /> <br /> This is art as art should be, similar to spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Goldsworthy's work is a disjointed understanding. It is a purely time and form experience. In a sense, his work "responds" to Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias," even when the tide washes the work, and even when the river dissipates expression, yet art is still alive because of our experience. Likewise, one thinks of the Tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured, and then, just as they are beautifully and beautifully finished, they are given to the wind, so that we may know that all is flow. <br /> <br /> However, in the modern world, these works of art linger on photos and videos. Goldsworthy is a talented photographer (by necessity, I would say) and all his unsuccessful works, he tells us, are photographed so he can look at them in a more reflective way and see what he has accomplished and what he has done it was not. <br /> <br /> This film production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately astonishing music of Fred Frith is not to be missed. It's one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
