So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy from the store, he said it sounded like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, as Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 1970s at the height of its popularity at a major rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members are struggling to make a living, and the opportunity is offered to play a concert on the twentieth anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and decide to retire permanently, traversing Europe in the process. Some funny jokes follow, and all the characters undergo subtle changes. Watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer than a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
