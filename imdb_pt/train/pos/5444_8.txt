Class reunion is a very understated comedy gem. It is 1982 and the 1972 class of Lizzie Borden High returns there for 10 years of meeting, among them are the usual stereotypes, the piece, the cat, the fat and the nerd etc, but the alumni are on a bumpy night, one of the his classmates are Walter Baloer, the class coward who has been subjected to a comedy joke by the rest of the gang on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation, "" <br /> Despite the gloomy premise, this is just an excuse for many funny jokes and scenery pieces. Saying a lot more would spoil the movie, but if you liked the Naked Gun & Airplane movies, you'd love that, and what other movie does Chuck Berry have? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
