Like I said at the top, four stars are not enough. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. For people who do not really like or understand, you should not have a real appreciation for the art, or you may have little attention. <br /> <br /> Even though I have not seen all of his films yet, I have to say that this is Spielberg at his peak. It is very sad to see that films as good as "The Color Purple" do not come up very often because I think we are all in a desperate need for world-class cinematic entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> Films like this are more than just movies; are pieces of art that need to be most appreciated. <br /> <br /> The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars (even the Best Picture of the Year) and did not receive a trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be at times. Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Director! I should have swept the Oscar that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair life is to some people. <br /> <br /> If only the movies were still good ...
