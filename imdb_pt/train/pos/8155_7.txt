I'm too old to know (or care) exactly what the difference is between rap and hip-hop. And being Canadian, it's likely I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought this movie was very funny when I saw it, a brilliant satire. Hip-hop culture is so widespread these days that it's hard not to keep hearing about it over and over again. (If only we could say the same about the bagpipe music). I got the most jokes (at least I think I did). Of course, it is derived from Spinal Tap, but there are many targets that could withstand a Tap treatment. Just not carpenters, they are sacred.
