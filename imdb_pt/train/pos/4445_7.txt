This old Sirk melodrama, filmed in black and white, is a smaller film but shows the talent of the German director in highlighting the tired stories in something like art. Set in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who sinned by abandoning her husband and small-town family by luring the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and is drawn back to the city she left by an anxious letter from her daughter informing her that she also liked the theater (a college production, of course). Back in her old town, she is once again stingy, and has to deal with her hostile, startled (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and former lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk differentiates himself by creating meaningful compositions, with each frame carefully filmed, and he is aided immensely by having Stanwyck as his protagonist. It runs about 76 minutes, and that's good, because the material does not have legs to go further.
