I have seen it in an elegant movie theater, where the public is usually white, educated and urban. The exhibition I watched had a hint of African-Americans, and made a difference in the public reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. Basically, the white guys were scared to laugh or laugh nervously at the funny parts - and there are many! - because they would be "laughing at the blacks" while the blacks would also be silent because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, being Asian (and therefore not belonging to any group), I had a great time seeing this satire of rap culture and its egos / traps / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophies. The cast is talented and does a great job of becoming the characters portrayed. The songs are too funny to be believed. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to feature, including "A Mighty Wind".
