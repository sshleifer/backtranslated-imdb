This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, cleverness, great performance and a good dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie and was drawn to the original storyline (based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, which I'm now looking to read) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things to me, in fact, was how much the story is self contained. Unlike so many science fiction fantasy films out there now that leave the audience open and such, this was a pure fairytale, satisfying in itself, without the need for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Fantasy of well-being.
