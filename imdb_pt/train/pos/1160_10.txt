It is funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man, this is funny. Kline and Fields are great. Kline is running to the door after assessing Teri Hatcher - great too!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work seamlessly together - even he finds out who she really is ... a soap opera if there's only one! <br /> <br /> The scene near the end in the Chinese dining room had my kids and me rolling on the floor - that scene is only worth the rent. <br /> <br /> It does not solve any problem in the world or shows what appears to be daytime TV (I hope). Just great fun.
