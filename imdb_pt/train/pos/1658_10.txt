If you've ever seen this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and I have to shamefully admit that we (PR) are living in a real mess now, drugs being the main reason for the shootings and murders we have almost every day. These people will shoot at anyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of it. We do not feel safer, and moreover, our so-called "righteousness" is no longer driven by truth and correction, but by money, influence, and power. "Ladrones y Liriosos" is based on real, deplorable facts, and really portrays the three main problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related deaths, money and power manipulating our courts, and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of of this. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their realistic plot and award-winning direction (**), were brave enough to present all this as badly as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country living in a nightmare that does not seem to end !! ! ** They recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director at the World Cinema Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
