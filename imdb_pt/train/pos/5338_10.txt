If I'm going to watch a porn movie, I'd rather have some kind of plot and a dialogue of descent. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few that I came across with these attributes. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door criticizes the human nature and the weaknesses of the neighbor, that involved seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the actress chosen to play the seductive blackmailer, and plays the role magnificently. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie is a total of 10 just because it's in it. Her partner in the movie, Monique Alexander, is definitely cute. The two should work together more. In this film, though, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. This is bad. She seems to have more talent to be shared. I like the girl who was the wife of (possible) DA after. I forgot her name, but she's very pretty, not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. Obviously there are parts of it bought and paid for. Which is right, but is it over? Sorry, but let's go! I'm afraid her performance here has fallen in the rankings some, except that Chelsea's talent and beauty replace any negatives. Overall, this movie is good.
