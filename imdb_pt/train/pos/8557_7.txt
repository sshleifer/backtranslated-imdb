I have to hand it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" movies. "Direct To DVD" is typically synonymous with cheap and incompetent film. Last year, I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the continuation of the DVD "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers seized the opportunity to produce a little sassy and funny movie. This year they offer follow up, "Beta House". This is the honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first "American Pie" movies look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> This is not a noisy, tasteless, laughter-free grace. Of course, the story is a little thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes, we're introduced to all the main characters, the new supporting characters, we get a handful of raunchy jokes, we meet the villains and we set the general plotline. With all of this out of the way, the movie becomes an unlimited ride. The jokes are very, and they were not contained in that. I'm talking about male semen, urine, dildos, girls-with-dicks, sex with sheep, female orgasm and more. Not to mention the fact that not even a minute passes without breasts or a sex scene. Returning from "The Naked Mile" are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role as the later films). The whole cast does a good job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great presence of energy and screen. I predict good things for him. The film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh in the movie for me was the spoof "The Deerhunter." Classic. <br /> <br /> The point is: if you are a fan of the series, you will feel at home with the "Beta House". This really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's very funny.
