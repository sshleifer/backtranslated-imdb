I used to watch this show when I was little. Although I do not remember much about it, I must say it was a good show. Besides, I do not think I've seen all the episodes. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the theme song. Everyone was ideally chosen, the costumes were great. The performances were also top notch. I just hope some network brings this series back someday so I can watch every episode. Before ending, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even if I do not think I have seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is brought back to the air, I hope you take it a day before it blows out of the air forever.
