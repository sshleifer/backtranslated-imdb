I was about 12 when I saw this classic cartoon "Casper the Friendly Ghost". I figured it was one of the first ones since Casper did not look * right *, just as Porky Pig does not look * right * in the old 1930s cartoons. But I digress ... Anyway , this episode of the friendly ghost's afterlife concerns him making friends with a young fox he calls Ferdie. I remember being happy to see Casper having a friend, since those who watched the cartoons often know that most people run away from him shouting "A ghost!" Casper and Ferdie have a little fun. together until someone shows up ... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the drawing has only seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. Also, anyone who reads the synopsis of cartoon history can deduce what happens next ... <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit painful. In fact, it's probably the saddest I've ever seen watching a cartoon. But that just means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on that particular drawing and not many others. Or heck, the fact that I really remember this cartoon is due to its emotional effect on me - I have not seen it ever since. But the caricature ends on an optimistic note, and I was glad to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give to that cartwheat 8 out of 10 stars. Losing only for the Warner Bros. cartoon, "Peace on Earth," that's the most I've ever been moved by a short animated film.
