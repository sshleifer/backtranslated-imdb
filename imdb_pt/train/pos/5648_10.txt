I recently bought the complete American Gothic series on DVD and she lived up to my memories of it. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that were never televised. I loved "Ring of Fire," in particular from the stories I had not seen the first time. <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as "evil and sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an excellent player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also excellent in her acting. In fact, the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the series has been screwed up by the network (in collusion with a growing group of censors) because it was really designed. for adult viewing. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genres, he offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level. <br /> <br /> I had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life. life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most delightful "fallen angel" of all time.
