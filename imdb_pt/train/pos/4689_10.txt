I totally agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as being one of the most surprising and informative I have ever seen. As I said earlier, I remember that I began to watch, thinking it was just another study on nature - interesting, not necessarily special, but it was so wrong. Not only the history of the colony was incredible, but I remember the song as being a part of the appeal. As I recall, it was Native Americn Pipes (similar to the song at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I've also been looking for a copy. This should be required for anyone, but especially for schools. It should be re-released.
