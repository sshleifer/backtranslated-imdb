Hey guys, I'm really into this movie! I did not even know I was on this site until I looked at it a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the son of the main characters. It was a great experience and I loved every minute of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at the same time, so they used my twin sister as a double body! The finger that presses the radio button on the car is hers and not mine. I still act and do some TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is the first at the top of the parchment. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was fine, but if I was not in it, it would not be one of my favorites. I thought the performance was very good, but the plot was just more or less.
