Here's a real weirdo for you. It starts with another takeoff in the PSYCHO shower scene on campus, and then gets crazier when several coeds and their crazy boyfriends head south for Spring Break. The problem begins when they head to the redneck county ruled by homicidal Sheriff Dean. One of the college cuties walks into the woods, witnesses a sheriff's murder, and his head is opened. Then it's time to peel MACON COUNTY LINE's time as Dean chases, imprisons and massacles unscrupulous witnesses one by one. Tony March is on target as the evil and happy Dean. The overall tone of the film is truly disturbing. The ending is so abrupt that you almost think the director has run out of film; it is also a study in despair. SHELOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists all over the world.
