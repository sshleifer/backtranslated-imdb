I stumbled upon reissue syndication of this show several years ago and fell in love with it. Has TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and kept me laughing, one episode after the next. I think it did not make it so great, and it was canceled after a few seasons, but I believe it was a good race, and I suggest watching it ... if the opportunity arises.
