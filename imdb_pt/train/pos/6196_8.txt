Fay, the sister of notorious smut poet Simon Grim, a Nobel laureate, still loves Henry Fool. His son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents follows, involving an extremely sad collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and messengers. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey delivers a perfectly timed comedy performance, including brilliant physical work. With strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves in Billy Wilder's best tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble. Another good Hartley score (and thank you for the credits to the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley worked as a partner in the fall of 2004).
