This movie was an interesting Hollywood movie about the novel by the same name of Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think it is full of racial stereotypes, for the time being the very idea of ​​Chinese protagonists was progressive in itself. I found that white actors playing Chinese were not as bad as I expected, which was not the Asian equivalent of blackface. At that time, there were no Asian actors in America (nor George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with it. It was not the best performance I've ever seen, but for the old-school pre-method, it was cool. The locust scene was beautifully filmed and contained compelling special effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the time of liberation during the Great Depression turns this movie into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval that confuses the peasants and how they seem to be left behind by all this. <br /> <br /> The film had some parallels with John Ford's style, but I think the Eastern influence also affected him. . If this were a Western family, the locusts would have won in the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However, here he learns the lesson and wins.
