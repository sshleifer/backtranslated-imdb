When I found the film in the Christmas program, the title did not seem familiar, because I did not read the novel and did not hear anything about the film. However, after reading the content, I decided to spend my Christmas night watching the movie. The effect totally surprised me: I do not remember when I last saw a movie where all the moments involved me. A VOTE FOR CULTURE is undoubtedly one of the films that today constitute a true surprise that I received from the cinema. Here are some of my arguments because I consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema. <br /> <br /> First, all content is particularly educational. It has something to offer the modern public - pure correct faith and some answers to the universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our times? Does love still matter? Why is there faith? What are the logics of overload and suffering in life? Is there really someone next to me I can always trust? The film provides the answers through the content, since everything that happens with the characters can happen with any of us. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is exceptionally human. The main characters experience internal struggles and deal with extremely difficult decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) start their own lives and forget the family or keep the values ​​they have learned at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave his sick wife, Ellen (Barbara Babcock), and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman he falls for? In fact, Ellen does not recognize him anymore ... However, he decides to promise his wife eternal fidelity. If John's rebellious brother Phil (D. David Morin) pursued his easy life, though that did not bring him satisfaction or once he began to think seriously about his life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterpiece of universal aspect of humanity. These words can be said by everyone, no matter where, when or how they live. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is a great portrait of the family, not very popular these days: there are problems, yet there is always something more powerful that unites these people. This "something" is love and trust. I know this may sound a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on fidelity and this may not be as simple as that. However, it is a very educational and realistic aspect. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the whole film focuses on the mutual help of people. If we want to live happy lives in our society, we must understand one thing: we have to help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the film, we see him talking to John about praying. He later helps his brother. Alexander is a type of "angel" who is sent to John and his family. Is it not possible for us to become angels to one another? <br /> <br /> Fifthly, the artistic features also deserve attention. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock performs an authentic performance as Ellen, and despite having a difficult role, she does a perfect job. Consider, for example, the moment she shows up at school and wants to teach a lot again. Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. PHOTO: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on fallen leaves (fall) while the sun (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted as a kind of symbol: even if there is sadness, it can always be illuminated by light and joy ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A vow for culture is a wonderful film that realistically showed me what it means to love, what faithfulness it is too, once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. In the end I would like to quote from the deep words of the film that I find very moving and I hope you do too <br /> <br /> Kyle to his Uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But no one forces you to do this. Still, according to the rules you live?
