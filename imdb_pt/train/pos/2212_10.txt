AND! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is very funny, in the blink of an eye you can see the change of episodes. We want more funny writings from the best writer of all time, Stan Evans. The patron saint of the mindless masses ... He is a talented writer, actor, comic bookmaker, producer, director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole loved him, but he was not a billionaire, so he left him as a billionaire. Many super stars wanted to make movies with actor Stan Evans, who has a performance style "Clark Gable" by "Humphrey Bogart." He should do a lot more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe many other talented producers. We wish you a moment of fame with a great fortune to win. Did you produce any kind of U dramas? or maybe some docudrama ??? A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scripts did he write? Is he under the $$$$$$$$$$$$ billions with Disney? He should earn over $ 50 million ... He could also write a TV movie about the late KING OF POP ... Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more and by Stan Evans in movies and on TV. Thank you. Elvis left the building !!!!!
