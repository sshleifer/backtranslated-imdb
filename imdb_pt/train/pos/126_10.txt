Zentropa is the most original film I've seen in years. If you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir, then this is the right cure for all the Hollywood blockbusters that clog the theaters these days. Von Trier's successes, such as Breaking the Waves, were most acclaimed, but this is really his best work. It is flashy without distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and black humor. It's a shame that he decided that portable cameras were the wave of the future. It is hard to say who has alienated him from the style he exhibits here, but it is the loss of all that he has entered his highly theoretical dogmatic direction.
