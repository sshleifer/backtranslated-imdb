I know there are some purists out there that poo poo all that is not exactly like the original, however, sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it's similar enough to the Japanese version, but at the same time meets the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things with a twist. Iron Chefs are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when cooking, making comments and being flashy during creation. I watched the series and found all the players working well together. Judges are not always the best choices, though. There are some exceptions like the lawyer who has turned into foodie, but most judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served. I like watching the chefs rush and the opponents are amazing. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe it's all anyone can ask for, really want to eat what's served. The only thing I would really change in the series is to ask people on the show to brighten up a bit. Sometimes the weather gets a bit tense, and that's not always fun to watch when you're expecting more fun. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was as exaggerated as the original, but I can say it was a very expensive proposition. I wish he had stayed with this version and was the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, that would make me smile for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits, you may find it a pleasant time.
