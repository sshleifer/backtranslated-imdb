I love this movie. the songs and stories are a lot of fun. and the song "say goodbye" always excites me. What a brilliant thing to do to bring the puppets to life, in a way that you really care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever. great voices and great talent. why all the other muppet movies that came after that movie were far less interesting, moving and funny? that's what mr. henson is so lost?
