I saw it in theaters and absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I've seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a maid in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as the Blue Raja, and I particularly loved that the character was not really British. The scene with him and telling his mother that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved The Bowler talking to the ball. Some of the funniest things involved Stiller's false anger and personality, Mr. Furious, and the fact that his threats and speeches were all unintelligible, and that they never made any sense. I could barely stop applauding when he said "fragarater, Freinken-puss," it was said. But one of the things I liked the most was that Captain Awesome actually dies in the movie. I highly recommend this movie for any occasion, and give it my own personal thumbs up.
