This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to face the stoic as Jet Li can. Action is fast, and special effects are boosted for intensity purposes. As a result, this may lead Americans somewhat off-guard. A small suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li movie. I feel it is an excellent introduction to Jet's work and I look forward to new masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) making it into the US market. A good mix of shootouts and physical conflicts will satisfy most action-movement enthusiasts.
