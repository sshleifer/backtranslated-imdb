Imagine I was about to miss this big cultural event on Swedish TV last night, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the TV on (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!) That I found (yes, I had seen one announcement for him previously but of course forgotten about it and was looking forward to an "early night" ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - this must certainly be a rather unusual idea - basing a documentary film on an interview made with sound only over 30 years ago. But with animations and other documentary materials, it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the most appreciated literary artists of the twentieth century - Georges Remy, also known as Hergé. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely read my Tintin. albums with a different eye after having seen this movie, which makes it easier to connect the variations of style as well as content with the different periods of Hergé's life (and I can say that I will take away the few that I do not Tue). Of course, my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years I've read them, as well as my view on which albums are my favorites, but that adds (at least) one more dimension to them.
