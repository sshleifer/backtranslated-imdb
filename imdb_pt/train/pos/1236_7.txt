Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil himself. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit silly, it never seems sentimental, despite the hilarity of comedy throughout the film; Charles Dance compensates the comedy with its very serious and somber characterization of the evil that keeps the child like hostage. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is very funny, action packed and very attractive in an almost magical charm. way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
