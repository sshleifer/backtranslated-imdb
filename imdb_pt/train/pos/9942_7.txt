A good Korean movie about not just Taekwondo, but what it takes to be good, as a kind of fight for bad guys can not beat a taekwondo in their sport because there are rules as well as there are for life and school and this movie has tones of this notion. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie are not so good, but they are nice and enjoyable. Friends who achieve something they would once mock become stronger through the mind and heart. This film is not to be taken too seriously, as it has a slapstick, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea.
