There are people who claim that this is another "bad language" film ultra violence Mexican. They're right, but more than that, this movie is a call to create awareness of what we've become. The terrible truth hurts or annoys you when you have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things about "Cero y van cuatro" is the open invitation to a deep reflection on our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how Mexican society is spoiled when the Tlahuac incident came to light. I still can not understand the spectators witnessing a mass-transmitted murder. I nearly threw up when I saw some of the pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a small village near Mexico City, when violence was carried out with the indulgence of the media and the government. The re-creation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider "Tamales de Chivo" the best. <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some "bastard" and "asshole". screams. Those are meaningless compared to people's actions. With few exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human waste. Just like in real life, honesty is becoming more of an exception than the rule in our country. Moreover, honesty is rewarded only miraculously.
