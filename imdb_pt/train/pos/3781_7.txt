I would not dare say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good by itself. The comedy in this movie is as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that make me laugh just thinking about them. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it great. Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this movie with a great cast. The main cast of the original movie returns to its characters in this film and everyone does a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his interpretation of Ted in both films, just as I did the Alex Winter Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays the role of Ted Logan's father, does a great job. The scene in which Ted owns the body of his father and Hal London Jr begins to act as Ted is a great scene, and he takes it impressively well. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he made the film completely for me. The rest of the cast is also very good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first part of the Bill and Ted series, then I hope you enjoy this movie too. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you like the movie, thanks for reading, <br/> <br/> -Chris
