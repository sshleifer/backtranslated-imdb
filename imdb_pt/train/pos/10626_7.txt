This is a decent little movie made in Michigan about a guy who is haunted by his past with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and grew up not so well adjusted. In fact, he's absolutely crazy, but he tries not to be so obvious. He also has an entourage, his own demon and angel who follow him around. The devil never says a word, but he does not really need it, and it's Max Schreck - scary. Let's just say that the angel practically turns his wheels on this, since Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" people he chooses to need, especially beautiful women. This is a decent portrait of madness, and you're kind of alone at some point to find out what's going on, but overall, I watched it from start to finish, very focused on the movie because it definitely held my interest. It's a little lacking in some areas, but nothing I can really put my finger on. A decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer movies.
