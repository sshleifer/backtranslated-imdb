A very strange and compelling film. He is a very clumsy and wounded man who tries to navigate his life as a door-to-door fund raiser. The director managed to capture a very disturbing tone that really served the story well. Original and disturbing at the same time, find a great mood in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud, which is not something I do as often as I should. One of the most memorable movies I've seen in a long time. It has not left my mind and I look forward to further efforts by Bronstein. Fantastic performances around. The simple line "I really appreciate it". now it's iconic to me.
