Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising and accurate descriptions of the war that would follow a few years later, but it is woefully naive in its utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson make an excellent cast, although the drama is touched more as a play than as a movie. There are grandiose speeches, though a bit flamboyant, often presented as if the actor was trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words there. Is technology the savior of humanity or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast if one can detach himself from the age of effects. Of course, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but it's rarely so inventive. For the imaginative, the third act is a delight: a world with underground cities, huge deco bombers, space cannons, gyroscopes, and secret science-savvy organizations. It has all the ingredients of a science fiction pulp adventure, but instead uses the pitfalls for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> Things to come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of Hollywood's neolithic science fiction cinema. They are operationally scoped and visually inspiring. Technology has long since left them behind, but their ideas still explode. There is an artistic talent, one with more heart and emotion than the computer-generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are products of craftsmen, not industrialists.
