A very original Sci-Fi animation film, and frankly I love the uniqueness, no matter the path that tends to be, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technical part is innovative, like "Waking Life" that I watched recently. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to get accustomed to the Black-White style, but eventually I love it, the sketch images are really extravagant! The future contracted world is a symbol of the ultimate fate of the human race that I love so much. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is good for a Sci-Fi, not so intriguing, but it's OK, like some Hollywood products, a giant conspiracy about human eternity, a little clich√© and the distorted end does not is so compelling, some development is simply clear and insipid, and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So, I think I'm just in love with the style this movie shows, others are not so good. Over the eternity of life, I think that most people have come to a unanimity that we do not want to eternity because it destroys the meaning of life, we value our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, the world will become a disaster and a chaos. Leaving someone you love is difficult and moving, but it is also a way of showing that our lives are genuine and all emotion fills a person's life and makes the world colorful and lively.
