It was a great pleasure when the show was released because it was such a new show, innovative and original. That makes all the shows I've ever seen look boring. By the time the first episode aired I was in a trance and I clung to all the characters so easily (which usually never happens because I always hate some characters). It's a shame that this show does not have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen and that's not exaggerating my feelings for the show. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC find to replace this show? This is easily the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
