The film has a dirty, somber feel, influenced by HP's work. Lovecraft, which contributes to a very frightening and disturbing atmosphere. There is a considerable amount of gore involved in imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette did a horrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his stunning debut.9 of 10.
