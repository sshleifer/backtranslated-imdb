Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly? With drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared Elvis's agent to separate from the film, it was a mistake. This would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Even though the soundtrack is far from great, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job of creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. A bit of a love story, this is yet another drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story was dying. In addition, Gary Busey is once again perfect in a not-so-perfect role.
