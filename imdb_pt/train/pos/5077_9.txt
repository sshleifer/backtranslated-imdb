Indian cinema typifies police officers of two broad categories: they are the honest type or the bad guys. The honest guys always yell loudly and fight the system, while the bad cops take advantage of most of the time, but suffer in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie breaks at least this usual formula and gives a refreshing sight. of police officers and their lives. The direction takes a look into the life of an ambitious young police officer who. The music is interesting and the editing is a trendsetter with regard to Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is slow at times and the dilemma that Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is overdone at times. But I would still give this 9/10 simply because it has many first to its credit.
