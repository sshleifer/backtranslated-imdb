I, like many horror fans, have been force-fed with the same banal remakes of big budget Hollywood and with the guts of MTV slasher over the last 20 years. Here, finally, is an original horror genre film that marks all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot actress, you want vampires, you want cool guns, you want cool vehicles and you want to bloody a lot, with the bucket load - you got it. <br /> <br /> With excellent fighting choreography and a supporting role from the Hammer Horror itself, Queen Stephanie Beacham herself, this is truly fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget, opting to use the 35mm stock and add quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves has created something that looks much bigger. <br /> <br /> A must for the terror of old school fans.
