I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but in addition to his, I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class, love, and sacrifice divisions (three themes that most great stories or romantic movies have in common). <br /> <br /> Here the main theme is the division of classes. Stella is a story from the time of the Depression in America. Having said that, it was translated to the screen then in a way so memorable that this remake (if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two) was not exactly appreciated. Fans of the original never gave it a chance. Also, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, not exactly a time of major financial problems in America (as Depression was). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove the pink glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see that this powerful story is still true, is as timely and relevant as always in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, class division is the main theme here. Stella is among the working poor, single, with big dreams, but little hope of realizing those dreams. She works in a bar, does not have much money, lives in a miserable apartment. You start drifting. In the morning, she does not want to get out of bed. On her wall, photos of movie stars she idolizes. <br /> <br /> A man watches her dance in the bar. He is rich, educated, one of those upper-class families who has nothing in common with Stella. His main concern is that the university of the ivy league participates in it, it is like paying the rent, like being "happy". They have a case. They like each other. Stella ends up pregnant. Stella tells the guy the news. Your answer? "How about an abortion?" She replies, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He provides the balloons and the proposal, but she sees that her heart is not in him and is too proud to accept. She sends him packing. <br /> <br /> Your daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles - the love she has for her mother and the advantages, happiness, and love offered her by her rich dad. Stella, alone and unloved, and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as she someday makes the last sacrifice. She gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter, and perhaps live indirectly, and hopefully, knowing that at least her daughter has found something to live. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. Everything is right about that. Wonderful trail, artistic cinematography, excellent set design (contrast between the two lifestyles, the messy apartment and the mansions decorated), wonderful and sincere performances of the whole cast, with Oscar in particular, Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is much more meaningful and well done than you were led to believe.
