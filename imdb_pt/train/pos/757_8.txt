I need to be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was rude, offensive, hilarious and cheeky. Yes, there is a lot of humor to suit all tastes. If you enjoy the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards, for example, you have a great time for that. <br /> <br /> Or, if you like people in extreme bad actions, you will also have a great time. And if you like eschatological humor and extreme situations, oh, you'll enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I like all three types of humor that "Dirty Sanchez" offers. I like to laugh at show situations. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this. So, if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, try the extreme stupidity of English in this program. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. Not recommended for those who are easily offended or extrapolated. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Especially the character Paco.
