Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic casting this movie in a 10:00 news review, I wanted to see him. I do not remember who it was, or what local Omaha newscast it conveyed, but the critic insisted very much that this film was very contemptible to the Iranian midfielder Nebraskan. They showed an excerpt from the scene in which John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she is swimming in the pool. The character of Glover is praising how cool his body is and so on, using many words that the local station found necessary to edit. He was in prison. There was a problem, though. I was only 13 at the time and had to wait a year until he was released on cable. Let's just say, it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If there was ever a guilty pleasure of mine, this movie is it. Calling this despicable movie would be a huge euphemism. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small scumbags after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor boy who just wanted an adventure and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrible villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable rags of all time. He's sloppy, funny at times, and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there's the character of Robert Trebor (good name, by the way!), Leo, who is clearly overcome with this blackmail scheme. He is a sweaty, weeping coward who runs a peeps show with nude live models. So you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a thoughtful sociopath that everyone fears for good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he is facing, Scheider turns the table in those shivers and takes control of the situation until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is played brutally, with virtually the entire cast being shot, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I love this movie so much. It really should scare me, but that does not happen. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting, and the story has a lot of chances that most of today's movies will never try. It's scary to think that the adult movie industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover in Los Angeles looking for trouble. Just thinking of your voice is enough to make me laugh. "Hey sport, have a good day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of shootings, cool cars, great dialogues (like the line in my opening speech) and decent acting. Many appearances of real-life porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy playing in a hot tub with two cubs in a party scene in place of Glover. <br /> <br /> Another thing I should add: how hot are the women in this movie ??? Wow!! Travolta did the right thing by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see Vanity get naked in a time before she becomes a born-again Christian. And Ann Margret. What more could you say about her, except that she is the American Beauty par excellence. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> So says the Hound. <br /> <br /> Added February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
