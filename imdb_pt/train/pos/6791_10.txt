I second the motion to do this in a movie, it would be great !! I was also impressed with the storyline and character built in this game. I've played it over and over (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eats your heart !! THIS MUST BE DONE ON A MOVIE !!!!! If someone out there wants some help to start a petition for this to be turned into a film, contact me. I would love to help with this project at any time. The graphics are great for PS1 and even make you forget it's PS1 most of the time. The multiplicity of side quests makes it different each time you play.
