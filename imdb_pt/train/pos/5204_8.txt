I do not watch much porn, but I love porn stars. And I love bloody movies. So when I heard about a pornographic movie, I was very excited. Of course, this was years ago and when I heard about all the problems in making and ending the movie, I never thought I'd really get to see it. But I did and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all its faults. <br /> <br /> First, the flaws. The story takes place in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story he seems to want to tell is about the Sawney Beane clan of Scotland. So why not just put it there and skip the third grade report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? In addition, it breaks its own rules, stating that you are safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants just start running wildly everywhere. It's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with. There is a large stone castle that is obviously old, but no one has noticed this before. The references to horror movies are annoying and the characters too. The heroine has a flashback mount of all her dead friends that include a character she has never met. The ending does not make sense. <br /> <br /> So, what works? The blood! Of course I would have liked it more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that I was not afraid to be anything more than a gore movie. Two murders are done over and Taylor Hayes has a really disgusting good scene. The two wild murders receive even shots on the DVD. I've always been of the mind that Gore can overcome a stupid story and Evil Breed reinforced that.
