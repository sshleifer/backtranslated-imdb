WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claimed that it is one of the cheapest and coolest low budget stocks ever made. I usually do not watch movies knowing they are going to be bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was really glad I did it. <br /> <br /> It's packed to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically bloody), sleaze (isolated for nudity with a female key character but there's a lot of that in a scene that becomes hilarious) dialogue outrageously strange, all this contributes to laughter. Inducing the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Ginty, the unusual star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget critters) is enjoying the lead, giving the best performance he has achieved. Williamson is better than usual, clearly getting carried away with an incomparable joy (and he does not go in the middle). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexstick who speaks with an accent that seems to be a miscellany of Spanish and Italian. She is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Once again, I can not emphasize how bloody it was. It's not so bloody it's nauseating, but it's unusually violent in some parts with some squibs of flesh coming out in the shootings and it has a tiring torture sequence that no one will forget so soon. Also, when Ginty is being invaded by a bunch of thugs, he conveniently picks up a chainsaw and the moments that follow will have every fan of action cheering and pouring his beers. <br /> <br /> Do not lose WHITE FIRE. It's a classic action fun - if stupidly stupid mind.
