My 2 year old son likes the Doodlebops show, seems to keep his attention for some time. The characters are interesting, vibrant with primary colors and all. There is not much educational content that the intended audience can benefit from, but they seem to have a theme in each program and try to teach kids about sharing, respect, and other basics, so I like that for that. It is well produced with high production values. But it's really just a medium show like most TV shows these days. We do not buy the angle of the merchandise and we have our son wearing everything Dooblebop. I do not think we would spend money to go to a live show if they came to town. Going to the Zoo or Science Center is a much better experience for everyone involved and, in my opinion, it is better to spend money.
