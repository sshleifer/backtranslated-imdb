A common plot in films consists of the main characters, leaving the bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature. In the Power of Kangwon Province, two stories of individuals are shown doing just that, trying to find themselves by traveling to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon province. However, instead of epiphany moments, we have two characters whose trip to nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie is slow, contemplative. In the end, we learned what really brought each one to Kangwon Province and learned how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood glamor and for a movie to give them a definite answer, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves them wondering, imagining, affecting them years later, this movie is more than satisfying that desire.
