Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever done. To earn money you have to be INTELLIGENT. Not only that, you have to be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. In fact, it requires skill. Not like some dumb shows that are in those days. And yet, they only have two seasons of it! Bull .. they need to bring this show back !! <br /> <br /> Although, they will find it difficult to pull Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But, seriously, it was an incredible show. You never knew who would be going when. And it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you could really play alone if you wanted to! <br /> <br /> BRING BACK TO THE MOLE !!!! BRING BACK TO MOLE !!!!
