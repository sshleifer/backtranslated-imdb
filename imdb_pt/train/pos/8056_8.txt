This image in 1935 went away with all sorts of Ocars for Best Director, John Ford, Actor Victor McLaglen and Music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), "Call the Marines", 42, did an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rude and hard crowd who were fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer. with lots of drink. Gypo Nolan made a mistake when he decided to become an informant to his best friend in order to take a trip with his girl to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), "Diary of Guadalcanal," 43, gave a large supporting role as leader of the Irish rebellion and was eager to capture the informant from his group. Gypo Nolan is haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel like a Judas. Great movie for 1935 and wonderful acting for McLaglen, but depressing in every aspect of the film.
