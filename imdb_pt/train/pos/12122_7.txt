The movie can be great. I only watched last night, but I feel unable to give an honest opinion about it because I read the book first. The book is so much better than the movie that disappointed me with the movie. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book beforehand. On the other hand, the book is so good, and contains much more than the love affair Phillip has with Mildred, you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not make that claim lightly. On average, I read a book every four days and read authors as disparate as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
