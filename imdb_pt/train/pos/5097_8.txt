This is a very rare and probably the least known film of Shirley Temple, as it is not in any of its collections. The reason why is probably because it does not have a happy ending, unlike all of your other movies. musical, although she sings a song called "The world owes me life". The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and in VHS, I would say they did a good job as the color looks realistic, on the contrary I would say that the colorful films of Laurel and Hardy who are terrible. The movie is good for its age and the story has not dated at all, I'm surprised no one tried to make a remake. Sometimes the movie is a bit to talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard they seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five. do not get discouraged, because this movie has some genuinely good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Ga Ry Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and sluggishness accumulate in their actions, {while at the same time their daughter sings to an audience in another room} is very well directed. Gary and Caroles nervous facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good. this is a good movie from the early 30's, accept it for your age.
