Skippy, from Family Ties, goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this very extravagant movie. The film looks like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed that the metal music was leaving their kids ill or causing them to kill themselves - except in this one, a satanic metal star is trying to get back from the grave (using Skippy to help ). And while the plot is tacky and clich√©d, rudeness (for example, an evil green mist stripping a girl's clothes) and soundtrack are what makes the movie so hilarious (and great). And of course there is nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who is asking what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to have some friends for a good laugh. And while you're at it, make it a double feature with the Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's a "bad rocker" punch killer (as indicated on the video box) in black fringed leather. A must see for cheese movie fans.
