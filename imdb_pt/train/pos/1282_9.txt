I've seen this a few times on the Sundance Channel for several years, and I got a good film shake on the system. A semi-surrealist but hard-edged approach to modern media culture (or lack thereof), focusing on some seriously misplaced, outdated Hollywood dwellers. He had an entertaining initial performance of Mark Ruffalo and a memorable DP filmmaking that made the films of the Polish Brothers. There was a wild, intriguing humor and an oddly original feeling that definitely set him apart. This movie had a cult classic written entirely, and I'm surprised it has not yet come out on DVD. <br /> <br /> I hope soon.
