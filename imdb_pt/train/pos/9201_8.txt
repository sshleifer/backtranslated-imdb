Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (the sister) grows up in a rich environment but this is not enough to get her to reject her life and finally join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs. Prashant (the brother), on the other hand, grows in a less affluent environment, but grows up to be a matured gentleman. The story marks Prashant making efforts to save his little sister (who is perpetually in trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This film passes the test of time, commenting that worship and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they should stand up and be counted in the face of adversity. Great musical compositions in this movie mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director brings a strange feeling to it.
