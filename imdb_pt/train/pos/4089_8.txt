Strangely erotic gothic horror schlock that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans all over the world. It seems to be an interesting one about "Beauty and the Beast". Definitely worth a look and surprisingly well interpreted when one takes into consideration the genre and the season. <br /> Corsets, castles, horses in heat, furious monsters in the forest, proof that no one had a Brazilian race. in the 70's, and more body fluids than you can shake a stick, what more could you want? <br /> <br /> It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon!
