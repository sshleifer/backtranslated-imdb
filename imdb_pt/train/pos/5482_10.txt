This is an amazing movie. In addition to showing real images of important events in the failed coup to overthrow Ch√°vez, we received the background image that describes a society divided into classes. Many of the rich, it seems, have a choice with the democratic choice of the people, and are willing to use the military for regime change. "Beware of what you say in front of your servants" is a telling commentary. The head of the country's biggest oil company sees himself as the new president, with US backing, and these young Irish filmmakers have it all in front of the cameras. A great film to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation of how the media can be manipulated and the force used, in the interests of large corporations, against the interests of the people's democratic desires. Riveting things.
