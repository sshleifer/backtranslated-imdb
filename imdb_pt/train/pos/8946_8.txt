This impossible tale is of a female witch chasing a mortal man, in a mortal world. Her "community" is open among her members, but she hides her witchcraft from mortals. Hmmmm ... this is starting to sound familiar. I LAUGHED A LOT. It's not your typical movie. Very "campy" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found his partnership with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story). With a new interest in all things, witch and darkness, this movie deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences ...... It's still a ride!
