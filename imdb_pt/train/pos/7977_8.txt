Basically, the film may be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's get right to the point, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioners / thriller of all time. <br /> <br /> When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really do a perfect duet. Both this film and Deja Vu are the best thrillers you can expect. Washington really got very comfortable on the unstable cameras and all the scenes running in the movie. One would be easily related to the emotions of his character, so he enjoyed all the murders on the road. It is a success that they have created a super-dark city of Mexico with a lot of shit going on. One would easily be convinced by the extent of the corruption described in Man On Fire. I do not know what Mexicans think when they watch this ... Well, let's face it again. It is among the best of the genre Death Wish, but also suffered with great amount of violence. It's a little annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the film very realistic and let Denzel Washington interpret the kind of tragic hero "missing sheep." In the end, they even had the kidnapper shoot his own pool like a documentary. I was checking in IMDb if the movie was based on actual events for this ...... So this is for your consideration if you also think the theme of the movie is a little fake. <br /> <br /> In the end I hope one does not take this movie for real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for art direction / editing / motion picture / Denzel Washington.
