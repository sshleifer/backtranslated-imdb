I thought for a first episode of a first series went very well. It was a lot of fun and I found the actors brilliant. I think it's a crime to say it was bad because it seemed like the right time. I think it's really annoying when people say it was not historically correct because it's supposed to be a Saturday night entertainment show not a boring story documentary so I guess the costumes and settings were just right. A brilliant start and I will love what will come next !! I talked to a lot of people at my school and they love the show! We all think it's a brilliant entertainment and have great stories to keep up with.
