This film is one of the most daring black and white films of the time, in the early 1930s, before the Hoyts Code was applied. It is the story of a young and beautiful woman moving to New York and going to the top of the business using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the beautiful young Lily Powers. which in fact does a good job with its performance. Lily moves to New York and climbs to the place of business sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck does an excellent performance as being a strong woman who uses men as a single time, hardly any emotion towards them as if they were pedestrians. Lily Powers is a woman who has no love in her mind for just power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a bit different than other movies I've seen, because there's virtually no background music. heard. I believe it is only because it is when people were introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film. The few times that music is heard is during the beginning, as we are shown as it makes its way up the jail. The filming and different scenes were something fantastic! The director of this film has made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this movie full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was a whole movie together. The end of this movie was not as good as it should have been, but it did not spoil everything. Baby Face has had her slow scenes throughout the film, and perhaps a few predictable parts, as with who she goes to sleep next. But this is a lovely movie that can be seen more than once and suggested to some people and friends.
