I will not claim to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because I'm not. I only watched 5 of his animated films so far: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can state, is that I found "Fire and Ice" to be the most enjoyable of the lot. It is a simple fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of Conan the barbarian, but the beautiful work of art, realistic animation and lively soundtrack lends a very classic charm to this film. <br /> <br /> Deserving first mention is the animation itself. I do not care what people say about rotoscopy, but in my opinion, Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was amazed at how realistic the character's movements were. The style of driving and the drawings of photo-realistic characters made "Fire and Ice" look more like a big-budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of detail in the art tends to get a bit inconsistent, especially near the end of the film. Some scenes look really flat, with little or no body contour detail or fabric folds and shadows in the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic characters, realistic action follows naturally. Not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. I would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action of living action movies like Zack Snyder's 300. But I noticed that, although there was bloodshed, the bloodstains were kept to a minimum. Again, a great choice by the creative staff that just adds to the viewing experience by not taking things too "over the top". <br /> <br /> Although I recognize no "big name" in the cast, the voice actors can deliver satisfactory performance; keeping the delivery of each line realistically subdued and only decreasing in the case of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I said bandits ?? Yes, I did. Because that's exactly what the story is about, a good tale versus a tale of evil. Nothing really original about the story that seems to be just a mix of pre-existing cliches of fantasy films involving warriors and girls outrageously dressed. Anyone looking for "depth" would be very disappointed. The characters do not have much development and some of them like Nekron and Darkwolf are one-dimensional at best (I've heard rumors of some deleted scenes that explain Darkwolf's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother.) Scenes like this would merit complete restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a depth level to the show). In fact, I would not be surprised to discover that the whole movie was just a "technological demonstration" to showcase the incredible animation and art, with the story pooled and released as a belated reflection, in order to pass it off as a true "film ". <br /> <br /> A true classic from a bygone era, "Fire and Ice" truly captures the ardent spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful depictions of fantastic creatures and enchanting characters. It is a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and the artist Frank Frazetta with a good dose of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Would it hold up to the standards of today's animated films? Definitely not. But I encourage animation fans in general to "get off your horse high" and give this simple but beautiful movie a chance to grow in you. It truly is an 80's gem worth checking out.
