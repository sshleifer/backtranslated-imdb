** Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Suspense Hitchcockian gives Williams an unobtrusive performance. <br /> <br /> What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the almost paranoia that associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the latest fan scenario, based on fact no less, Williams stars as a talkative radio personality called Gabriel Nobody who reads stories he wrote about the radio waves and amassed an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin), who submitted a manuscript on the troubles of his troubled youth to the editor of Noah, Ashe (Morton), who gives no one to read for himself. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally disturbed, but ends up puzzled by the existence of Pete's nightmare being abducted and sexually abused for years, until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette giving an excellent performance) who adopted the boy, but his correspondence with anyone reveals that Pete is dying of AIDS. Naturally no one wants to meet fans, but is suddenly in doubt for their possibly twisted second motives when the seed is planted by his lover Jess (Cannavale), whose sudden departure from his apartment in New York has no one in an emotional fall that has only now grew up in a storm in a cup of tea when he decides to do some investigations into the backgrounds of Donna and Pete discovering some truths he did not anticipate. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay) with his former lover Terry Anderson and the movie's rookie director, Stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's farce, he has some Hitchcockian moments that work like any old-fashioned cauldron. This helps Williams to give a discreet performance as the good-hearted personality in conflict, who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is indeed real and loves him (the only thing that escaped his own reality). and has some terrifying moments unsettling with the chilling Collette, whose only physical feature I will fail to mention, but it underlines the desperation of his character that can take him to the core. <br /> <br /> However, the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable, despite a finely-directed piece of cheat and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to his own inner voice: Be careful what you expect.
