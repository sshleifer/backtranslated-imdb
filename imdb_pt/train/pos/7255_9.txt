This is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most people I know do not. Portraits are the cruelty to body and mind that happen in a war very well, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds," something more found in books and rarely in movies, but done very well in this matter. I would put it next to "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could exhibit it at school, along with the other two films. - however, finding a copy proved to be very difficult - which is a shame.
