Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude toward sexuality. He has no problem coveting naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men it's when he loses it. He believes that when women actually have sex it is when they lose any sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he strolls through the Hollywood hills chasing couples who have sex in the distance, ultimately shooting dead men with a high-powered rifle with a scope. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the existence of this movie is to enter into sexual relations. activity repeatedly. The "story" seems more like a belated reflection. This is bound to leave many happy happy heterosexual men, since we are treated with prolonged scenes of nudity (women here look pretty good without clothes) and sex to serve as a great deal of excitement. Of course, seeing a good deal through a scope raises considerably the creepiness factor and illustrates the compulsion to voyeurism. (On the one hand, Mike watches the couples for a few minutes before finally pulling the trigger.) This is all underlined by terribly intrusive, if somewhat atmospheric, music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those with a disgusting garbage trend are bound to appreciate this in one degree or another. It even includes a lesbian encounter that confuses Mike and leaves him uncertain * how * to react. It unfolds at a very slow pace, but ends with a more fun ironic twist. It's a perverted rarity that, if nothing else, will keep some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
