First I'd like to say how great that is. It's surprising and sometimes shocking. And to say the least I'm 11 and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely endure a boring movie, but that's anything but annoying. It is like a journey for humanity. His glaring realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a painful tale of two and a half (VOIGHT AND HOFFMAN) that builds a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), a naive Texan boy, comes to New York to enrich him entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's "manager", but soon they both can not find a job for Joe that results in stealing food. While trying to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can not have a girl for Joe until they meet a lady at a party. Joe gets some money and soon Joe takes Ratso to a dream spot in Ratso, Florida. The final five minutes are heartbreaking, but they are some of the best moments in the movie. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY, we have a bleak and sometimes disturbing urban view of life.
