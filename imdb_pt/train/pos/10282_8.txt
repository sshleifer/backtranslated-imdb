If your idea of ​​a thriller is car chases, explosions and dozens of people being shot dead, the "Game House" is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and enjoy psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, watch it. "House of Games" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and engages in the dark world of swindlers led by the charismatic Mike Joe Mantegna). To say anything else about the plot would ruin the suspense. Frankly, I find it hard to believe someone who says he saw the twists coming. Just like a smart con man, this movie draws you to your web and soothes your vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story is tense and well crafted, the dialogue clever and laconic, the performance uniformly good (Mantegna is supremely charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very nice character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so unattractive physically. But Dr. Ford must be cool and indifferent; moreover, its simplicity is essential to the plot (at one point, I believe an injury to your sexual self-esteem is a fundamental part of your motivation ... I will not say more). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a bleak look at the bottom of human nature that concludes with a note of uncomfortable ambiguity. It will hold your attention every second while watching, and will stay with you for a long time afterwards.
