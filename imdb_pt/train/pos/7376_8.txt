I really enjoyed that debut by Ring's director, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and the idea of ​​this movie. It has a subtle mystery about it that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most movies of that genre. If you like movies that give you goosebumps, you'll probably like this movie. A good and scary debut by Hideo Nakata. 8/10
