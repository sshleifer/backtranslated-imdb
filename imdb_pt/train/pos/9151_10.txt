The savage savagery of Savage Island will scare you! Trust me. <br /> <br /> When the boy from the distant Savage Family is run over by some tourists in the city, Pa Savage wants revenge, and he will stop at nothing until he can. <br /> <This is a real horror movie with some truly wonderful horror moments. <br /> <br /> In addition, negative criticism comes clearly from someone who does not have adequate knowledge of the film. The filmmakers chose lighting and camera work to reflect the dark, dark and dark climate of history; in other words, to get a certain aesthetic. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film has already won several awards from the horror film festival.
