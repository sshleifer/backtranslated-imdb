Lupine departs for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting gem that an old man gave him. It's a different place for Lupine, with the desert and that exotic, warm feel. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a place other than Lupine. . On the one hand, its classic dynamics is lost, but it is a change of pace. In addition, Lupine can focus on women ... Fujiko rules this. Throughout the feature, she seduces Lupine and us, bystanders. So there's Lara, the maid of this particular tale, and she's very nice. This one has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun distinction to have. <br /> <br /> There's a very funny ninja effeminate guy who is the best villain in this, and of course he has a great fight with Goemon. , as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also at war here in good shape. <br /> <br /> Practically, this is a quiet walk with Lupine. The plot is medium and there are some slow points, but everything in this movie is a real pleasure. Appreciate.
