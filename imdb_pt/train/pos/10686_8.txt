And I'm a Nicole Kidman fan. I would pay to see and hear her read the Moscow phone book, which, from what I know, she may be doing while speaking Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four directors are excellent, but the film itself is a series of good images and better scenes held together for nothing. While someone is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this one asks the viewer too much. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (which is in parts) or rather scary (which is in one scene), but the director did not seem to know the way to go.
