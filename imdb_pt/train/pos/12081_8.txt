Nina Foch delivers surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun and little Gothic nail-biter. She accepts a position as secretary to a widow of London society (played imperiously by Dame May Witty) and her scary son (the impatient and annoying George Macready). Before she realizes it, she wakes up to find herself in a seaside mansion she has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call her Marian and try to convince the servants and neighbors that she is Macready's mad wife. Of course this pair can only be plotting cowardly acts, and even though Julia has to eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis builds a real suspense by answering the question of how she'll manage it. My Name Is Julia Ross "has nothing stylistic to differentiate it from any number of films released over the same period, but I was surprised at how well it held together despite its string budget of shoe and pedigree of film B.

In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have fainted, screamed and hesitated, hoping her hero would come to save her. So I can not tell you how good it was to have the heroine in this movie using your brain and figure out how to save yourself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> B +
