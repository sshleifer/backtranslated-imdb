I teach Japanese to an online high school and include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country and the language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the movie. Stereotypes or not, this helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently from ours. Many of my students have told me that they liked the film so much they will get a copy for them. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I could have a clean TV version. I'm not really in the gross language that auto workers use all the time.
