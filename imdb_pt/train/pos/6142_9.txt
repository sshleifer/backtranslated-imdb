Delicious Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in great shape as a middle-aged spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in World War II in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 at the time of the movie and she is ideal for the part. She is Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it is for the benefit or children and for Mother England during a period of great danger. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as the teacher. of witchcraft in an attempt to obtain certain information about witchcraft. These 3 little darlings sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are simply marvelous in this charming movie for all of us regardless of age. <br /> <br /> Shame on Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe There's so little you can do in this captivating movie. <br /> <br /> I really thought of Ben Stiller's film "Night at the Museum" at the end of the movie, when the relics come alive to fight. with the Nazi invasion in the small British coastal city.
