My God ! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this one is really disturbing, but not horrible like the Nekromantiks. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest and the direction is totally inventive, despite the lack of money (see the sketch of the "bridge"). Highly highly recommended!
