I saw two movies over the weekend, one was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood", but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Hindi comedy films. Your Charecter Casting is perfect. The seemingly drawn story of a Gujerati Play is incredible, the treatment is excellent with a few exceptions. In Bollywood, when a movie is set up, the first thing a Bollywood director is likely to do is sign up for a musical director and this guy (Malik mediocre in this case) is required to sing six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease Fincher and those of Grandma who just can not get enough of those numbers. No musical director can produce good music relentlessly, as is clearly evident in this film. None of the songs have any melody and are clearly intrusive to the storytelling, except the background music and the westernized version of the Bharat-Natyam. The duel and the role of father and son are good for Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly remarkable. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and is willing to wait until a good story appears as in this super film. So we have a cheap, classless, insipid Producer like Sharukh Khan who will lower himself to the point of capturing and blatantly promoting junk like "Kaal" to enrich himself at the expense of the enhancement of Art, and they surround themselves with bordering talent, and they recover the investment before the word spreads. These are the Bollywood locusts who take advantage of the unsuspecting audience to win Bollywood Chamcha awards "Film Farce" and most of them are in the media.
