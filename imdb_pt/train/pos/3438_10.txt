The film was very remarkable despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In fact, things like that happen and that's why this movie shows a lot of that. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in excellent performance), whose college has recently started having everything going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a fantastic performance) at a frat party that turns out to be a true gentleman and sweet. He invites her to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and end up going to your apartment. They talk and take her to the basement, where they keep flirting with each other. She tries to stop it, but he rapes her. This incident scares her. She goes to a club and meets a bartender / DJ Adrian (much played by Marcus Patrick), who sees that she is getting drunk and helps before going too far. They attack a friendship. He also uses drugs and Maya gets to use it too. In other words, it introduces you to a different world. She starts going back to school and works as TA (Teaching Assistant) and sees Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to soften Maya's voice, but she still has the advantage decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and perseverance. Chad Faust does not like that he can be a rapist, but he does an excellent job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very bright the man who saves Maya and trains her to a new world. This movie deserves a prize.
