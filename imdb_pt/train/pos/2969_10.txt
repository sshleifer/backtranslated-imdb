This movie is about two guys who created a sport on the spot trying to get 2 to get the hot one. BASEketball becomes a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. The first time I saw this movie I wet my pants was so funny. a definite must see for all comedy fans. If you love south park you will love it! Maybe not watching with kids is a little inappropriate for the little guys. some failures give 6 1/2 out of ten, I give out 11 out of ten. I like to coop it rocks I have to go bye bye thanks for reading this
