I watched this movie by mistake. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks and looks like a 1970s movie. And it's actually better, more restrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. Environmental and anthropological tones are far ahead of their time. Discrete cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. Far more than dances with wolves, The Last Hunt can convey the appearance of the buffalo "deadly fields" of the late nineteenth century. Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields. The film was filmed during the slaughter of forest-driven buffaloes, so the animals you see are actually being shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, a much-underestimated Western masterpiece, superbly represented, directed and filmed.
