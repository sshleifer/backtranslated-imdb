Some Spoilers If you are a big fan of horror movies then you will know that Halloween has paved the way for many horror movies. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies of all time, if not the scariest. <br /> <br /> I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this, that's how it worked. But I would have to say that it strikes everyone else. It's really scary, and watching Michael come out from behind a bush or walk in the dark sends a shiver down his spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy and tilts his head to the side. It's one of the strangest images in movie history. <br /> <br /> The last slashers, like the movies on Friday the 13th, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie is better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he's realistic, you could imagine a crazy guy like him out there killing people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> What's great about this movie is that it does not rely on blood or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It's very bad that the later films in the series have been influenced by this, because that's as good an example of a spectacular horror film as they come.
