/ The first episode I saw of Lost made me think, I thought whats this some people who fell and were chased by a giant monster. But it's not like that, it's much more than that, because yours is no monster and every episode you see of Lost, well, it's getting better every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between people who crossed each other before they fell. This is the real secret. <br /> <br /> This series rules and I can not wait to know what's really going on there. I hope they do not show the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
