This is a meeting, a team and a great episode of Justice. From hesitancy to resolution, Clark took an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny, to a superman who, like the Green Arrow, set aside his emotions for his few loved ones, ready to save the planet all. This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; this is also about deciding what is most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope the subsequent episodes follow strictly what Justice shows without a push to "rewind" and put a good ending here in Smallville - and a wonderful start to Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and the team. Nine stars must give enough credit.
