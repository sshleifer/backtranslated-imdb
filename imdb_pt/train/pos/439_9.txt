The true measure of any work of fiction is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the altered experience in some meaningful way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) in the end. <br /> <By this measure, April Enchanted is a resounding success. Like a movie in general, he gets a great cast, well-built characters that you care about, wonderful script and beautiful scenery and locations. In short, the film is, well, charming. While all performances are top notch, three must be mentioned - Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual good job and is still overshadowed by so many others in the cast. Highly recommended, especially if you are a romantic at heart. More Deponent Saith Not.
