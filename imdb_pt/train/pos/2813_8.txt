This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. To put this in perspective, it was when Gay was the word used for the homosexual revolution, and not just for Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used that way today? I believe that most of the film comes from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it's already gone by. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled with the documentaries capturing the love of one man for another. period of one year. A love expressed in ways that only true love can be. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are life scenes as homo-sexual and life as gay. The movie itself was a labor of love, and I believe it to be a diamond. At the very least, we will come out of this film with an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I think of how much earlier this film seems to me to have been defined. The advances in medical, political, and social sciences and culture that have occurred since this film was created (about 15 years ago) are staggering. However, obviously, in the case of the AIDS disease itself, we are not yet finished. I think we do not end on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a very good documentary. I encourage anyone who feels they do not understand gay life, gay issues or the devastation of AIDS to watch this movie.
