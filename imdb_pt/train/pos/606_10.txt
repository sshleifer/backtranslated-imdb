I've seen a lot of Saura movies and I've always found it amazing how he mounts music, dance, drama and movies in his films. Iberia shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that caught my attention is the fact that in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: the camera shows several aspects of musical interpretation, examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is yet another ingredient in making this movie perhaps the most aesthetically exciting among her other works. That's why I strongly recommend to those who love good cinema, good music, good dancing, great art.
