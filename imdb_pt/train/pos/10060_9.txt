Wang Bianlian is an old street artist who is known as a 'King of Masks' for his mastery of Sichuan's changing art. Liang is a famous opera artist of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art should not die with Wang and then he sows the seed of an heir in Wang's mind. The film is about prejudices, male domination, state of the art, values ​​and most importantly heat. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has meaning. It's a long story that was edited so well that the length of the film is only 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes is an artistic film, next five minutes is a sad movie, next five minutes is a thriller. He just keeps changing his mood as his protagonist changes his face. Last scene on the rope is terrific. History and script is flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists you can tell how they behaved. Very impressive. He was not even nominated for an Oscar. In that year 'English patient' got the best Oscar film and in the foreign film category 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK and about 'English patient' the smaller said the better. Watch 9/10.
