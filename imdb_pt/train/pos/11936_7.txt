I really enjoyed this movie as a kid. At that age I thought that silly antics were funny and that the movie was "cool" because of sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what movie was well designed. This film opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles that other children dealt with and real world issues. This type of exposure is largely missing films for kids these days that I do not think is for the benefit of our society. Of course baseball jokes look really dumb now, but they did attract the kids. No seven-year-old boy is going to ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to watch a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and took the opportunity to teach these children an important lesson about the world. As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems much less impressive, however, I will give credit. for the actors who play the two children and Danny Glover, who did a fantastic job.
