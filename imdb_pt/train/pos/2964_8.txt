The BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that features acting that generally makes the movie more fun, comedy material that is more than a funny shit in your pants, and a very good plot despite the fact that it is the classic slackers against the rich and evil face. and the only thing I disliked about BASEketball was that kid was not really needed in the movie, but if the kid was not in the movie, some of the funny scenes would not have existed. If you've read any pro review on this movie, delete them all because basically all reviewers did not like this movie. BASIC is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.
