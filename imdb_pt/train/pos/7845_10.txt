So Fox pulled the plug in the middle of a drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How lame is that? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a real risk of never figuring out what happens? Why were the remaining episodes, already recorded, not aired in the US? They were broadcast somewhere else. <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening? This was a great show, but you got us hanged. If you are to introduce new dramas / mysteries, at least finish a conclusion before ending abruptly in the middle of the subject. Every time something like that happens (and it seems to happen a lot to you - that is, Fox), there are more people who will "wait and see" before investing their time. This means that you will see an artificially low interest share and a higher probability of closing the series. Watch? It's a vicious cycle. Do not disappoint us again ...
