Normally, the best way to annoy me in a movie is to include some reference to Orson Welles. But here's a science fiction comedy that cites the broadcast of the War of the Worlds ... and it's gold! The very concept of a small group of diminutive, aggressive, and stupid aliens being confused as children in a Halloween dress is magnificent. Do not be fooled by the notion that because it looks like a kid's movie, it's not fancy - it is not, there is so much hidden treasure ... A gem!
