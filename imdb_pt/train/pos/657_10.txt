La Maman et la Putain has to be seen as a film that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. It's true that the actors do not "act" ... It's true, they talk a lot ... But what they say is what makes life worthwhile ... or dying. The very long monologue by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most precise and moving text ever written about femininity, masculinity and love. It is not easy to translate accurately, however. This film is a statement about the difficulty of being male and female (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
