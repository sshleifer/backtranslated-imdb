I absolutely loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I watched. It was not strange to me. I totally identified with the characters. I would love to see it again (and hopefully I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really attracted to the fantasy world. And for me the movie was loooong. I wonder if I've seen the series and confused them? The acting that I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreamy to a 10 year old (when I first saw the movie, not in 1970.) I still remember the characters vividly.the flute was totally believable and I can still 'feel' the woods of evil.Witchy poo was scary - I would not want to cross her path.
