Without Kirsten Miller, this project need not be completed. However, with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend. It seemed that the other actors were just toying with their strong performance. Wagner's disheartening attempt to honor this film was a little disappointing, but his few scenes did not diminish the possibility of being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with writing and plot, the assembled group of talents did a heroic job of saving what should have been a disaster. Miller's charismatic delivery and timing was impeccable and believable. She interprets this tenuous line between assertive and bossy, but never offensive, she is indeed the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen it on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky enough to rent it before it got lost.
