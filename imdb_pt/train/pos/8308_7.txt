It's appropriate, on a musical Sunday, to make your heart race and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing women's drawers and set rock and roll. <br /> <br /> See Leon to provide a definitive characterization, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock. 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> This was a fascinating biopic where we saw Little Richard struggling with his father, his church, and him about who he was. He has won the battle and there is no one else who has his voice or his style.
