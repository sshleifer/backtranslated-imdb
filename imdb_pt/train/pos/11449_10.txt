This was by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I have ever seen on screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a type of man who is in extinction. he sees the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good way. Your purity, honesty and gentleness breathe clearly as you watch him working on pieces of art so simplistic but full of life. I was amazed at how patiently he created his pieces and with what patience he accepted his end. sometimes prematurely, but his sense of Scottish humor brilliantly covers his disappointments. the film is filmed elegantly and contains the same flow as the art of Goldsworthy has. combines nature and art in a minimalist way, as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to mix everything without interfering with the naturalistic sound. This is, in general, a great job in every respect. there are no age limits.
