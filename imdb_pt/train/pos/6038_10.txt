But the opposite, sorry, I completely understand how you can be dragged into a movie because you relate to the subject (and you have). This movie is terrible, the main character would give any charlie brown subtitle a run for his money, he just constantly mutters that it is always a laugh, most of the scenes just feel strange with the characters more often than not looking at another with a look .. your line now, so I'll react. Best British comedy? Please mate, have a strong word with your bad bad ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this movie is horrible. I mean, well done to the people involved ... they made a movie ... and maybe motorcycle enthusiasts might be interested in that, but the people who still live here on earth with a true sense of humor will fight it over than smile for the Christmas Present they are bought in them ... was it very hard? I apologize...
