How powerful and captivating quality cinema can be. This film tells its story with everyday scenes that manage to reveal the poignancy hidden within. It's true, as others have already stated, how this film really makes it obvious how lost Hollywood is in its special effects, exaggerated emotionalism, and major climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism. Much of what these characters are going through is implied in the scene, rather than being explained in verbal dialogues. One aspect I really liked about the film was the contrast between the two brothers, one so overtly expressive in their childish way and the other completely stoic, but both capable of evoke deep emotions. The older brother needed to say little, as usual, it was all there in that expressionless face of yours! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, great direction! To not lose!
