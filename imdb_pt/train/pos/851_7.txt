Pierce Brosnan drank his last Martini and returns, in a scandalous self-parody, as Julian Noble, the crazed old crazed murderer who has a special affection for teenage girls, bullfights and coarse clothes. During a job in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a straight-ahead suburban business man from Denver who is in town to make his living in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's crude and insensitive comments, they become friends. Mostly played by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard has revealed that he did not write the film with Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can hardly imagine without him. He proves to have a real talent for comedy and may be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene where the two meet in a brilliant hotel bar (beautiful scenery and beautifully photographed) is really a brave piece of acting. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it has probably been scripted with care, the two actors are largely improvising, but they manage to do wonderfully well! It almost seems like a new standard in screen acting. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS improvising and adding one of the subtler fundamentals of many genre cliches and the actors' own typing (the Brosnan James Bond in particular), and you got one of the most delicious pairings in Hollywood recent. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story runs out after a while. After an hour, the movie runs out of power. However, and I can not put the finger exactly, I really enjoyed it. It looks very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of scenery and lighting, and some tips for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters do not have much to do, but this film offers something new, in this respect almost effortlessly can mix all the conventional genres in a very fun parody. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
