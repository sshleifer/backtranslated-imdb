A very good war movie showing the effects of the war on a hometown boy who loses his vision in Guadalcanal and must return home and readjust himself with the help of family and friends. A great cast of actors helps make this movie so much fun. Eleanor Parker's role as a girlfriend deserved an Oscar nomination. She has so much innocence for her in this movie. Ann Doran's role was equally satisfying, as were all her small supporting roles. I especially like the aura of Phildelphia's hometown before the war. The hunting scene is very good. Of course the war scene on Guadalcanal really showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. A very deserving movie and one that should not be forgotten
