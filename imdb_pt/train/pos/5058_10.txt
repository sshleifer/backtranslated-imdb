There should be more movies about our Native Americans. I particularly think that using real Native Americans would be the right thing. I know this Archie Belaney, who was played by Pierce Brosnan, did a great job playing this character, since he was English. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to put more American Indians in the roles and never use anyone else. The Sioux Nation was put in the background for a long time. Their poverty is a shame for our country. It is my firm conviction that our country must return the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return its land to the Arabs, but we make no effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
