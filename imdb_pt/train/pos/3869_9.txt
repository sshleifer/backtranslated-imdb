I saw the movie in Viennale a few years ago where the audience liked it. I also liked it, the performance of the Summer Phoenix still haunts me, which is why I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in London around 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She tries desperately to become one, but it is not before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage, that she has talent and that she connects with the public and emerges as a stronger human being. <br /> <br /> There were certain criticisms, if their performance was crushed, they accused her of being boring, unable to bring life to her character. I think that's her strong point, that's exactly what Esther Kahn should be, and Phoenix makes the bold decision to make her a very boring girl. So his transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great, the images of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was at that time. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my opinion is the length of the movie, you lose touch with the characters, after all you just find the actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the movie. It's from Phoenix's credit that we did not lose interest in the movie after the first hour.
