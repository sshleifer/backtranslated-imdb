Name just says it all. I watched this movie with my father when he left and having served in Korea, he had great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this movie is that it only focuses on a short period of man's life - interestingly the whole man's life would have made a bio epic photo which is amazing imagine the cost for the production. <br /> <br /> Some posters dodge man's imperfect features, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just a chattering word on the lips of a high-ranking official - it is the profound statement of a man's total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck being the liberal who received a better understanding of man. He does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the human side of man.
