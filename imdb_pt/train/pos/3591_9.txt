I've never bothered to see this movie in theaters, though I remember hearing the name several times. I finally watched this week and what a treat. For some reason, I was hoping it was not very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stayed with him and then I was completely drawn in. I read many of the comments from other reviewers and it struck me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that she is a real fighter in life. All she needs to do is find her place where she is and the ring helps her get there. A very clever story and I'm surprised that this is the first time for Michelle Rodriguez - what a great job she did. Adrian and his coach were also very good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit rough around the edges, but it does not matter at all. The story, the will and the performances completely overcome any flaws (which usually come with independent films). A compelling portrait of a girl meeting and triumphing over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
