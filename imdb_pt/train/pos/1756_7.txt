'' The 40-year-old virgin '' 'made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it's considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the nerd virgin Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax is one of the coolest, especially because it's real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this film are well known or already famous, by the way. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a little strange and collects lots of toys, but he seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends at work, they find out that Andy is indeed ... a virgin! And he's already 40! After this startling revelation, all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman ... the problem is the messes that Andy walks in, especially now that he's really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when he was shopping . a DVD player in the store where he works.
