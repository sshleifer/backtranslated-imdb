Great acting from Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopics to hit the screen in a while. Although it covers most of Bettie's young life, she also manages to stay on a more concentrated path, something that most biographical films do not seem to have. There is some enchanting and frighteningly funny subtext in dialogue and acting. This movie is an excellent break from "American Psycho" Dir., And I think this will be shown as her best work to date. Oh, and as a movie buff, I give 100% film in the film department. It was amazing how they got a 50's look with modern movies. Compliments to D.O.P. All very pleasant. I would highly recommend anyone interested to see it: 8/10.
