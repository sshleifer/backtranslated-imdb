I remember watching this for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers." This movie is still great. An original aspect was that the fighting scenes were very short. Implying that the "barbarian brothers" were so good that they would take out their enemies quickly! Also, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon and yes even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad and that is why it is not a ten, also the story line received a lot of criticism. I think it's very original. Not many films in their genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
