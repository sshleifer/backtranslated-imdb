I love the doodles. My son has been watching them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as to a concert from yesterday (connecticut). He loves them. Scribbles do not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? TV should not teach your kids about numbers or the alphabet. parents should. Leave it behind. Doodlebops really can sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and at the concert you can say that all 3 of them have nice voices and do not sing. Imagine, they dance, jump and sing. they have talent, kids love it and I even like to watch the show. This show is by far the best show on TV for kids. And a rock band for kids. How incredible is that? Why are people saying that Chad (rooney) is gay? Where did you hear that from? Whether he is or not, he is incredible! Leave him alone. It's not as if he or anyone else was promoting homosexuality for our children!
