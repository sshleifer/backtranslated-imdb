It takes patience to overcome the eccentric chronicle of David Lynch, but - for a change - to affirm the life of Alvin Straight's journey, but to continue with it. Although he moves as slowly as Straight's John Deere, when he meets strangers in the course of his pilgrimage, we learn a great deal about the isolation of aging, painful regrets and secrets, and finally family power and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth covers his career with the most genuine performance of the year, sad and poetic, flaccid and affectionate. And Sissy Spacek matches him as her "slow" daughter, Rose, who yearns for her own loss while caring for her father. Rarely has a modern movie preached so positively about the family.
