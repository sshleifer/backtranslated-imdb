"Panic in the Streets" is a little-known film by director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as "The Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947, before that movie, so it was not completely unknown at the time. Still "Panic in the Streets" is mostly a film that went unnoticed. <br /> <br /> The best of this film is the Oscar-winning screenplay. He has a very good concept and his excellent suspense material with a sniff of crime / film-noir elements. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is quite unknown (especially at the time it was released), but still features Zero Mostel and Jack. Palance in one of his first film roles. Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful face. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie drags a little on some points. The film begins very well, but after the beginning the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of rhythm and the point of view of the story. Still, "Panic in the Streets" remains a perfectly watchable film, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes the film a believable one to watch. For fans of the thriller genre, this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
