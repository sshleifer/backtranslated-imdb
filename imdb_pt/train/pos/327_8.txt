I read a comment that labeled this movie "junk" and "a waste of time." I think this person took his political panties pulled a little too much. <br /> <br /> I just rented the new Criterion Yellow and Blue DVD. <br /> <br /> These films - though hardly large - have become at least of historical interest in the so-called "radical student" <br /> <br /> political-social movement of the late 1960s. > <br /> I had not seen any image and its notorious reputation, I was expecting some real porn (there are none). nudity (including male non-verboten frontal nudity (automatic NC-17 - the Orwellian-X) in the US But I was not expecting the movies <br />> <br /> socialist democratic message in his face. > <br /> Although I tended to simplistically, I thought that he occasionally made his points well. <br /> <br /> Both movies occasionally had me laughing loud <br /> <br /> and the director's comment made it clear that there was too much parody <br /> <br /> <br /> The first scene of this kind is very realistic.The main couple is clumsy, inept, funny and captivating in their first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> The second - which has caused most of the complaints - falsified <br /> cunnilingus and fellatio. <br /> <br /> And the latter is the end of an angry fight, which is believable. <br /> <br /> extras include an informative introduction to the film, an interview with the original American distributor and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> excerpts from the testimony in the USA and a "diary" commentary by the director on some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that the "blue noses" would not leave alone and led to the fundamental <br /> <br /> pattern that is fortunately still standing. <br /> <br /> Those with an interest in the quirks of history will find it an obligation to see.
