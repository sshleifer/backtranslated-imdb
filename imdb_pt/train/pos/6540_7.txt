To be honest, I had to go see this movie backwards, I did not expect much, but, hey, I was not fooled, I had a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is a cool breeze, despite some facts that they have tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but this reminded me of those youthful films of the 60s-70s of Europe and Quebec, where they succeed have children interacting with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old boy tries to do justice trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, since her father had business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. Kind of like the chubby kid, who at first is naively taken to support his sister's banter for Nancy, but in the end, he found Nancy pretty cool to be with her even with her affairs ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the support cast is great, and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mom (she did this in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, Dump it, it's fun!
