Contrary to some comments, mine is positive. This movie involves the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, others you do not like. Some are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not simple, happy with everything and everyone, kind of life - very much like real life. Some story lines do not evolve, they just happen. But as true families and good friends, they stay together. Parents who want to buy a baby are such holes! You're happy in the end. Poor Delmar is trapped between a rock and a boulder caring for herself, her mother, her child, and trying to keep her life together. This does not end with a walk at dusk or a house in the suburbs and everyone is living in a world of dreams, but it is a very real picture of the lives of people who live day by day, month by month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie !!
