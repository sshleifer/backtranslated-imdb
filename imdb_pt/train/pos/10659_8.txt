"I like more cheap perfume, it does not last that long ..." - Ralph Meeker (Lawson) tells this to the character Helen of Barbara Stanwyck, after he feels the perfume she chose for her husband in Tijuana .. .! This line took me by surprise, and it also seemed like a metaphor for this movie - what a cheap is better than expensive, because a man who loves cheap perfume and who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have the long term ! I agree with some of the other reviews posted about Helen's attraction to Lawson. Even though her narration claims that she wants Lawson to be removed, she seems drawn to his fiery nature, and that passion he provoked in her would probably not be carried away by the tide!
