This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave a note 10. The story is of the famous "Bushwhackers" outside of Missouri who fought alongside the South during the War Between States. The clothes they wore were authentic, the story and why they fought is very precise and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they represented ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well chosen and either the brightest of the actors or the director really knows how to get the best of them. I suspect it was a combination of great direction, super cast to find the right people and excellent performance by the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really stirred! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and story, all in one movie. He even has the future Spider-Man and Jewel. And she's good!
