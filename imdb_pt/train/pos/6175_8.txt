I saw this pilot when he was shown for the first time, and I'm sure countless fans of "Spirit" hate him because, like Batman, Green Hornet, etc., he took the character in the direction of "camp." But I evidently never had enough of Batman, because I thought it was fun, just like that show. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny's partner was fatally injured, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood up for the law, and obeying the exact letter of it. Then he says something like: "Boy, I was stupid!" What's his way of telling Denny to become a watcher, what he does (despite the TV Batman type). Then there is the scene in which he tries to seduce the villain to let him go kissing her, but she is not cheated because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a great example of "camp", which was also "underestimated" by both the actor and the actress.
