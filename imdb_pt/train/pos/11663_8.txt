The Secret of Kells is an independent and animated film that gives us one of the legendary stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript of the Middle Ages that presents the four Gospels of the New Testament. I did not know that this book really exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier. There are some stories and ideas about how the book came about, who wrote it, and how it survived for over a thousand years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives in the Abbey of Kells, Ireland, with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach is building a huge wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan does not like the wall or the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, something that Abbot Cellach has no more time for. He fears the "Norse," those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burned to the ground. <br /> <br /> One day, a traveler comes from the island of Iona, near Scotland. It is Brother Aidan, a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished. Abbot Cellach grants him permission to stay and Brendan relates to him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First he needs ink for the book, but it does require specific berries. The only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest, an area outside Brendan's boundaries. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to flee and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the woods, Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. forest. It allows Brendan's passage to the berries and along the way becomes similar to your company. She warns him about the impending danger in the dark and not to frustrate him. There are worse things than the Vikings out there. From there, Brendan is faced with more challenges with the book and the imminent certainty of the invasion. <br /> <br /> I like the story much more now that I know what it's all about. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, the animation makes perfect sense. I'm sure you've seen photos or copies of ancient texts from hundreds of years ago, with ruffled edges, colorful pictures and extravagant patterns, creatures and writings that adorn the pages. Much like the opening pictures of Disney's The Sword in the Stone. The animation here contains many similar designs and patterns. Creates a unique viewing experience where story and animation almost try to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I could not take my eyes off the incredible detail. This is one of the best 2D animations I've seen in years. It is vibrant, stimulating and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by drawings, doodles and patterns on trees, on walls and in the air, just floating around. Raises the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfying, though I think the ending could have been a bit more complicated. With a run time of only 75 minutes, I think it could have been something special in the final act. It does not give much information nor does it allude to the importance of the book. We are reminded that it is important, but we never fully understand it. They tell us it gives hope, but never why or how. That was really the only missing part of the movie. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting, though completely overtaken by the animation. <br /> <br /> I think it's okay to some extent. The animation can take a movie so far before it falls short. The story lacks some parts, but it's interesting to see a fascinating part of the story. I would recommend looking briefly at the Book of Kells just to get an idea of ​​what I and this movie are talking about. I think it will greatly help your viewing experience. This is a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that definitely should not be missed.
