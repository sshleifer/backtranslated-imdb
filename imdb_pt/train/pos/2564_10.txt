Personally, I think Sayonara was the biggest movie he ever made. He touched all the emotions, from rage to romance, to complete the tragedy. And Brando should have won as best actor. Anyway, the movie is amazing, the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! Do this and fall in love.
