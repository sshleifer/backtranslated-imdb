"What would you do?" is a question that will linger in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional Brokedown Palace. You're also going to wonder if Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - an issue that was not resolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly well-executed and beautifully filmed film. Although it is slow at times, its rhythm is reflective of the plot - but much of the film will leave you at the tip of your seat; wondering what happens next. The ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the role of the main characters, who are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also commendable.
