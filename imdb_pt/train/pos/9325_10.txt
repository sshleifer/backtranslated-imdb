I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who finally saw each other after their father passed away. Ryan and Theo at first discuss who did what. But later, Theo learns that his brother Ryan is not only gay but is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time fixing their differences. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing movie. I only saw Colm Feore in the 7th season of 24, but he was terrific at it. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard of before, did a phenomenal job as well. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is a movie you can not miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
