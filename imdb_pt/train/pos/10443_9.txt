Richard Linklater's beautifully directed blend of youthful romance and travel diary from Paris is one of the best-looking romantic movies of the 1990s. Julie Delpy becomes one of the decade's most engaging presentations as the Parisian girl who spends one day with Ethan Hawke, a stranger on a train. The dialogue (and there is a lot of it) is sometimes winding and overly precious, but this portrait of two young aspiring lovers making a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, moving and insightful moments.
