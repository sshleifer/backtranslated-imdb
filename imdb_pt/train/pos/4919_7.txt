The noir of Kazan cinema won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go in extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rank it very well. I can almost see where they're coming from. But I'd rather have a more attenuated approach to a long forgotten film that seems to have been run on virtually no budget and almost documentary form. The pneumonic plague is loosened on the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to arrest the main bearer (Palance). The film is grumpy, filmed in black and white, and makes very good use of the venues. Widmark is wonderful as always. Forget symbolism (crime equals disease and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy to watch a movie like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short (post-WWII in the early 1950s) and probably will not be of interest to the casual observer of movies. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase in the end. It's something else and, frankly, I do not know how they filmed part of it. I can say that it probably took as long to film the final as the first 90% of the film.
