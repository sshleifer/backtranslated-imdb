They will sympathize with the poor little girl that the greatest desire is to have a little doll to love. And the poor rich boy who just wants to spend time with his parents always away. And what child does not know someone in school who is like nasty boys who are recruited by the Pitch to help catch Santa Claus and ruin Christmas? In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, gets exactly what they deserve at Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will please children both to Santa Claus and the message of love he gives to people around the world. <Br /> <br />
