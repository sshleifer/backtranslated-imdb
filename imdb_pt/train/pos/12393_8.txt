For those who were interested in knowing exactly how mankind came to be wrapped in large red pods that make me crave pomegranate, there are the double of the short "Second Renaissance." I do not know exactly why they are split into two parts, especially because they are credited as one on the DVD (and these shorts are seen in any other format except the DVD?), But they are informative even if they have some gaps. <br /> <br /> What really makes this first part stand out, the second part and the rest of the animations, are the parallels it shows between the robot revolt and civil rights. Graphic homages to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the March of the Million of Men and the complex of God of humanity. In fact, "God" is never really referenced by these short, instead replaced by "image of man himself". <br /> <br /> As for the short films entering the collection, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is by far the most effective at bringing emotion. It is a painful and disturbing view of humanity's potential to become "the architect of its own destruction." Some may be deactivated by some of the concepts that this short rips directly from previously established science fiction literature, but again, this is basically what most of the Matrix series did, and has been a driving force behind their success. <Br/> <br /> --PolarisDiB
