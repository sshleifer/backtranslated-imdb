I read Blaise's modesty several years ago, collecting numbers from the strip. After the fiasco movie made many years ago, based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie not based on action or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How Modesty was created on the basis of the story itself and what parts of her life were affected by her childhood. I think these thoughts will give a better understanding to the next film (I hope). I simply loved the old-fashioned style of the movies. <br /> <br /> However, everything was not so good, the game was not so good. almost boring and unreal. The performance could also have been improved. I'm not thinking that the bad guy in this movie looked real, the only reason he was there was so Modesty could have someone tell his story. Also they could have expanded the movie, showing more about when she will build "The Net", but I think it's for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me for my lousy English.
