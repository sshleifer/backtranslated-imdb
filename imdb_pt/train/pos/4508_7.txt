I was impressed by the beautiful photograph of this film, which was filmed in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see many activities in which Eskimos are involved, such as hunting, dancing, building iglus etc. And their customs, like offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in history. Hunting sequences were sometimes filmed, since it was easy to recognize some animal rear-projection scenes, but even these were fascinating. Underwater fishing for salmon, walrus hunting, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the flavor of the documentary. The filmmakers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was translated by someone on the screen or by subtitles. The introduction stated that, with the exception of white merchants and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos of birth, but they were professional actors with credits for previous films and you could see that sometimes they had makeup. But they were excellent at their roles and started to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a look.
