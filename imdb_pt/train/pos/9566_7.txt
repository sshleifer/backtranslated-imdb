Ultra-Shadow Crime Drama by Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home." However, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill," though it's not as polished as that. However, it is a wraparound and imperfect chaos over a lone Cambodian, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While escaping from the scene, he kills police partner Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam initiates a crazy and obsessive hunt for the man by Pang that results in almost a dozen . corpses and ruthless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans hitting each other lately. That's a nasty and nasty thing, and that's why I'm so partial to it, and I applaud your pessimistic vibe. It's visually stunning and the design of the sound is unique. Dramatically, everything turns down until each character finds himself in a world of sharp pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and generates a fourth surprise act that bears a beautiful act of grotesque surgery.
