This film tells the story of a romance between the niece Albert Einstien and a gas station attendant. In order to join the two, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins, of the Hudsucker Proxy) learn to act smarter. That impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered a genius. Hilarity follows. To not lose. Filmed in Mercer County, New Jersey, Princeton University, Lawrenceville Prep School (doubling for Princeton University) as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in Hopewell.
