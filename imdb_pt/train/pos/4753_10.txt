In a series full of brilliant episodes, this stands out as one of my favorites. It is not the deepest episode, there is no great meaning or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are some great performances. <br /> <br /> But what really sets me apart is that it is, to my knowledge, the only Twilight Zone episode with a double snapper ending. The Zone is rightly famous for providing a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time, you have a surprise, and think that's it, but it turns out that there is another surprise waiting. I like it so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper, more message-oriented).
