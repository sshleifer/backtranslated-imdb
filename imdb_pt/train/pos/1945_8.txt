This latest Voyager episode begins 23 years into the future. Voyager came home. In the many years it took to return, the minds of the Vulcan Tuvoks were destroyed. He carried a disease that they came too late to heal. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. She realizes, there is a Warp Conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could take Voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify Voyager. There is a problem. The channel is at the bottom of the Borg Space. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. He is like a child. He scribbles, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, is convinced that they are important in some way. At the institution, Tuvok cries, asking for "Janeway" to please, please go back to him. Janeway decides to run a federation bus and equip him with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the Borg in hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide Voyager to the Warp Conduit . <br /> <br /> When she goes back in time and connects with Voyager, Janeway finds her younger self. The two captains disagree, discussing the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok asking if it is true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits that it is true, but can not be cured by the ship's facilities, so he kept it to himself. <br /> <br /> The young captain agrees with the plan of the older captains. To increase your chances of success, the elder Janeway plans to distract the Borg with their transport ship. The Borg actually capture Janeway and his space shuttle. The Borg Queen personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected this! the Borg queen has assimilated a virus in herself that kills her. With Queen Borg, the dead Voyager causes her to pass through the Warp Conduit back into federation space.
