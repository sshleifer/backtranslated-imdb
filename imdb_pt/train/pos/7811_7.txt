Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority that ruled South Africa in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's Cry Freedom movie is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as about Donald Woods, the editor of the white liberal newspaper who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film takes a sharp change in view after Biko dies in prison for tortuous behavior at the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose between doing the right thing and fleeing the country to publish books about Biko or allowing his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to press him to forget the books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a pattern by the numbers that escape the boundary wire after Biko's death. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good at only his fourth film, Biko, but something is wrong with a movie that tries to portray the Apartheid fights, focusing more on the judgments of a white family for more than half the film. Attenborough would have served his topic better, concentrating on Biko's rise to prominence, instead of starting where Biko became friends with Woods. Maybe a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour movie was not conducive to big box office, but the movie was a huge box office failure anyway. Leaving aside the cinematographic policy, the film still entertains and sends one or two messages, although in a sanitized way for the PG. *** of 4 stars.
