An inventive and suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that poses a difficult challenge by being fully defined in two rooms. Not completely successful, but tense, surprising and well-acted. Can you find the movie a little reminiscent of SAW ?? two men stuck in the bedroom and putting one against the other? but unlike the movie, he dares keep his premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the movie. It's like watching a lab experiment. Some may find the suspense contained boring, but this reviewer found it fascinating. The sound and images of the film are incredibly well done. This is certainly a good movie to showcase a good home video system. Just right for a movie night fest, when one is in paranoid mood. It certainly kept me awake that night.
