I had seen Lady with Red Hair when it appeared, and I did not remember it as something to love. The truth is that, despite its basis in a true story, its screen is silly and unbelievable. The true merit of the image is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 1930s and '40s form a backdrop to the delicate and clever work of the ever-underrated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful and spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing to image. What an actor! He has never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady with Red Hair contains your best work in movies. See and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
