This movie almost surprised me. I did not have very high expectations for this, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They did not spend much time reworking the past, so they were not relying on the success of the old TV show to bring the movie. Overall was great fun. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly comedy and I think I can agree with her.
