Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on the screen and this could be their best movie together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be tacky and predictable, but that's not what I love about the movie. I love seeing Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are simply wonderful. It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and this is part of what makes this movie so wonderful. <br /> <br /> The witty dialogue, the great script, and the attention to detail are the other things that make it so good. movie. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and at every subsequent viewing I always notice at least one new detail. For me, that's a mark of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and script are better than most films of this period (early thirties). I love classic movies, but I admit that most of them are just average and sometimes I do not care. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a 'pre-coding' movie. (The Hays code was not applied until a year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not have been done under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank God the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we would have lost this gem.
