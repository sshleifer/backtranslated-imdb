It is no surprise that Busey developed a tumor in her sinus cavity, this film is also a bad decision, but I totally enjoyed it. The first 5 minutes are the 5 most uninspired minutes of any movie; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a posture of Spider-Man, Busey screams the best worst line in any movie ever created ... "your worst nightmare, mascot!" I spit some of my eggs laughing so hard. This line resonates so well that it even surpasses Clooney's infamous "Hi Freeze, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments are Busey constantly getting upset by people reminding him that he killed his former CIA partner ... which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all possible thanks to a super slow-motion flashback sequence that makes watching dry paint looks exciting). There's an ashtray for the fingers, punches on the face and "this was not my fault and you know it!" Well, the footage shows he's missing the thug and hitting on his friend, so ... Other loud moments out loud have to be your ex-girlfriend dropping a grenade on the floor to allow her escape - a plan that defies everyone logical, physical and absurd. And finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderstorm during the intense guerrilla warfare and starts running and gets in the way of a small object, I almost got wet. Some of Busey's best works by far, rent or buy it today "butthorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (in the poo meter that is).
