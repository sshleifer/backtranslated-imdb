This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that many people do not want to see movies that are not loaded with broken arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the New York phone book. This movie is neither. It's clich√©, it's formula, but it's also fun. It does not ask you to think, it does not require you to accept the film as a reality. He simply does what a good movie should do, that he willingly suspends disbelief for two hours and seize the adventure. The cast is good, although not excellent. As another commentator pointed out, the John Williams soundtrack was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that much of the film was filmed in Huntsville at the actual space camp made it even more believable. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that the original release of the film was postponed for a few months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a big part in its original theatrical opening, but the film eventually helped to focus the dreams of many young people back to space and the possibilities that are in it. So, sit down with your kids and get ready to enjoy.
