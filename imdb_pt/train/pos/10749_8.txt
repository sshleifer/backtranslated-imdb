I rented this for my son who recently found interest on 9/11. He was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding. I liked the way it was told as a "documentary". If there was a movie that I would recommend seeing about September 11, this would be the one! Usually you see a movie that has actors that are well known. This movie had no one known. Also, you watch a movie about September 11, you hear about a firefighter or two losing their lives saving people. I did not feel like this had any of that! I just rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done indeed! My heart goes out to the survivors and families of the September 11 victims!
