This is a little police drama that fills its 65-minute long. It has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a weary middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his rookie partner Tobin (John Miles), a somber killer about love and even love for Tobin in the form of a Mary Botanist (Patricia Wright), who helps solve the crime. There is also an excellent end to shooting that takes place in a patio of stone cutters. Stay tuned for a great fool near the beginning of this movie, where Lieutenant Corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'Tatooed Tilly'. 'BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confused, right?). Also later, when Tobin is chasing the killer through the backyards, he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did not hit him!
