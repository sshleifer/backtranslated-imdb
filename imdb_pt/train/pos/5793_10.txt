Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a true adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before beginning the actual story of the movie, we have a presentation of the Bad Tour (Man in the Mirror), and a great movie begins. After that, we have a kind of Michael carrier collage, as it was until Moonwalker left in 1988. After some Music Videos also (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are being chased by the "Big Mr." story thug because they have discovered their evil plans to take children around the world with drugs. During the chase, we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels films for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the kids is kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will have to save her before she gets a drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the film we see special effects not only amazing by today's standards but also stunning today. For example, watch Michael turn into a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with a Come Together performance (later published on HIStory's double Michaels album), and you leave the movie with a magical feel. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this to every family who wants to spend a good night along with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say, "But Michael Jackson is a suspected child molester!" Yes, he is indeed, but come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see..
