Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it difficult to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator that takes her back to the late eighteenth century. she knows two other children who have lost their father and face poverty ... <br /> <br /> I was clicking the channels and I found this ... I read the synopsis and suddenly I saw Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought .... and watched the movie .. I did not know that Elisha had made movies before .... 'The Next Girl Door and 24' Elisha provides satisfactory performance, the plot is a bit tacky, but the movie works .. It's amazing how this young girl became the hottest girl in Hollywood!
