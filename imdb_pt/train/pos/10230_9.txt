People forget that there have been several beheadings of King Kong - Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all cheat, but the YETI stands on its own. He only borrows an element from King Kong and that is the attraction of the animal to a woman. <br /> <br /> The myth of YETI is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists have fascinated him. there was, but no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth seeing. The first time I watched it was in Elvira's "Mistress of the Dark Shows" in the early 80's. It sent shivers up my spine as a child, especially when YETI got mad. I saw it again, around 1:00 AM on ABC, about 2 to 3 years ago. Seeing him again made me enjoy it more, has some good general effects (for his time) and the story involves a dumb boy and his dog, and an evil entrepreneur who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes. Also the song is really cool, it's very similar to YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a great monster like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half in 10.
