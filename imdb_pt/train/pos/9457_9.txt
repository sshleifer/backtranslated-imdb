How can you summarize exactly how good and right it feels and play in this movie? For several weeks this DVD jumped off the shelf for me every time I went into the store - having seen Steve Carrell in some movies earlier, I did not want to tarnish my thinking process from him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I caught up with " What the hell!" attitude! And how surprised! I just wish I had bought it sooner. Having watched it three times in two days, I am still smiling like the representation of a widower struggling with three daughters, longing for what has been missing since the death of his beloved wife, who thus finds an intriguing woman, enchanting her in such a way. in a profound and interesting way (dare I say collector?), throws a totally different light on life that makes him realize that it is what he has been looking for. <br /> <br /> The problem of this woman being his sister, the girl complicates matters - portraying Dan comically shy and with a sincere heartbreak, seeing his "special someone" bringing so much fun and pleasure to the family home, as well as the lives of his brothers. You really start to feel for it. So when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - this is the turning point in Marie's estimation of Dan !! The look she gives him when he repeats his comment, about not liking Ruthie - pure Green-Eye Monster! Unleashing an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the best worked, as Dan begins to loosen up in relation to Marie. Other stormy scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, confronted by his brothers, begins to describe what just happened ... when Dan's face falls, he brings a gasping breath! <br /> <br /> Your youngest daughter, Lilly, is making the gift by celebrating her love for Suzanne, her late wife, A little sincere affection and a little sip as Dan notices just what he lost in his life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays guitar and sings on the Talent Show ... his voice breaks slightly as he replays the song. Absolute gem! <br /> <br /> The acceptance of what happens at the end of the film by his daughters ... all three love his father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny his love for Marie; Dan's hopelessness does not fail with his daughters because he is his rock, his fortress ... and tell him much more than that with just a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I'll leave it for now - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future ... but I'll end by saying ... <br /> <br /> ... if you want to watch a movie this is so good with comedic twists to brighten up the drama, it never seems forced or coarse, it appears like a genuine portrait of a man discovering a new life - not just with a woman , but also with your extended family, so look no further. DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well-acclaimed cinematic experience with a soundtrack by Sondre Lerche that takes you everywhere without ever being intrusive with beautiful cast performances. I can not wait to watch this again !!
