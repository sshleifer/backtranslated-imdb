This is hard to watch - as a previous reviewer says. This is incredible considering the terrible films that came out shortly after World War II - particularly the "liberation" of Dachau. Of course, in the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a "transport" is vivid, almost as if based on real news (the Nazis liked to register their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He traces the course of a Nazi career. This mapping is particularly revealing when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans, at first laughing at Hitler, then incredulous, and finally helpless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi official into an anti-Nazi position. This happened, as evidenced by the various attempts against Hitler, most notably the plot of Staffenberg that occurred when this film was being launched. A strong movie, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting the Nuremberg and other tracks that would occur when the war ended.
