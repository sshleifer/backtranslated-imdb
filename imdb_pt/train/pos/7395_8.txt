Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathroom in China. There are no extravagant scenarios, explosions or glamorous people - just good writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, note!). <br /> <br /> A distant son returns home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Daddy looks good and is doing the family business as usual. In fact, he realizes that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close, caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visitor's son is from the big city and really does not see the value of the old bathroom. How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is an action movie (like those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), as I particularly do not care about these frantic films. The shower as well as the spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese movies about people!
