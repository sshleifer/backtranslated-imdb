I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to release "The Dawn." It was a great look at how strangers try to get inside to make it great. <br /> <br /> The story was well organized and organized in an interesting way that made the movie flow well. Certainly worth a watch. My only complaint is that their seemed to be no closure. Maybe that's part of the point. We hope, but in reality is not what happened (or usually happens). The film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer out of their Canadian television show. You can see a little of what is yet to come. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing The Papal Chase.
