... in our home. Like everyone who commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4 years old at the time) and I (10) would watch this movie several times. We all love Star Wars, but we always come back to this because of the great songs and the adventure. We all loved Camel and sang at the top of his lungs during his song. There are a few slow moments (the time spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we usually get bored after The Knight's song ("The reason I {sound effect} is because Iooooooove you"), but we we loved the journey to rescue Babbette and the end and everyone was a bit scared with the image of King Koo-Koo floating there dominating the entire horizon, laughing madly at the end. I still sing today "Hooray for me! Paris gay babbette!" around my friends (I'm 33 now) who just stare at me like I've lost my mind; however, when I'm singing, I'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of Star Wars.
