This is a real eye drop. A world made of floating islands and flying old cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is to cast cathedrals against their opponents ... Who can resist this? An old prophecy, a lot of lost heroes and a cute princess looking for her hero ... looks familiar ...? Yes we've heard this song before. But you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you'll be looking forward to a little more history. <br /> <br /> What lies behind the 30 year circle? What drove the knight mad? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart? And besides that group of farmers, where are the people? Actually, this image looks so intriguing, but it's not the Lord of the Rings.
