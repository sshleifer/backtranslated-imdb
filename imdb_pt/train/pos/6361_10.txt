I have eagerly anticipated the opening of this movie for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could turn into Seuss's Grinch and make his character his own. I was not dissapointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master at his craft and no one could have played that role to perfection as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children and this movie will surely become a timeless classic for everyone to enjoy in the next few years. I already have visions of my young daughter sitting year after year to watch this video remake, and no doubt I will watch with her and laugh the first time I saw her. <br /> Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written on it, and I do not believe I would have joined without it. However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in its own right, most notably the lovely Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect foil for the wiles of Carrey. The setting, the music score and the costumes all lent their hands to a fabulous and magical end product, and I believe everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy task to turn a 22-minute cartoon classic into a live action movie, but Howard succeeded. For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is their hearts that are 2 sizes too small.
