The only other review of this movie from this date actually destroys the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read user reviews to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie about which I do not know much. It's unfortunate when there are not many comments for a particular block, because when there is only one comment and it destroys the movie and cast, you have no idea what to expect. I read the review before seeing this title and I do not know where all the venom came from for this movie and the stars. Douglas and Blondell were very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found the film and the performances fun and enjoyable. Not one of the great classics of all time, but fun and enjoyable fun - far more than you can expect in most recent movies. If you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed.
