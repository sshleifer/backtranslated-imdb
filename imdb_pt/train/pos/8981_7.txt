Excavation! I would tell anyone that even if you do not like Metallica, to see 'some kind of monster' is a documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental children during a collapse. It's fun and fascinating. In the same line comes digging! A movie about 'Dandy Warhol's' and 'The Jonestown Massacre' Two Portland bands that start a sort of musical scene in their hometown just for one of the bands to become big and one to fall on the way to the history of music books. From the outset, the two bands pull in opposite directions only in their ability to make decisions, be they good or bad. Filmed over seven years and sometimes painful to watch we see the meteoric rise of the dandy to fame (thanks to this vodaphone ad!) And Jonestown's seminal drop from scene instigators to contenders. As the bands become more disjointed, friendships are stretched and, at various points, fit into discussions and even on stage fights. All this is kind of funny and kind of tragic and, believe it or not, it's perversely capable of watching. As I said at the beginning, you can watch the Metallica movie even if you have no interest in the band. Excavation! on the other hand it is slightly different and is nicer and much easier to watch if you have a passing interest in any band. Still a good movie and another testament not to be in a band than to encourage it as a career. Excavation! It's a crazy ride on the tails of rock and roll and a good example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.
