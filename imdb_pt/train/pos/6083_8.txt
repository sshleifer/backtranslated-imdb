Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can think to say about it. These are the four most underrated actors in the industry and work wonderfully together. It's like poetry the way they touch and leaks the natural ability to look like they've been best friends for ages even to film the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is good and can be intense enough to see the first time, and the four stars largely help the ability to re-watch. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together onscreen, the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from afar and fill in the vocals, it almost brought a tear to my eyes. <br /> <br /> A good movie, a great cast, go see. Because? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantaline.
