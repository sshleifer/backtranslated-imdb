There are many problems with the Mystery Men. First of all, there are many different characters for everyone to have complex or even interesting personalities. Special effects hurt the story and are not really that special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic and juvenile role as a character who merely farting and speaking with an inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Now about the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shoveler is perfect. The Sphinx is an exceptionally funny character, who is just mysterious and just throws out the traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is a lot of fun too, showing a weak character trying to get into the big leagues of superheroes. All the characters do, and this is an area I found particularly ironic. That's because all the actors are indie actors trying to get into the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the box office is that America does not get irony. All in all, I loved the movie, but I feel it would have worked better if more effort was made to tweak the script, rather than having unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
