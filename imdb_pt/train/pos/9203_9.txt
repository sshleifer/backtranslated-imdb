This is one of Dev Anand's films, which gave great and distinguished films to the Hindu movie industries such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple - a brother seeks out his lost sister. Sister joined the hippies who smoke marijuana and sing Hare Rama hare Krishna. However, the film portrays some of the significant events the world experienced in the 1970s. Hippie culture, its submission to drugs, freedom, flight from duty, family, and adoption of anything new like the Eastern religion (which was new to white). They were treated perfectly. Zeenat gave his best and Dev as always was remarkable. The songs are the most used (on the contrary, they are abused because of songs) in this movie. They were not spoiled. A perfect example is 'Dekho the deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word of the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The ending is tragic, but that's not the essence of the movie. In general, Devji, who believes in making different films, was able to show what he wanted to show here. A must see experience of hippie culture and beautiful Nepal from the 70's.
