Film brilliant, the next best film of The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought into an original VHS and I have not seen this movie for 15 years but still as good as it was back then. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse, but it's the characteristics that make this movie (and many other old-fashioned Chinese kung fu movies) great. The choreography is incredible and the plot is basic. I've never seen Shaolin's 36th camera, but I know it's the same film, but Gordon Liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr Return to The 36th Chamber is played by a different character. It has a lot of comedy and kung-fu brilliant value.
