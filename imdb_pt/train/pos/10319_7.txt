Having read many of the other reviews of this movie in IMDb, there is apparently a consensus among purists that this movie is nothing like the books on which it is based. On this point I can not comment, having never actually read any of the adventures of the protagonists before. However, what I can say for sure, is that it seems to me that many of the said reviewers have certainly gone through a sense of humor; Let's be honest here - this movie is so much fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. so I must admit that the movie is apparently not representative of the character / s, but let's put this in a clear perspective? .. do the same people who are complaining about this movie also regret the fact that the classic 1960s Batman series does not remain true to the original DC Comics character? Or maybe there's still restlessness in the same people that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was so different from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this movie is amazingly camping, but that's exactly what happens. charm! <br /> <br /> Ex-Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the homonym hero in this (and has more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey!) and is backed by a great supporting cast that all seem to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look for a brief but very welcome appearance of Michael Berryman's favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Many to choose from, but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate grasshopper to order coke, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! Also the scene often observed near the end of the film in which Savage tackles his enemy Captain Mares using various martial arts disciplines that are labeled on screen! ??? Invaluable! <br /> <br /> Put simply, the film does not take itself seriously and is even more fun for it. Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the theme song adapted from John Phillip Sousa for days afterwards guaranteed!)
