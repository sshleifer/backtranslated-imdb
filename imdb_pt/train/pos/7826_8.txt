Described as the story of Steve Biko - played excellently by Denzel Washington, as you would expect - this was actually more the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly making Kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good at the role. Attenborough gave this the kind of direction you would expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were the kind that only he could cross. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what turns out to be a sad tale of a South Africa that is not even close to the distant past.
