When I was coffee president of our college, one of our jobs was to review groups and movies for student activities. One of the best things that came out in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was being screened off Broadway in theaters, where television monitors were being placed across the public, so everyone had a great place. The premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis - ward Saturday Night Live, keeping the thing new. They decided to turn it into a film for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was in the movie. Watching him run naked though the forest was a howl. Like many of the reviews before mine, it was Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this vid. I told my 13 year old son about Koko the Clown - He can not wait to get a copy!
