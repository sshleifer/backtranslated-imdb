I saw a trailer for that in Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for African-American movies. It seemed what it is; a highly biased "crazy" comedy in which a tense black man realizes that his son is gay. It seems that the wife of Redd Foxx (RF) left him for his brother, who works with him in the "shop" in Phoenix. He took the bus to visit his son Norman in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So, when radiofrequency arrives, Norman, wearing only blue bikini shorts, comes out of his waterbed to answer the door. Trying to save time by making his aging father climb the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who firmly refuses to budge. It was only to the point where I wrote "Why will not he wake up?" when he suddenly does, and the jaws of me and my friend fell for the first time when we came upon our first glimpse of the blue-eyed Garson and whirlpool, Norman's white lover who simply "had the greatest dream Garson is a flaming queen of a kind that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 LA He has dresses and a bag and great clumsy jewels, and seems to have modeled both his looks and personality in Carol Brady of The Brady Bunch. Norman orders his lover to find another place to stay during his father's visit. <br /> <br /> Garson will stay with Waylon Flowers and Madame answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> While he is on the phone, Garson arrives to pack his dress and RF confronts him.With a burst of 70s soul music to evoke his revelation (but it seems more like we're about to hear a track very special of The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> First impulse is "I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you". So the RF takes a long walk, going through all the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as "Maybe the bathroom has trained him too soon." His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees in his walk, for example, a corpulent truck driver showing up just as he is contemplating what a real man does. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, it should be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought. He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! RF, then, hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this incredible skins thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try heterosexuality, but it angers Norman and he runs off to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> So Garson approaches and offers to take RF out of the night. He sympathizes with the loss of the wife of RF and tells the story of his own mother, who feeds an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because "she was molested in a luau." They participate in a long presentation of Wayon and Madam, culminating in Madam slamming her head against the piano until her hair loosens. Once again, the mouths were wide open. <br /> <br /> So it seems like, you do not know, RF and Garson have a wonderful night together! You see, older, traditional black men only have to see the entertainment of mega-queens of low quality in order to get closer to everything the gay world has to offer! It's really that simple! That still does not stop the RF shouting "Rape!" when Garson wakes him up from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you realize. <br /> <br /> There was so much that just came out. What is the basis of Norman and Garson's relationship? They do not seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms about expelling Garson, and even when he appears to defend himself, he never defends Garson or talks about his relationship. There were some kind of picturesque touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexuality - and sitting on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent actually tries to figure out something about homosexuality instead of just running away to get drunk or whining about their friends. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's exactly what it looks like: a little relic from a bygone era, a time when some gay people thought that if strained and straight people would sit and watch a marionette performance, we could all learn to love and to understand each other! And because of all the naivety of it, extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogues end up coming out as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of discussion about how things have changed for gays in the last 30 years. I think the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk to sleep, and by extension convert them. <br /> <br /> Hey, check out Merde's Cinema, my site about bad and cheesy movies (with some good movies released).
