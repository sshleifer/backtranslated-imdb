I watched this movie once and I can watch it again, but even though Jamie Foxx is good in the movie, I feel like they could have used a less funny character like Alvin Sanders. The scenes of Foxx, for example, in prison when he is confronted by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are very funny. David Morse again is a wonderful portraitist of a cop. Its sturdy, but mostly silent features, are perfect for your paper. Morse once again meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends up falling hard on Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in every movie. I personally love this quality in a movie where the actors end up in the same situation as in a previous movie, as these two did in The Green Mile. Overall it was a very good movie.
