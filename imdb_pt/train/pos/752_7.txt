Four teenagers in a suburb of Los Angeles face all kinds of problems: parties, drugs, police officers, confused parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, more or less her mother's chicken, tries to keep everyone together as "a family" (as the family unit she never had), and the most moving thing about the movie is that it can not. Slowly, everyone grows and leaves. This precise point of the plot, though emphasized everywhere, is unfortunately misrepresented. Do we really need a long run with Scott Baio coming out of a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion." Some of the dialogues, in fact, are frankly illusory, and I do not much care for an issue at the end of the movie, which follows awkwardly from a death to a marriage. But these are the nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about losing a strong bond. And Jodie's face at the end speaks volumes. If viewers choke on the end, the movie won that. It's not worth crying or begging for sympathy. This shows us an example of friendship and we hope to understand. *** in ****
