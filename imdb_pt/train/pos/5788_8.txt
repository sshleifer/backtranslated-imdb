This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There was a holocaust, but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson passed unharmed. Then it becomes a battle for territory. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the survival instinct takes over. It's a silent and slow chess battle as they try to gain confidence. They come to truce, but mistrust takes over and they start over. Of course the male feminine role of the 1960s comes on the scene and modern viewers may find their need to follow it a bit offensive. But it is still captivating and interesting. Because she does not speak, we do not know the mind here very well, but in the end we can guess.
