The reason people say that this movie scared them is because it happened !! This means that the purpose of the film was felt by some who saw it. When I first saw this movie, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a type of blood and blood film, but the kind you think might be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. Of course, non-believers will say it's just a science fiction movie. The truth is that this film is mandatory for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious outlook. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen .. etc) this is one of them and is a must have. I've never seen the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I believe this happens where this movie ends.
