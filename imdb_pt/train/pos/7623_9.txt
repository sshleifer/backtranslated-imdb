Although originally reluctant to jump on the wave of watching "Lost," I accidentally caught an episode at the beginning of Season 1 - the one with the polar bear - and it has since caught my attention. The show, this is it. Not the polar bear. So, upload (hehe) with me as I dismiss as many senseless and coherent compliments as I can find. "Lost" has a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people crashing into a desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to their premise, exploring each character deeply and inflexibly - what drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island in which they are trapped acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are fleeing from something (Sawyer and Kate, among others) or coming into contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But "Lost" also extends the island itself and the mysterious horrors it houses ... and they all seem to be strangely connected. <br /> <br /> Although television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or glamor. acting skills, most of the cast of "Lost" are actually spectacular actors to their respective parts, projecting heart and humor into their performances. There is also a plethora of eyecandy, but generally not Hollywood type plastic like most TV shows. All the characters feel very real and are extremely attractive to watch. Are their interactions rarely prey to a predictable mood, petty arguments, or tacky melodrama (though they are irritatingly secretive)? these people are, first and foremost, trying to survive and any relationship that seems is treated as secondary to the action. The realism of these characters facilitates an already well-carved plot. <br /> <br /> On this plot ... Imagine a tree as the plot of the template, then the branches as subplots (in this case, a branch for each character)? well, Lost adds branches to each branch and then tiny branches to those branches, like other story lines. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters in flashbacks, you will have your own story. If you are a DOG, you will have your own storyline. Unless the writers get them all together in a glorious culmination in the end, they are getting ready. I'm more than a little worried that there will be some disappointment for this show, as I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But supposing the writers do, "Lost" is arguably the best show ever on television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
