"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this is the most successful Cinema Parallel Hard Hitting that has also become a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration to all the top directors in India. <br /> <br /> The film tells the real-life scenario of the Mumbai Police of the 1970s. Unlike any Police in other cities in India, the Mumbai Police completely embodies a different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Plan with real approach of Bombay Police. <br /> <br /> Among several police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded police officer from a poor family. Your father is a tough cop. Anand suffers from the ideologies and incidences of his father over the atrocities of his father to his mother. Anand's approach to immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own professional satisfaction. The film here is twisted into a plot where Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled underfoot by his superiors. This leads to frustration, since he can not achieve the desired professional satisfaction. Resulting from frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the rooms and bars of pre-trial detention, turning him into an alcoholic as well. <br /> <br /> The Spirit within him is still alive as he constantly struggles with the system. He is aware of the subway system, where police and politicians are inherently associated from afar. Their commitment to unethical practice is negative. Finally, it is suspended. <br /> <br /> Direction is a masterpiece and a completely hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand invades the house of Ramalho's gangster, Rama Shetty, to arrest him, followed by a short talk that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments. <br /> <br /> The practical approach to Script is a great Punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, disappointments are all part of the Mumbai police to this day. These aspects are treated brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the One Man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing all his emotions in an absolutely brilliant way.
