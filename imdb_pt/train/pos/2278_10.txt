Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and will see this, I was expecting a big disappointment. Instead, I got a movie that perfectly portrays irony, humor, elation and, above all, the overwhelming sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> Surely this is Nolte's best performance to date. He captures the defeat and self-confidence of Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the tears retained behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is totally hilarious as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunting his detachment from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is discreet and more than effective as "Blue Fairy Godmother" of Cambell. <br /> <br /> This Pinnocioesque story of Cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unintentionally becoming his ideal tragic villain is a mature and vivid look at what we are as people. And besides, it's one of the most deeply romantic movies I've ever seen. Cambell is the incarnation of foolish and wise love. And in the movies, a painfully painful conclusion, he finally discovers what it means to be a real boy, while his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish. And he realizes that ... well, watch the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother night is undoubtedly in my mind one of the best movies ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that deepens our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
