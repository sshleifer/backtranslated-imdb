I consider myself a great fan of movies. I was sick on the couch and appeared in this movie. From the opening to the end I watched with admiration to these great actors, I had never seen, say good words. The filming was beautiful. That's exactly what I needed. I hope this message is heard about any bad comments written by other people. The director has a heart and beats with his actors everywhere. Thanks for making a movie like this. Just wonderfully awkward, beautiful gentle characters who are flawed and graceful all at once. Great. I can not send this without 10 lines in total, so I'll simply say I want more from this director, more of all the actors in this movie and more from the writer. I did not want it to end. The end
