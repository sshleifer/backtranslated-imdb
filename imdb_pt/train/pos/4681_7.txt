Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to indie movie lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and that of Nichols Closer. One scene especially where the character of Adrian Grenier is questioning Rosario Dawson about his sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen's character is questioning Julia Roberts, although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in "Love ". Note also that "Anna" is the name of the character of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and supposedly this movie is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen", so I'm not sure how that connection formed. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
