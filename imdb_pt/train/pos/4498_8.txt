Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so this is not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well represented by all. Even a few moments of 'laughter' mixed with some rather serious remarks about fidelity, age bias, and parental / Alzheimer's aging problems. <br /> <br /> The peculiar guitar music also contributed to the story. <Although I have been a fan of Mrs Annis since 'Lillie' (in the 1970s) and Mr Kitchen since 'The Buccaneers' and' Enchanted April ', I have only recently discovered Mr Green (' Me and Mrs Jones ',' Touching Evil, 'etc.), asking me the question - why had not I seen' reckless' until recently? !! Admittedly more of a 'girl movie' than something a man will sit, it is perfect for the lazy view of a rainy afternoon.
