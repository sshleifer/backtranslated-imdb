I've never watched this show before, although it has been highly recommended by members of my family. Curiously, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the filming location) and she pointed out some landmarks when I first visited. <br /> <br /> That interested me, so I bought the first grade on video and sat down to watch. In addition to recognizing some of the sites, I did not feel a bit surprised. Once again the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. The TLOG is easily ranked with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I am addicted to the program now. The characters are superb and show an unusual depth, keeping a frighteningly realistic edge. The appearance of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (no disrespect to Hadfield I found a very warm and welcoming place). <br /> <br /> I just hope he continues originality throughout his race (which based on the 2nd series that completed his reprise in the UK last night, it certainly is). <br /> <br /> Well done the BBC!
