I found this very moving when Spike and Heaton stayed together throughout the movie not to say that there are some treacheries along the way. I thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was in the foreground, I think. I had guessed that there were such gay intentions on Heaton's part. My favorite scene had to be the part where Heaton and Spike were trapped in the swamp and Spike flees. I usually thought Spike would not come back. I have to say that if it were not our film studies teacher making us watch this I would probably never have seen it. Overall I thought this movie was very good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British films.
