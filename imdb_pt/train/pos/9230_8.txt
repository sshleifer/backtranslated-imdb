There is so much that can be said about this movie. It's not your typical nunsploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost incidental to the story. <br /> <br /> It is set in fifteenth-century Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians takes up much of the film. It was interesting when everyone was fleeing from the Muslim hordes that the Superior asked, "Why are you afraid of Muslims, they will not do anything that Christians did to you?" Of course, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent for challenging her father. In the process, she witnesses and supports many things: the castration of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new Duke, the torture of a nun who was defeated during a visit to the Tarantula Sect, and a beating when she fled with a Jewish. The torture was particularly horrible with hot wax being poured over the nun and her nipples cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia is bound to continue having problems in questioning the male-dominated society in which she lives. . She even asks Jesus, because the father, the son and the holy spirit are all men. <br /> <br /> Eventually, she joins the leader of the Muslims as her lover and they dismiss the convent. Here is where you see more meat than you can enjoy at one go. But the tragedy is coming. She is able to take revenge on all wishes, including the duke and her father, but finds that the Muslim lover treats her in exactly the same way. She's a woman and that's all there is to her. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the saints of the church did to this heretic at the end, but it is prior to the torture of Saw or Hostel. for decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be pleased with the treats, but movie lovers will find a lot of meat to digest.
