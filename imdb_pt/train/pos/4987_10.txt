While I enjoy the books of EE "Doc" Smith and David A. Kyles by Lensman, the anime, which is based on the books, is a fair fun and innovative. Although the story may seem familiar to science fiction / fantasy aficionados, as some boys on an isolated planet inherit mystical powers and avenge the death of their family, but it's a lot of fun. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film to use cartoons and CG animations in one go. Sure, it may seem a bit outdated now, but it's still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, none of this would have happened (personally, I think Computer Graphics looks better in animation than live action). <br /> <br /> Pity they only released on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the worls (mostly in formats that are quite strange and different). I just wanted them to release the Lensman movie and TV series on DVD / VCD in ALL parts of the world, not just certain parts. <br /> <br /> Q. Worsel Rules! I just think he's so amazing and handsome too.
