I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are great. Ruby in Paradise is one of her best. It's a very understated movie that you really have to watch by to enjoy it. A story of a woman trying to survive by herself and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easier. Some of his films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time To Kill, probably fared better at the box office and video locations. They were very good movies <br /> <br /> too, but take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you'll agree that she's one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
