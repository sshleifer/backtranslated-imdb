Officeat, slow-paced, fun erotic thriller with lots of graphic scenes and "blasphemers" that undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult for them not to appreciate the various creative sequences that this film contains, or to ignore Krabbe's top-quality performance. Verhoeven retains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the visions-omens of the hero. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur, and the unsatisfactory ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
