I saw this movie criticized with the statement: "If you can overcome moralism ..." That's no longer the point. Morality is in the consciousness of the observer, so to speak. This is a decent movie with a murder mystery pattern, but with a distinct twist that pops up halfway. The resolution leaves the viewer wondering, "What would I have done in that position?" And I have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended. To this end, and to the end of entertaining the audience, the film is successful. I also like the way violence is never on stage, but just off the camera. We know what has just happened; simply is not served in front of us, then rubbed in our faces, as would be today with contemporary blood and dressing in blood. Moreover, violence is not the point. The point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, who is intelligent, albeit disturbingly, resolved.
