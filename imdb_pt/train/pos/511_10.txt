I watch this movie for the first time almost 21 years ago, when it was an ITV (before the days of cable and satellite) Matin√©e. I was out of school with the mumps and I was totally involved in the movie. I've had this in video purchased for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my all time favorite actor and I think it's a scam he ended up looked at so many times when the Oscar came around. I also think the Queen should have ridden him as he easily did for the film industry, if not more so than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film changes from black and white to colorful and vice versa is well done and the film has star actors like Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance by Richard Attenborough.
