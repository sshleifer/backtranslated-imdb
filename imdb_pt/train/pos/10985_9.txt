I was speechless and devastated after my first performance - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - no documentary, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville raffles. I continued to focus on how these women (who are clinically far beyond the eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising way, and wonder if their withdrawal from the world was motivated by something beyond the clogging of life in unreal blue blood. universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a trait of rebellion and rebellion that went out of his control and took on a life of its own. This may be one of the greatest films ever to come dangerously close to the farm, without going overboard - as the Edies do their thing, I notice things like the empty gin bottles in the room full of debris, urinating in bed, raccoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene looked incredibly sad - like a birthday party for a child who was seriously wrong. Very definitely worth seeing and looking at - you'll never forget, but very worrying.
