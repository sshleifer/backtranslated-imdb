This movie is as good as hard to find. The film's hero (and writer and director) is Simon Geist - a man "with an agenda". He creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to interview the Los Angeles pig - the actors, the models, the musicians - who believe that his own defecation does not smell. With intelligent dialogue, Zucovic can do that. Of course, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works great. Anyone who can re-enact 'The Scream' by Edward Munk in the reflection of a silver bin at a local cafe should be nominated for some type of prize. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they've been doing the same car since 1986 ... it's called 'the car'. Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
