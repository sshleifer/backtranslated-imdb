FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> You should not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an unending sequence of unbelievable feats, being stepped on in the process, but recovering at the speed of light, and transforming innocuous devices in lethal weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin is driving. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has countless features: breathtakingly beautifully photographed scenery, stunning visual and special effects (the first five minutes are thrilling and tone the movie), excellent music trail, lightweight welcome attempts to relieve some of the tension and solid cast: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker more than holds), a charming heroine (Janine Turner), and one of the most villains gang (invaluable John Lithgow and deceptively feminine Caroline Goodall but also Rex Linn - in a longer part than usual and who does more of the same, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good, solid entertainment then if not credibility. Like Roger Ebert "It's the kind of movie you can sit and enjoy as long as you do not make the mistake of thinking too much." <br /> <br />
