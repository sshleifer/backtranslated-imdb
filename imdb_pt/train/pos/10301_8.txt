Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best photos since ... well ... a long time ago. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen a long time too ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even makes some jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene is where Jim is disturbing the voice of the anchorman. My rating: 8/10
