The 1986 TV movie The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. However, the creator of Spirit, Will Eisner, did not like the film and, therefore, no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit (sorry) of the comics with a modern twist. I'm sorry, it did not materialize in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect spirit. Nana Visitor was a good Ellen Dolan and of course later would go to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of the big-screen version of Frank Miller, The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare history of the Spirit's story. It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie from an established character or idea, someone will inevitably look for previous versions of the property and cast it on video to make a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas wore the Zorro mask, we were able to obtain previous versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as Alain Delon's great 1970s version (though all the copies I've ever seen were poorly edited). Heres hoping someone will release The Spirit's TV adventure on DVD soon.
