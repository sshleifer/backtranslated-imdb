I do not agree with Anyone who did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie when I was little and still do. It's sweet, funny and warms your heart. And this proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although it did not have much history, it was still excellent. I give you a 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and that proves that your deepest desires and dreams can come true. (Rip, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally, if someone says it sucks I'll say "What a shame". Because it was a delightful little movie and I'm glad that at least some people liked it.
