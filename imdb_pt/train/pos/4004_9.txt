'The Mother' is that extraordinary piece of footage - makes you think, does not punch - and finally leaves you thinking. Very open to the fate of the main character. Anne Reid (who I only knew briefly from her appearances on some projects led by Victoria Wood and thought she was a good comedian) is really great here. Not the stereotypical widowed housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood. And not all that free and adventurous spirit in the beginning. She interprets your character only with the right note that sounds true (well, it did to me). Powerful cast. Great script. Revival of European cinema, indeed;)
