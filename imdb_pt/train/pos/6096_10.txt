I know technically this is not the greatest TV show of all time, I mean it was filmed on video and its limitations show both the visual and the audio aspect of it. The acting may also be a little crumby.but I love it show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it aired for the first time in 1988. of course I would have been 5 years old.But recently I bought the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear now is deleted. And I also heard Warner will not release more due to bad sales of the first DVD. Also the TV show does not have the same feel as the movies, actually I thought had a more sinister tone. Although the color palette is similar to the nightmare on Elm Street 4 (as much the film as the TV show was made in the same year), this takes a more serious tone as the movies have become each more sarcastic and playful. not a bad thing, I like Freddy as the wise clown cracker.but I think it was the strength of this TV show, you do not have freddy appearing every min utes cracking a joke before and after killing someone.In fact this has more of a dreamy feeling for it, reinforced by the soft focus of the lens.im not sure if it is deliberate on the part of the creators of shows or just for the limitations of being filmed on video. I love this show, and taken not as a follow up piece to the movies can be very enjoyable. Much better than anything on TV today.
