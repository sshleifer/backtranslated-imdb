this movie needs to be seen. the truest picture of what's going on in the world I've seen since Darwin's nightmare. Go and see! and if you are lucky enough to have it open in your city, make sure you see it on the big screen instead of on the DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for ideas to pass, though hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is also good. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this movie and, I believe, he had to use some of his own money to do it. It's a wild and absurd ride, obviously made without the resources I needed, but it's still successful. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL and even Bill Maher did not show the courage to say what this movie says.
