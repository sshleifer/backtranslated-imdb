In my opinion, this continues to be one of the best representations of Superman on TV, as well as one of the most faithful to a period of comics in particular. <br /> <br /> This series honored both the Superman films of the series. '70s /' 80s and the 1986 Superman comic series "reboot" ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics", "Superman Adventures"). The opening score and titles were hectic, based on John Williams' score of the movies, upgraded to a series of action on Saturday morning. Marv Wolfman, a leading contributor to the comic book reboot ("Adventures of Superman" writer) was a perfect choice to get involved in this animated series. Overall, the series had a more mature feel, continuing to be very friendly to children. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as believable, strong and iconic. His recurring rival was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation. The Daily Planet characters, Lois, Jimmy and Perry, were portrayed well. One of my favorite appearances was Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around his home island of Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her project and her mother's, Hippolyte, were in line with the Wonder Woman series of the same era, and it seemed that an equally well-made animated series might have been developed for her if treated in the same way. <BR> The only thing that is hard to believe is that this was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
