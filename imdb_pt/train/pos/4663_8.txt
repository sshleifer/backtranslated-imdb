I saw the movie's description in TCM and just let it roll because I like Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith so much, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it to be exceptional. Of course, it is seriously dated, but as a play of the period, it is worth noting just the subtle humor in the perception of life and the lifestyle, almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often. I was also very impressed with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as protagonists, and of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
