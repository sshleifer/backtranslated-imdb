"Inspirational" tales about the "triumph of the human spirit" are often great deviations for me. The most amazing thing about men of honor is how much I enjoyed it in spite of myself. The film is as predictable and clich√© as it seems, but it works. A lot of credit goes into the exciting performances of both leads. It's a perfect role for Cuba Gooding Jr., which is wonderfully contained here. We expect a lot from De Niro, and he does not disappoint. It creates a darkly funny portrait. Director George Tillman Jr. started making an old-style movie and came up with a winner.
