Pinning for Mr dwivedi is an incredible movie. It's definitely the finest and best of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. She's like you've never seen her before. performance. along with her is a good actor Manoj bajpai, who showed bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in Pre-partition pakistan. she is from a Punjabi family living in a small town. She is abducted by a Muslim man as part of a mid-life struggle with the Punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns, since marriage arranged from urmila is expected in a few days. this movie is really a very good movie. the plot is solid with an incredible script. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (you will not believe, but she can also act in addition to jus dancin in Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and more. the sets with pakistan pre-partition, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score increase the positives. from the beginning to the end you are stuck to your seat with the question that comes next? This movie is not to be seen, but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the final scene is the end of the movie. I would like to suggest to all those who do not amuse themselves with the kabhi-kushi-kabi-gum-and-no-dil-a-pagal-hai to watch this amazing movie. my rating: 10/10.
