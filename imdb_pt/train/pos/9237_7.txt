This movie is very good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original movie. I saw the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space". The same as they did with the first film, but with other episodes. But still, it's a very good movie. Just the ending is weird (you do not see what happens with Pegasus). But I still think it's very good. The actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen it yet, go see. Starring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
