This movie was quite a surprise. I was not expecting much, to be honest. The first Greta Garbo movie in Hollywood? And? Probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated contortions of arms and facial contortions that silent films of low degree show so often. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo must have shocked the studio people as much as she did, because that movie made her a star, and deservedly so. She instinctively understood the power of just standing still, or simply keeping a meaningful expression for a long, persistent moment, so that its effect could be felt and not just seen. I kept thinking to myself, how did this modern actress get into a silent movie? She was only years and years ahead of her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it is the usual tale of love found and lost. It's just Garbo's performance as Leonora, the poor village girl who succeeds in the big city and then returns to pick up the man who ran away, who gives him life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is helpful, but his character is never really developed and he is degraded by the script all over. At one point, he is forced to wear Garbo's clothes, get angry, then ignominiously return and return them. And let's not talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo and then with his wife. Very common, he did not have much career after that and I can understand why. But he is the somewhat mystifying object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There's a totally fantastic line in this movie that says it all. "Leonora, you're becoming remarkable." Yes, of course. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's all about without watching the whole movie, just watch the last 30 seconds - Garbo's gaze as she sits alone in her luxurious car says it all. "She must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says all about it. I have to see this again, Garbo is incredible.
