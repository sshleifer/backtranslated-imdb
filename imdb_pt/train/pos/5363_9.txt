This is a classic 1980s action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state, where the government controls everything, including the television networks. One of his most popular TV shows is "The Running Man," in which convicted criminals are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions of people. It is created as a game show where the public votes on their favorite stalkers, trained killers who hunt and kill the unlucky "competitors" of the show. Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson whose experience in gambling makes him well suited to this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of Arnold type classics like the famous "I'll be back" just before he gets into the arena. And he insults a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "How about a light?" I could go on and on, but I do not want to ruin the movie. It is funny! <br /> <br /> Whether it was planned or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "Reality TV" craze. There are already countless programs that show people suffering pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even lawsuits are televised for their "entertainment value." Running Man demonstrates what would happen if the reality show reached the bottom of the pit, and it's a scary picture. We can only hope that networks have the good sense not to allow this to happen. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
