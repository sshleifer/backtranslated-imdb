I'm 14 and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Don Deluise make a great pair. This movie is very funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are "You can not keep a good dog down" and this song about sharing, I think it's called "What's mine is yours." This was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find Itchy's voice so fun to hear. Despite some scenes that I found scary, I still have difficulty watching the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares me. Other characters like King Gator I found very funny. The ending was lovely and it was really sad, it made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
