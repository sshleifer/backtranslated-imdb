this movie is good if you like irrational action, tacky acting and a very small plot! The special effects are decent considering that this movie is from the director of the "Event Horizon". The costumes are like something from a Mad Max movie. None of the soldiers speak, so others tell them what to do. Eventually, it ends up as a great shoot'em up movie with explosions all over the place. I personally liked Russell better in "tango and money" "la escape / new york" and "executive decision". Must see this movie leave your mind on the door for a non-brainer science fiction movie !!
