This is one of the best movies I've seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's great as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is superb as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is hysterical as Miss Bates. And check out the handsome Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Anyone who has said that you need sex and violence in a movie to get along has never seen Emma. I think that's what separates you from so many others - it's elegant. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, or looking for a novel for yourself, look no further. Emma is this movie. With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes and an excellent cast (did I mention the handsome Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
