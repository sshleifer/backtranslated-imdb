Like other people who commented on "Fr√§ulein Doktor" I stumbled upon this little gem on late night TV without having heard of it before. The strange mixture of a police fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine, on the one hand, and a realistic, well-researched picture of trench warfare, on the other hand, caught me from the start. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the five best films about World War I (the others are "All the Silent On the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", "Gallipoli" and post- et rien d'autre ")). And the scene with the poison gas attack is really creepy; horses and men appear as knights of the apocalypse with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I just wish I had recorded the movie.
