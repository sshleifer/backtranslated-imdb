I'd say even a few shades of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most of Woody's fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was conceived as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody regains some relevance in the comedy film with this one. The plot curves are nice and tight. I'll say that in the first 20 minutes, some of the actors are a bit rushed in showing their lines, but they stay around. Scarlett Johansson proves well in the role of Diane Keaton, and at no time there are uncomfortable moments between her and Woody, who is much older. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
