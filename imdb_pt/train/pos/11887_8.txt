It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The projected toll is higher in Sub-Saharan Africa, where an additional 55 million deaths can be expected. In addition to grim statistics, there are personal stories we've rarely heard of. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most touching of Close to Leo, a film produced for French television as part of a series dealing with problems faced by young people. Although fictitious, it deals with a situation that is unfortunately very common - the effect of an HIV diagnosis on a close loving family. <br /> <br /> When twenty-one-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has AIDS, the family is devastated. Concerned about their youth, they decide to withhold information from their younger brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he hears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo says he's sick and Marcel is sad but accepting. When he brings Marcel to meet some former gay friends, the tension between them comes to the surface, setting the stage for a thought-provoking conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between siblings, I feel that Close to Leo's sincerity and the brilliant interpretations of Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales in their favor. Watching the events unfold from the young boy's point of view gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebec movie, Leolo and Truffaut, The 400 Blows. Unlike some American films that dance around the anguish of AIDS, Close to Leo tells a harsh truth, but does so in a way that is tenderly and wonderfully real.
