This electrifying musical has more than a touch of selfishness from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The movie has 90 minutes or more of pose, but it's actually easy to understand why it's a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Like other films that focus on the young musician trying to be great, there's a hint of drama to add a dimension to the musical numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, this is fun and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of things, the story revolves around Kid (Prince), a young artist and regular club goer. The club owner is frustrated with Kid's arrogance and the Kid little knows he could be fired soon and replaced by a rival. One side that the boy's parents are having trouble with, the father abusing her violently. During the course of the movie, the Kid learns some lessons from life and learns to like his friends more. That's all we've seen in adult dramas, of course, but this is combined as a musical, a very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. Prince is actually very good on the side of the drama when he is not doing a pose. He looks human and relatable. Clarence Williams is very good as the abusive parent too. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film, however, is the excellent soundtrack. The musical numbers are very staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical conductor, though very eccentric. When he is inspired, he is great but on the other hand he often makes songs that are exclusively for his own taste, and occasionally his experimentation may fail, but that is the same for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack to this movie is great, with only Sexshooter being a weak spot. The purple rain stop performance is the highlight though. It's one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
