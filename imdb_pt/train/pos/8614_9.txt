The film kept my interest mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts, claiming that the plot was not complicated. I had no problem following him (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The film was very sad and touching too. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a talented new talent (handsome too) and Tom Everett Scott does a great job with his part as well. The relationship of the mother and the daughter may have been a little unreal, but the behavior of the young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad, but enlightening. Surely won the other shows that were on New Year's Eve night
