Eric Valette is obviously a talented filmmaker, as are the two guys who wrote the screenplay. So Mal√©fique is a great movie, made with only a few dollars, but also tons of imagination. Well, I'm a bit exaggerated, but I'm still sincere. So, if you like dark and bloody movies, go and see this. Worth it.
