When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being dragged out of her tent by a dingo and then begins a ordeal that no one should have to try. For it seems that the history of the dingo is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a circus. Lindy does not help, because she will not play on the jury or court, she's just herself, and she's a madwoman difficult to understand, so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there is evidence that has not come light. Sam Neill excels as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It's good (or bad) to see that people are as prejudiced and stupid in other places as in the US too, because the Australian public does not believe in history and the media only stir up the flames. Eventually Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard work, but years later, a missing piece of evidence appears and she is released, but not until the family life is basically ruined. A heart-cutting story, very well made, a little long, but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
