I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to keep pre-revolutionary Cuba from being as corrupt as it was. Just reciting some statistics will not achieve with the younger audience. Still, the first part, which is almost entirely filmed in the jungle, captures the feel of that place, especially as it traverses the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. Of course Soderbergh does not despise these people, but it is also clear that he will not appeal to his case of 'Yankees' too far from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I read. To my knowledge, Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to obtain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But in other respects, he is right, especially regarding the sacking by expats as the island was another rebel control. The country's treasury was empty.
