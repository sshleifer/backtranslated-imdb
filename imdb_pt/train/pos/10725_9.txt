Space Camp is a decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released about the time of the space shuttle disaster, and this really set a stumbling block. about how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the space shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, this is ... on TV ... it seems normal. I remember this scene in the theater. This made you feel like you were really up there. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie to watch on IMAX, but I'm sure that will never happen.
