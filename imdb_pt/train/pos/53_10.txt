Home Room really surprised me. Compared to other films that have been written about Columbine high school this is the best. The living room of the house does not show the school shooting, but rather the consequences and effects of the community and the city. The film's focus on two opposing characters, Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who witnessed the whole shooting. She seems to show no emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna in the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile, police are investigating Alecia, how could she know that the shooting would happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along at first. Eventually, they develop a mutual understanding and become friends. (much in the style of the breakfast club). Home Room Beautifully shows the power of proximity and turmoil after a school shootout. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
