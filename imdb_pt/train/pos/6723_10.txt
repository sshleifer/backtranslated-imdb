Riding Giants is an incredible movie. This really shows how these people lived at that time just to surf. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing and having fun. They did not care about money, jobs, girls or anything. To them, the waves were their girls. I've never been on a surfboard, and it seems so difficult, I do not understand how they can stay in them, it makes no sense at all. This is an amazing movie and if you like surfing then you should really see this movie. If you're a surfer and want to find out who started surfing, how it came about, who's really famous at it or whatever, then you really should see it. It may be a documentary, but it's very good. -Tara F.-
