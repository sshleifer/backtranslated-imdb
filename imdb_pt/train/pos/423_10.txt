I just read the plot summary and it's the worst I've ever read. Does not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the listing in "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a kid. My sister and I could not wait until every April, when we could see it on TV. It is one of the best movies about horses of the time. It's one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The novel is clean and captivating. The plot is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make movies like that anymore. Good acting and not over. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best along with many other great actors.
