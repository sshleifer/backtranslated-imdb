A really sweet movie that bears some resemblance to the 2001 hit "My Sassy Girl," but it can charm most of the time. The biggest applause should go to the two leaders. Ha-Neul Kim is sweet and peculiar, Sang-woo Kwon is attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG inserts to spice up the visuals and also offers stunning fighting scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it much better here than in the highly overrated "Volcano High". And this kid has a future - those looks, these fighting techniques, and a romantic lead. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can summarize: cool movie. My rating: 7/10
