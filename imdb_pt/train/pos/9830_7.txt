No one really understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie movies, but ?? honestly ?? Why should we bother? All the movies in the "Zombie" series offer lots of fun, nasty problems and free shocks, and "Zombie 3" is no exception to this, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during filming. This film began as an interesting project Lucio Fulci, who had to elaborate more on his success "Zombi 2", but ended up being a typical product of Bruno Mattei, with more flaws and ideas stolen from previous films. The script is hopelessly ineffective and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea of ​​George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crazies" is brazenly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at. However, all this did not bother me for a moment, because the sublime exaggerated blood compensates for everything! On a secret army base in the Philippines, the scientists completed the "Death One" bacterial war virus and prepared it for transport. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, the infected body of a terrorist is cremated and the ashes of zombies contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors have to fight against hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies, as well as soldiers in white overalls who have been instructed to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City." Really Bad ... but incredibly fun with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative situations of zombie madness. The undead birds were original, for example, and the entire sequence of zombie births at the desert hospital was also pretty cool. The infamous flying head scene is not as horrible as it is meant to be and belongs perfectly in this tacky and thoroughly enjoyable Italian zombie movie. Recommended for fans; I do not mind the negative comments.
