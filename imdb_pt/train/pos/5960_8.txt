It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she can smile a lot. I also loved hearing her sing. Good change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The movie itself was fun, but seemed to skip some explanations in many parts. Several of the characters seemed to be miserable in one minute and happy in the other and it was left to their imagination to find out why. Each character was peculiar and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This movie was not full of clean, noisy people, but of complicated real people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them, and then find a way to solve them.
