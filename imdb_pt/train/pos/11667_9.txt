The Kells Secret is a movie I've been waiting for years after watching some filming at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to say now that it was worth the wait. The cartoons are very stylized, but not as annoying as I feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the lively illuminated book where the little figures come alive on the page. The characterization is superb, I love the voice of Brendan Gleeson as the stern Abbot and especially liked the voice of the Aisling sprite. The forest is a triumph, a place so beautiful. The story is well done, a mixture of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer to cheer for Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. I am a lover of calligraphy and lighting anyway, so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen this and are not fans of the craft agree it's a lovely little movie. I'll definitely buy the DVD when it's released, and I'd like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. There may be more. :) Coming back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and delivered them at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish you all the world's luck at the Oscars, such a joy to see this one named.
