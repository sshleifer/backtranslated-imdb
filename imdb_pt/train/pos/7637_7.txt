I really like this movie even though I do not really like James Belushi. In this movie, you can actually see several big names on the rise, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox are; Caine was already big, of course. The plot in this movie is simple; It's like that sliding door film. However, it was said in a cheerful way and I like the moments of comedy in it. It made me try to relive my own important moments live, for example, and if I took that girl to one movie, not the other, etc. It tells us that the people around us might have had different roles in our lives if minute details should change. It also reminds us to be careful about what we want. Life is not always as good on the other side as we think; perhaps, what we have now is the best for us, considering all things.
