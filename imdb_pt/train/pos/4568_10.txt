Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in a movie without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: the clich√© is true here: they do not play the roles, they dwell in them. Day-Lewis's performance is a tour de force - a transformation that is impressive, but it was truly a mark of Academy's intelligence that, along with this performance, they also honored the beautiful work of Brenda Fricker. like Christie's mother. By the way, if you have not seen this magnificent actress in "Swann", which is another film worth checking out for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
