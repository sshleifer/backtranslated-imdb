I saw this movie in the movies when it first came out a few years ago and I really liked it. But I still wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the movies that are coming out right now, and I'd say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!! ! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you do not have to waste any minute of this movie, if you do not completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good you can not wait. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
