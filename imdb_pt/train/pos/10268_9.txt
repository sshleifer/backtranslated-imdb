This typical Mamet movie offers a quiet, balanced view of what makes a confident man (Joe Mantegna) good. Exploited as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), he slowly pulls her into his world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The cast includes a number of players found in several Mamet movies (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie, and I often wondered why she did not become a more remarkable player than she became. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places! <br /> <br /> The film continues at a slow pace, with simple dialogues, but maintains a level of tension through which logically leads to the end of the crash. You would expect a real disappointment in the end, but I found this edifying and satisfying. I love this movie!
