After watching the movie last night, I was left with a sense of hopelessness faced by organizations trying to solve the problem the film portrays. The scale of prostitution seems so great that it is difficult to see how it can be defeated without major governmental changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the review. <br /> <br /> Although it is a dark movie with an uncomfortable central relationship, this is a very attractive film, and I would even say it was enjoyable. The film was well edited for the runtime and Thuy Nguyen's performance was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to have a little more insight into why Patrick thinks he has to help Holly, but maybe the reason is simple, as he explains to Chris Penn's character. I'm not going to explain it here - go see the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good, thought-provoking film, obviously with good intentions. I hope it gets released enough to reach a decent audience and gain more support for Project K-11.
