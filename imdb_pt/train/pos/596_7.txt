This made the television version of the legendary stand against desperate odds more objective, more realistic than the film versions of the events, although the film made after that went too far to humanize Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett . The focus here is on Jim Bowie, played with a cynical and sharp assignment by James Arness, who is apparently still alive at age 85. Then, at age 65, he returned to acting after years away from the screen. Raul Julia, who was born in Porto Riquenho, humanizes General Santa Ana as no one since the time of J. Carol Naish in 54. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as a lascivious popinjay - gaudier uniform, never seen before or since. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he hired, but, convinced of his own infallibility, he does not pay attention. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the actor whose age is appropriate for the character he plays: Col William Travis. Your portrait is serious. He is almost impressed with the older men who share the command with him. <br /> <br /> The only dissonant note was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a cat-skin cap and carrying Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he's been in another movie. Without any conviction in the portrait, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts neglected or suppressed in earlier versions of the film. We learned that Jim Bowie was, in the person of Santa Ana, fighting against his own brother-in-law. The Mexican soldiers performed poorly, in part because they were armed with rifles left from the Napoleonic Wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes a bargain." Bowie ironically explains. The entire defense project of the former Spanish fortress mission was militarily ill-advised - a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "The Alamo".
