Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least have had the chance to have its full sequence of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Since the American public (apparently) has the attention of a mosquito when it comes to humor that does not consist of desecration of diatribes, or has a concern with eschatological functions (sounds and smells), programs like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that, brilliant as it was, it was made for an audience that knew what to expect but was seen by an audience and boardrooms who had no idea what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show, even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and interactions between the creatures were rich in sub-context and there were other conversations just waiting to be seen beneath the surface. But, thanks to political correctness, such conversations happen only in my mind.
