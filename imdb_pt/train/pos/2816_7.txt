This is a Jackie Chan movie above average, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, but others then that is nothing special. All the characters are really cool, and the movie is fun, plus Jackie Chan is just amazing at it! Jackie and Chan Wai-Man had fantastic chemistry together, and both are very funny !, and I thought the main opponent looked really menacing !, however, the dubbing was just terrible! The character's development is above average for this kind of thing!, And the main fight is just fantastic! Plus some of the bumps that Jackie has on one of them are hard! There's a lot of silly and silly humor about it, but it amused me, and the ending is hilarious! In addition, all the characters are very friendly. It's very cheap but usually very well done, and although it does not have the amount of fighting you'd expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it's enough to keep you watching, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon ) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), are playing with a rifle and it goes off! This is a above average Jackie Chan movie due to the fantastic ending, and great humor, yet others that is nothing big, still worth the watch!. The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with a solid camera job, fantastic angles and keeping the movie at a brisk pace most of the time. The acting is very good!. Jackie Chan is incredible as always, and it's amazing here, he's extremely friendly, hilarious, as usual he does some crazy maneuvers, had fantastic chemistry with the Wai-Man Chan, kicked that ass and played that arrogant and wonderful character he was incredible! I just wanted them to stop dubbing him! (Jackie Rules !!!!!) Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he is also a good martial artist. Rest of the cast does it OK I guess. Overall well worth the clock!. *** of 5
