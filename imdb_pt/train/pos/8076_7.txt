Family is about two families who are after each other's blood. <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is an underworld don, operates from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once by mistake he kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and country). Arian (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother is out to get revenge for his brother's death. He kidnaps Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the movie belongs to him completely where, instead of his dialogues, the expression is more important. Akshay's tiny paper also placed him on the same level as Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were some loose spots in the script; to like; Amitabh was shown as the city's most wanted criminal still walks unpunished in the city. The kidnapping of his family also seems vague. How can the family of such a great gift have no security cover?
