This movie may be too bad, but it's a lot of fun. Bad performance and bad direction increase movie hysteria. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you enter this movie expecting the first Conan or Excalibur, then you will hate it. If you watch while you are in a good mood and accept this as good and stupid fun, you will have fun. Notice the scene in which they try to hang the brothers, their funniest scene in the movie. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have done it !!
