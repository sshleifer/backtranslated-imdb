I do not distribute ten ratings per star easily. A movie really has to impress me, and the Bourne Ultimatum went way beyond that. In addition, this trilogy has met so well, which I believe to be one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of our time. Although all three films could not be more different from Ludlum's novels, they still remain as a powerful landmark in filmmaking. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, but I could not even stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew we were about to ride. Paul Greengrass did it again. All we love from the previous Bourne films is here again: action, dialogue and, of course, the camera shaken. However, for me, the latter has never been a problem. I think this adds to the suspense. <br /> <br /> I will return to see this movie several times before being released on DVD, simply because it is great. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and must pass the test of time as a fantastic film and, in all, an unforgettable trilogy.
