Similar to "On the Town," this musical about landed sailors sets aside the later classic in terms of rhythm and quality of music, but has its own charms. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry, the cartoon of "Tom and Jerry" fame, one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where he is a determined Spanish lover reaching for his wife on a high balcony. Sinatra, playing Kelly's timid and inexperienced friend, and Grayson, the woman who serves as a loving interest to the two men, play most of the chant. Iturbi offers excellent piano reproduction. In almost two and a half hours, it's a bit too long for a lightweight musical, but it does not creep.
