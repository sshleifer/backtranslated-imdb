Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for the final! I've heard a lot of people complain about the way he filmed this movie, and some even likened the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? Come on, it was not so bad. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I prefer in highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I did not even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon was really comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes this can be a bad thing, but in this case it's a very good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this issue. Damon also has a large supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the CIA's secret organization. <br /> <br /> Although the film is full of great automobile pursuits and uninterrupted action, they have managed to keep a good amount of money. character development in your with all this happening. This film is way above the other two Bourne films, and is definitely one of the best films of the 2007 summer season!
