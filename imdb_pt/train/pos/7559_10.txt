This movie is so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is amazing, and Loren Dean plays an insane movie star very well. The plot is great too. It's all very real, which is scary. It says it's a drama, but this is one of the funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go take a look.
