A hot, sweet, and remarkably charming movie about two antagonistic workers at the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are carrying a novel via mailbox without any of them knowing about it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch maintains any abstruse sweet sentimentality and asks his actors to make discrete and uncomplicated presentations. As a result, you fall in love with just about every one of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong current of melancholy that runs through this film, which I enjoyed. Loneliness is an important theme, most obviously depicted in the character of the store owner and manager, interpreted wonderfully by Frank Morgan. He finds out that he is being betrayed by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to prevent him from feeling lonely when he does not have a partner to share it. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant because they are both reaching out to this other invisible, who each thinks like a soul mate before they even meet. Of course we know that everything will work out in the end, but the film does not let you forget the gloomy feeling that any of them would feel if they discovered that reality did not match the fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with a cast of crackerjack that has chemical boatloads. The small group of store employees refers to themselves throughout the film as a small family, and that's exactly how it seems to us. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and unsung novel. <br /> <br> Grade: A +
