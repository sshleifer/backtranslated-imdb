this movie is a very relaxed romantic comedy, which is very enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genial niece of Albert Einstein, although he believes in his own abilities. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she goes into her store with her fiance after her car fills. I loved Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This movie has a very relaxing feel, but still retains some kind of seriousness (if that's really possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> I personally found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the movie. Ancient scientists - I thought they were fabulous and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
