The events of September 11, 2001 do not need more human interest in how to follow the training of the beginning fireman or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to leave that aside. I think the directors tried a lot, maybe they thought the day's events needed a story as a backdrop. The comment from one of the cops - "this is not from Disneyworld" is appropriate. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a compelling vision for the representation of events. The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage of the day matches what they filmed.
