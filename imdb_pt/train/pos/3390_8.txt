Time is the future, and for many who do not know it, that day is now. In this final film by legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a classic landmark. Many moviegoers and environmentalists believe that this is our eventual story. The film is taken from the novel titled: "Create Space, Open Space", but whoever is working title has been changed to "Solent Green". The story concerns the Earth as it evolves into the future, with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing less than Catastrophic. The planet's natural resources have been depleted and staple foods have been reduced to simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now 'Solent Green'. However, there are those who know the 'real' ingredient in Solent Green and shrink with their own guilt and fear divine retribution. The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes to the top, it starts with Simonsons bodyguard Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and security chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson) targeting the Thorn for Waste Desposal Factory. Thorn's boss, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in his suspicions, but warns him of those "Higher and Hot" who want the case to be terminated, but Thorn will not risk his "Job" for an easy exit. What Thorn discovers the mark for death, but like the movie, awaits a final warning. ****
