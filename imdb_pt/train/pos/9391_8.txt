Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's scary and violent character and the oddity of JT Walsh. <br /> <br /> A wanderer is mistaken for a killer and tries to do a little. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage enters a trailer in Wyoming to do the drilling job with the help of his friend ... and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... arrogant, one step ahead, villainous, boisterous and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as a man with a bleak past, trying to live legitimately (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real-world characters of note here, with the exception of the disc. Vice Worker in the City of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turnaround arrives early on, and from there is a good neo-noir adventure in a sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts.
