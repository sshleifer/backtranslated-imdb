unlike the person listed above me, I felt this movie was really funny, particularly in scenes where there was a lot of confusion. I do not want to give the plot and the story to people who have not yet watched, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extensive role, like the previous Priyadarshan films, for example, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays an astonishing part in the small role he is given, John Abraham does equally well, Akshay Kumar proved that he is no less in this film as he had of Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaf. Even though all three heroines in this movie were in debut, they did a great job playing Nargis, who is very handsome and sexy. I would say if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a must watch.
