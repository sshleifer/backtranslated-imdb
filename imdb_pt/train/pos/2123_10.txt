Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and besides, I have a copy of this on DVD. There is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three fun and re-watchable. Also, has any other movie been remade three times with these star castles? Of course the main stars are great, but the supporting actors are also great. I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi. He was a scene thief that I sought to find other movies in which he is. It has appeared in many, but most is not available. Like the other reviews, I also say - buy this one.
