me and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good that we stuck with it all .. hahaha .. I think I'm addicted to the season !! ... they have some really good actors this thing .. the main trainer and the player who likes pete were very good and the plot already got me but I do not really understand how they will keep him stretched for a whole season. there will probably be some great cheer tho..I can not wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sumpter who is he? I can tell he will be great !! he was so good that we fell in love with his character immediately .. can not wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
