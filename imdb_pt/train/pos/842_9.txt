The Matador is a witty, dark and suspenseful melodrama that rises above mediocrity thanks to two very exciting and exciting performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and the ever-reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role here since playing gay neighbor Jack Nicholson in as good as that. A great advantage goes to writing as well. An intelligent and occasionally very unpleasant dialogue is delivered with enthusiasm by Brosnan, and the slow building of the friendship between these two different individuals is quite convincing to the end. The story takes some unexpected twists and makes the viewer constantly guess where the next one will be. <br /> <br /> The Director's nice artistic touches such as good use of music, smart editing, and unorthodox filmmaking sometimes set a good tone for the film and for a long time you do not knows how to label the film. But this is also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (myself anyway) at the edge of his seat.
