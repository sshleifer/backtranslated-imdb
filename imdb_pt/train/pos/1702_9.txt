If you have trouble dreaming, you can give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this movie was not meant to please everyone, just people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For these people, the movie is great! He plays old science fiction films and radio shows a long time ago, most of the wizards where they themselves have qualified. Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a bit to get the jokes, but it's worth it.
