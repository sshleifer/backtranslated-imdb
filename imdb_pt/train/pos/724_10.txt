The film is simply entertaining ... maybe more fun for those who were young and fans of "The Ramones" at the time the movie was made. I've watched the movie several times, alone and with friends, and it's still cool and funny. At the risk of being very serious, the concept of being a big fan of a particular band is timeless, and the high school students with the boring work of some classes are so timeless. <br /> <br /> And the movie has some gem lines / scenes ... references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us throughout our lives. (Let me assure you that I've been out of high school for, uhhh, a few years and you're not following me) ..... the famous line "static" ("I'm getting a little static" ..... "Not as much as you're going to get," as director Togar approaches) ... the school council member who is so decrepit that nurses attend him ... the Nazi Hall monitors worship a "body search" .. .... Director Togar announcing: "I'll give you the final solution," and recording the Ramones records (note: the records were before the CD) ... and of course Joey Ramone commenting, "Things have certainly changed since we were expelled from high school, "followed by Togar asking" Do your parents know you are Ramones? Just advice ... do not look for where stars are now ..... Joey Ramone unfortunately died young Dey Young, who was a hottie in the movie, today reminds us that we all get older ... PJ Soles career has never advanced as we might have expected .. ... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, Apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies on her every time we watch the movie), although I submit that her performance was more than adequate and should have brought him more roles in teenage cinema. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, watch and enjoy ..... do not think .... just enjoy yourself!
