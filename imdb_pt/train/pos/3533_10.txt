Unfortunately it is not yet available on DVD, but it is worth pursuing with TCM or VHS. One secretary believes that her boss was wrongly accused of murder and boldly assumes many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with lots of twists and dark alleys, none of which I'll mention! The sequel to the jazz band, where our heroine seeks information on the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite having a very low budget and made during World War II in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island seems a bit hilly - this is a film of original style and exceptional vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks, who knew a lot about these subjects, casting the bravest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall and Ann Sheridan - of that time. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - that the emigrants moved to Hollywood and brought with them a new and original vision. Regrettably, Ella Raines never received such a large part, and ended up going into poorly produced westerns.
