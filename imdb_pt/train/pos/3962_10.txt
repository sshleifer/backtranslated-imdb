Wonderful James Stewart, vehicle of Vera Miles. What makes this historic movie deal with the FBI so good is the family element that is involved during a 35-year career as portrayed by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows a history of the great research agency. He deals with plane conspiracies, killing Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gains, fighting organized crime, Nazis and Communists in that order. The human element is never far behind when Stewart marries Vera Miles. They raise three children, while Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart goes on a mission. <br /> <br /> Look for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly took the FBI to the point. <br /> <br /> True, this can be seen as right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's real republican views, but it's well done, historically informative, and the view of the family so well portrayed.
