I got this, one of my all time favorite movies on DVD recently and, as usual, during the show, the whole thing surprised me. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this movie leaves me in tears, especially the track "Will You." It is a pure nostalgic journey for me back to my youth. This rate is the second best for Quadrophenia (which was also starring Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcher years of the dark 80s I grew up in. The ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the movie I'm like a baby crying. <br /> <br /> I hope to use this DVD of repeated visualizations, I can watch several times and never get bored, simply by the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, I'm sorry to hear about your dear father. God bless you all. xx
