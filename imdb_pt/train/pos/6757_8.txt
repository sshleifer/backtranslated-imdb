Dana Andrews is "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in this 1950 film that also stars Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays the New York City sergeant. Mark Dixon, a sulky police officer who got into trouble in the past for beating suspects. When a man is murdered in a gambling club owned by a mafioso, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner will investigate. Scalise blames the murder of Ken Paine (Stevens), who now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but the victim. Dixon thinks the victim made a lot of money and was killed as a result by the mafioso's men. He will see Paine and, not realizing that he has a plate on the head of the war, throws him to the ground and inadvertently kills him. Now he must cover up the murder. As an additional complication, he falls in love with Morgan; Her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after he saw Paine hit his daughter, is arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is a great noir with great performances. The rugged, worn-out Andrews is convincing as a tough but nervous detective who needs to stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The film reunites him with his fabulous "Laura" costar, Gene Tierney, and she looks adorable as a model with bad taste in men who are apparently accustomed to being beaten. Little does she know, she has another in her hands. Ken Tully does a great job as his father, who protests his innocence, despite some overwhelming evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well directed, fast and absorbing film is the ending. Pure Hollywood, and putting myself in Tierney's shoes, I doubt he would react in the same way. A short review for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as inspiring as "Laura", but few things in this world are. If you like movie noir, this is a must-see.
