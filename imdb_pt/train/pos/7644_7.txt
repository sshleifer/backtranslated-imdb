Jim Belushi is fantastic as the "Average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bar that not only listens to Belushi's "story," but has a "cure" for all Belushi's middle-class problems: a magic potion to spark an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. Flashbacks show a 15-year-old terribly embarrassed to cause the defeat of their High School Baseball Team Championship. Belushi continues with her "pitiful life," apparently happy, but always imagining "what if ..." For what seems to be several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, hugely successful, admired and hated by others in equal measure. <br /> <br /> This is not well "It's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar and very catchy. The "final" is predictable, but still satisfying. Stay tuned for a young Cortney Cox in part as "fatal attraction" - like another woman. A very nice movie!
