In fact, I'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. I saw this as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American university. But no one in the US has heard of this, which is a real shame! The dynamic between people is what makes it funny and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus ride - somewhere most of us have been !! But I've never had one like this !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in which they stop for the funeral. Then the man and the woman creep to make love in the forest, but all follow to watch without they know! Just as she raises her skirt and he walks her all the way - the finisher starts to hack and they realize that everyone is watching !! Talk about surprise! But ... you really have to feel for them even if it's funny! When you see the ending, it's kind of ironic that they had fun while they did it! Serbian humor is the best!
