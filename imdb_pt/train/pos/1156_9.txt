Years ago I followed soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie and I was very rewarded for finding it. It's a wonderful parody of soaps, jealousy, insecurities of ordinary actors, and all kinds of adorable excesses. But more than anything - an incredible cast and an incredible script. How did anyone get all these high-level actors to play in such a silly kind of movie? And how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines? I've never heard anyone talk about this movie or even admit I've heard of it, but it's wonderful and I highly recommend watching it. Sometimes I go to play while I clean, and I end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying the whole wonderful thing. Many congratulations to all who did this.
