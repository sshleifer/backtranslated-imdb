I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I liked it and still do it now. But what I realize now is that this is pretty "adult" for a movie with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds' voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from optimistic ("Let's Make Music Together") to downright emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot good, although it becomes a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in the animation. A movie worth a try.
