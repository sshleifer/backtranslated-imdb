I have to start by saying that it's been a long time since I've seen it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful joke that was clearly inspired by musical pairs / comedies of new or faded stars with prominent musical groups. The mysteries of Kay Kyser would set a good example. <br /> <br /> Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play a lot of music and are part of the action, doing a great job. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett, the rumor of a part that was offered to Lou Costello and therefore Abbott and Costello replacing the protagonists. I do not know if that was true. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice but important film to have both Spike Jones and his band in the film through history. We wish it was released, since I have not seen or heard of it in two decades. I hope you're not lost.
