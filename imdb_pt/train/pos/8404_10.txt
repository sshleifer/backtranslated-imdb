Simple but humorous drive-in movie about a simple but humorous school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings to get the vehicle of his dreams. Sharing and love together begin quickly with the girls Bobby chose at the local pizzeria, but he discovers that a lot of responsibility, danger and suffering comes with the possession of such a mechanical wonder. <br /> <br /> Van is my guilty pleasure. It captures the laid back humor of the 70s and has unintentional humor enough to put it in the "so bad it's good" category.
