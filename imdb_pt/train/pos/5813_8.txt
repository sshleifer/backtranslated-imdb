This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now, I like to enjoy my movies with the story and the dialogue, but every once in a while, something like Moonwalker shows up, and it's watchable, despite the numerous flaws. /> <br /> This movie is no more than a highly entertaining Michael Jackson ad. Beginning with a sick video for 'Man in the Mirror', a montage listing his achievements and small and blatant of his career, he goes through all the heights of his life, and then falls into a really fun segment that functions as a video of funny music for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following the adventures of MJ while he runs from stop-motion maniac fans, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. Stop motion is not as bad as some believe. It is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Next, we see the excellent video of "Leave Me Alone" and go straight to the main text. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is laughable. Very laughable. We see Michael leave a building and be shot by thousands of soldiers. Then we hit flashback, showing MJ and three kids stumbling in an underground lair. 'Mr. Big '(Joe Pesci) is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the drug-addicted world (no details mentioned) at a young age. MJ and the little girl with whom he is caught, then pursued ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the important part. We have two really cool sequences where MJ turns into a car, then a robot spacecraft thing and, of course, the incredible sequence of 'Smooth Criminal'. <br /> <br /> It's a movie like that, but it's fantastic for those who like MJ. It has most of its biggest hits, and a few cool little bits, and some really good special effects (the Robot / Spaceship sequence in particular) Worth it, especially seen as if you could get it for about a pound on ebay . It will keep kids quiet for a few hours, as will most of the 20 youngsters who were kids when it was first released.
