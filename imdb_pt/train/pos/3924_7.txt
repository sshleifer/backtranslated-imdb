This 1939 film by director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his essays (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental movie, reasonably well done, but it's hardly breathtaking. The cast of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake, for while the actor had the right qualities for the part, even with several inches of makeup and a fake nose, he is too handsome for Honest Abe, who was famously homemade. It's a good attempt by Fonda, who is nothing if not sincere, but his miscast throw away the whole movie. The supporting cast is excellent, however, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is very reverent in his treatment of Lincoln, who is portrayed as a little shy of a saint, and in the final scene the film goes way beyond the top.
