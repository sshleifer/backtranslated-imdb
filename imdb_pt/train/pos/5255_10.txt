Tim Meadows has to be the most underrated of the SNL cast members. What initially was a low eyebrow look at a sleazy gigilo develops in a 90-minute run completely entertaining, albeit low-browed. Do not put this movie into the expectation of beautiful cinematography or Oscar-worthy performances. Walk there hoping for bright hopes with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best - making the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Man of the Ladies" Phelps is a na√Øve radio host who knows very little about anything except the ways of the wang. As a gifted Man of the Ladies, he wastes the wives of countless beatings who have gathered to hunt him. The director does an inspired work of guiding the actors in a comic encounter that completely composes the lack of development of the plot. How much plot would you expect from an SNL? While some scenes are a bit off the mark, for the most part, the linings of one of the Meadows and the absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone directly. For example, in one scene, Meadows compares to Mother Teresa, but for bonin '. Of course it's rude, but will we all, in the privacy of our homes, not laugh at his advice to a whole town for "doing it in the ass"? In another scene, immediately after a sincere kiss with the female protagonist, he suddenly remembers that his name would be benefactor, a woman with whom he slept years ago. He stands before the woman who obviously falls in love with him and proclaims that "The Ladies' Man is back," to his obvious disgust. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball out of the bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, the repressed homosexual, has solid performances. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you like adult humor. If not, stay away with extreme prejudice.
