Well, it's been a long year and I'm thinking of reviewing the last film of 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Called Rio) came second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it did not go so well at the box office, as it was too artistic for movie goers, especially since the MMFF is the season when so many families go out to see movies. <br /> <br /> Rather intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play on the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as star and director. His great vision and creativity helped this movie a lot. He was also very effective as the main star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that were necessary for the film. Also performing well was the young actress Rebecca Lusterio. She did a great job portraying Bikay, Duroy's younger sister. I hope to see her on many other film projects in the future, perhaps venturing into other genres. I think the fact that this movie was in your local dialect really helped. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera scenes in the movie were done very well. The scenery was breathtaking even though I thought a minor effort would seem completely different. <br /> <br /> In terms of the story, I think the writers could have plunged even more into the lives of the smaller characters in the movie. I certainly will not be enthusiastic about the history of this film.
