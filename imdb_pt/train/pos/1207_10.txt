I still love it 17 or more years after the first time I saw it, I actually discovered that I had lost my copy of it and was very upset. Although it is not an association with the original (which, as a child, I never noticed and, as an adult, I do not care), is how the drawings * should be. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents raised me about this kind of thing, instead of the drawings we see today that teach nothing to our children. The music is great, and gets stuck in your head forever ... I downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.
