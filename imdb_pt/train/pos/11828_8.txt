"Dick Tracy" is a favorite of our family - the actors are great - the art direction is exceptional - the music is magical. It's not to be "To Kill A Mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or Later" is right, "What you can lose" is haunted - even melodies such as "Live Alone and Like It "add to the story <br /> <br /> You have to love the dizzyingly over-the-top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan and Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains ... The list is too long. And yes, even Madonna and Warren Beatty are amazing. Written with a smile per minute (how many times did we look at each other and say, "Wait a minute - I'm having a thought - it's over!"). <br /> <br /> However, one of the most revealing things in this movie is that everyone involved seems to be having fun - and that, above all, increases the pleasure for the viewer. So if you have not done it yet, why not give Dick Tracy a try - take it as it is - a lively Sunday comic - and in a wonderful way!
