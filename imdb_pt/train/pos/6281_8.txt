I had the chance to watch several movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This movie remains its wonderful action and great story. Although if you are looking for a movie with a great picture, this is not it. Not having this DVD movie helped make the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting that do not always match. Overall, this is what makes this great movie fun to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu-ray movies, you get two things. An image that is almost crystal clear, without distortion or a film with a grainy HD image. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost started to think that this was a blu ray standard. Although after watching other movies I know better. I can not believe they spent as much time as they should have transferred this movie to HD. This is usually the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu-Ray players and Blue Ray Disc players, you should only have the best picture. So I consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have never seen the movie or have not bought the DVD version.
