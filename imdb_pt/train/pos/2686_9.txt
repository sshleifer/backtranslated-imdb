La Teta e la Luna is a symbolic film from Spain. Everything in this movie has a symbolic meaning. It's totally different from the usual movie you have access to. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but will only be good for people who want to seek the meaning of everything in the history of the film. I should advise that this is not a sample movie. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy!
