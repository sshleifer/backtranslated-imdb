Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all the techniques (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is fantastic as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He is acting as the legendary Outlaw and is well supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All the action sequences are at the point <br /> <br /> The movie is the part of your seat to the end. One of my favorite movies from the legend of the past Heath Ledger, which has been the highlight of all the films he has starred in. And make no mistake here. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie for all tastes.
