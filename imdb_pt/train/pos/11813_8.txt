Love or hate, it's hard not to find Warren Beatty in "Dick Tracy," the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous comic strip, no less than a classic genre. Superhero movies have been coming out of wood in recent years, and may soon become a genre by itself. <br /> <br /> Beatty's film generously uses Gould's original material, filming in all six bands. primary colors and thus give this unique and familiar world of mutant gangsters and loose and seductive women a lush visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the strong visual aesthetics of the film drastically shorten. change the characters and their acting skills, which I do not think can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" delights in his visual and fearsome characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the headstrong. and incorruptible title detective, is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at all costs. <br /> <br /> In addition to the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously exaggerated in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tr Em Tracy, a well-planned move , but also seeks to gain control of all criminal actions in the city, uniting all enemy gangs under him. Tracy, meanwhile, is juggling her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have, stays true to her side and takes care of The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a paternal figure to admire in our hero who destroys crimes. Tracy's loyalty to Tess is tested by the tempting breakthroughs of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also the arrogant major of Big Boy. At the same time that all this is happening, things heat up when a new criminal figure comes to town and decides to play both sides against the middle. <br /> <br /> Presentations are good, like Beatty's focus. in the tense and romantic relations between each of the bonds, becomes the center of the material, instead of focusing only on meaningless action and special effects. Pacino freely chews the stage in a role that really stands out from the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most neglected of the comic book genre. I think if Chester Gould were still alive he would be proud of Warren Beatty to have his beloved crime fighter. <br /> <br /> 8/10
