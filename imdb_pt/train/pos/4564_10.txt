If there has ever been an inspiring story that could lead anyone, incapable or not, to persevere despite adversity and do so (even when it "achieves" as an appropriate expression, it may have a broad bed that is ultimately a truth personal), MY LEFT FOOT is that. It's a difficult movie to watch at times: see the less placid aspects of Christy Brown's personality emerge in two main scenes - one when her sister states she is pregnant and about to get married while her father has a bad reaction and at dinner. table when the woman who reached out to him, made him able to communicate effectively, now announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art), she is about to marry another man - it is difficult. Very, very hard. Even more so because this is a man who can not react according to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows: through screams, shouts and profanities aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction, even when there is a bit of it providing the autobiographical description, but that of a man who overcomes his grave disability, becoming a functioning human being and a force to be recognized in the art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful and unforgettable performance as imperfect but tenacious Christy Brown and Brenda Fricker also for his supporting role as Brown's solid mother.
