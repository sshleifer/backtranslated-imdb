This movie is about a dysfunctional family, but not just about any dysfunctional family. It is the Family of the Father of our Nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son, Harilal Gandhi. It shows how the Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to approach, the Mahatma was among them. This is a beautifully made movie. Akshaye Khanna proved to be a Top Actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who plays mainly the lawyer of Plays-Gurukant Desai in Guru, portrayed Gandhi beautifully (as a true Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God) Shefali Shah, the girl from Monsoon Wedding, also did a great job job. to show how Kasturba Gandhi was divided between father and son. This film is touching and its soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" is sung in a very original way. I saw this movie only 3 hours ago (released in Dubai the day before - on day 2) and when the movie ended there was "Pin Drop Silence" and while leaving the Theater not one person pushed another (You can imagine us Indians not Are we pushing?) NOT ONE! There was a sacred silence ...
