I'm a very old guy, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coca-Cola like they were 50-55 years ago when every taste for a kid was new. I wish I had left it a little aside, so it's a hanging magical closet, so I can taste these things today. This magical closet may even have adjusted the fabric of food to explain how I evolved, physically or not, a kind of dynamic chemistry of expectations. Over the course of half a century, they would have to adjust a bit, because you know I would know that I set them aside. To eat it now would be a celebration of self and past, of history and meaning that would make the intervening years almost an early reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have the good sense to do this with the original Coca-Cola. And I could not have invented one of those magical psychic closets ?? not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I really tuned in with Roman Polanski. Was it a strange and exotic pleasure? you know, movies smuggled from the Soviet bloc. Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterwards. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women, one, and then decide that they would be the last ones to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and put it aside. I did not watch. I delayed until I thought it would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I tested myself, my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it. There are probably few Poles who have worked on it, practicing to deserve Chopin. Working to deserve femininity when I see her. Trying to draw the inners from the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I got something as a guarantee that it was time to do this. I already knew that it was past the time when this would work in the best way, because I had already seen and understood the "ninth Portal". <br /> <br /> If you do not know this, it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (about whom the story is called) jumped out the window, to die later after this man by Polanski) visits. What happens is that time doubles and he becomes that woman. We are deceived into believing he is simply crazy. But the way we follow him, he is not. He merely has flashes that the world is normal, and that the people around are not part of a clan that distorts his reality. <br /> <br /> History hardly matters. What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that consists only of confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can haunt me for the next 30 years. Is the idea about and in and out without borders? nothing except a red wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone who can do this, that sketch that remains a sketch, that horror that remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the genius of this, you have to know one of the greatest films ever made; "Rear window." The genius of this film is the post-noir notion that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out. In Rear Window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything else was fiction, fabric as we watched. Here, the apartment dweller on screen is the filmmaker. We know that. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change identity, that times change, that causality is plastic. We know the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us perpetually horrified, on that edge he imputes, but he never shows us and allows us to imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 4 out of 3: Every cineleted person should experience this.
