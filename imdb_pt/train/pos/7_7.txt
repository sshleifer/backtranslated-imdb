Although I did not like Stanley and Iris tremendously as a movie, I admired the performance. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role he plays is gold. He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene in which he has to take his father to a home for the elderly because he can no longer care for him and this will break his heart. I really would not recommend this movie as a great cinematic entertainment, but I'd say you will not see much of anything anywhere.
