"Moonstruck" is an adorable film directed by the excellent storyteller, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Violinist on the Roof, The Hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, has a touching romance and (best of all) it's a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked the most about the movie was the relative unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage seems positively odd to most of the movie, and Cher ... well, Cher always seems a little weird. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie and easy to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
