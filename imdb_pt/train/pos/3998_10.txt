Somehow, I missed this movie when it came out and I discovered it last week, thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I do not remember another intimate dramatic film, which does so many things so well. The writing is sharp, realistic, differentiated and even contained. Cinematography and editing are understated but inspired, allowing visual narrative to dominate through wonderful close-ups and framing of images, capturing the loneliness and alienation of the most memorable forms. The acting is also wonderful, with all the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most convincing ways a movie can deliver. They reveal their most intimate weaknesses with raw and unprotected vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, and the rest of the team. A must see for serious movie lovers.
