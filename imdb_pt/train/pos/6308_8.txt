Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of low people joins an "experienced" bandit to get out of poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the spoil factor. <br /> <br /> It's good to see George Clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change. The casting is perfect and the acting standards are very high. While it may be said that the subject of the heterogeneous team is not new, I think this film deals in an interesting and unique way. Sufficiently enough to stand out from what was before. <br /> <br /> Very well done staff.
