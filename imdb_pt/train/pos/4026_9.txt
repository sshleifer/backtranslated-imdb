Pinjar is truly a masterpiece .... It 'sa thought - provoking movie that makes you think and makes you question our culture. It is undoubtedly the best Hindi movie I have ever seen. This film should have been screened at film festivals around the world and I believe it would have been a serious candidate in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunting their roles. <br /> <br /> The story that the movie tells about the partition is a very important story that should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> It has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is represented as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, significant and haunting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the acting took my breath away. All were thrown perfectly.
