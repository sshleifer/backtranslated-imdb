This movie has several things to it. It's a "feel good" story. The characters and actors are friendly, realistic and show great performances. The most important thing, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good playing and hitting "The Natural" as well as Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In "Major League," Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that image was sheer nonsense - and not very funny. So many previous baseball movies, even where stories might be interesting, were so lacking in baseball skill on the part of the leaders, they were ridiculous about it. In "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command, "Jimmy Stewart looked as believable as a professional baseball player, as his overweight, non-athletic, elderly uncle at the softball game at the family reunion. Other physically robust and virile stars (eg Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball skill that would put them in the final rounds, "picking-up" for a game at the Sunday picnic (even if it is coed and even if your uncle was involved). The scenes of the Quaid high school team he trained, those in which he participates in the test with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and the American League, all sound true. Participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always offers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to some extent, some of his over-the-top scenes and his forced accent in his interpretation of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely on target here, and this movie is a "9", as good, or better, as any of that genre except "The Natural."
