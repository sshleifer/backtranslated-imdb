I think most people who have posted comments about this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have a bit of elegance. First, to evaluate a movie, you need to understand to what extent everything in the movie works together. Modern sensibilities require great drama. No, I do not mean a great scenario of characters and plots, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are largely tragic or very comical. This is a subtle movie. Its beauty lies in subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It's a beautifully filmed film that combines sensitivity, politics, human weakness, venality ... his name. The world you are in would be strange and not understood today ... a world where, if you have, you have to flaunt it NOW and HIGH, even if you only think you have it. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian as people understand that term today. <br /> <br /> This film helps to clarify things.
