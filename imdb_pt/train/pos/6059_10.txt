This is an excellent documentary, packed with racing action images and a great story. IMAX cameras offer a very wide perspective, as a DVD movie is perfect. You hear every speaker working almost all the time, the movie is not accelerated and only gives you the natural feel of 230 mph. Of course there are some sound effects added, but I think they are good, they give a depth to the directional scenes ...
