I had read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie. I am always intrigued by a history of hope and overcoming life-altering events, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> The backdrop of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the closeness of the family and how they positively affected the lives of others. I can not talk about the accuracy of specific details in this movie, it is customary to have some creative license when organizing a script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting movie from a story that must be told. I felt empathy for the characters and applauded in the end.
