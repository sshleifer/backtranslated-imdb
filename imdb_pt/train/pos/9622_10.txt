I watched this movie on Showtime. Quite a coincidence, actually. If I had not had only 6 hours of sleep the last two days, I would not have gotten home earlier from work. If I had not gotten home early from work, I would not have seen this movie. I would not know what I was missing, but I would have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> That's how the movie is. It's almost touching the effect of Kevin Bacon. This is causality (hence my wording above). The character of always is interconnected in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is simply wonderful. I'll have to find a copy to buy.
