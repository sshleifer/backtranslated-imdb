The title exaggerates the content of this film, which can lead to some unfulfilled expectations. Frankly speaking, there is very little "panic in the streets" to be seen here. In fact, throughout the film, very few people actually know that there is a loose killer who may be spreading the plague to anyone and everyone he encounters. That said, what we have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts reasonably loud anyway (because, unlike people "on the streets", the viewer knows what's going on) and that director Elia Kazan constructs very deliberately. When the plague-infected killer is sought, one of the most interesting sidebars I encountered was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, the two really do not like each other, although they have to work together. In the end, they forged a true bond of respect for each other. Kazan did a good job with that. <br /> <br /> Virtually all the presentations here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was very impressed with Jack Palance, who started playing what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Bel Geddes has become a little boring like Reed's wife, Nancy, but her role was not really central to the story. All in all, a great job. 9/10
