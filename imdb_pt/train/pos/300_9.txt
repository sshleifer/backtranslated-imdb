With several Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout the cast and crew "Everyone laughed" is much more a family affair. If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier photo, it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an auxiliary consideration. If all this sounds like smug self-satisfaction, you will be pleased to know that Mr. Bogdanovich navigates well from this particular danger and offers a sweet and quite innocent "I love NY" This is also an altar on which we can worship the ethereal beauty of deceased Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake, this is her photo. Mr. Gazzara admits this to her more discreetly in all his scenes together. The plot - a detective agency also engages personally in the affairs of its clients - is of minimal importance, it is the performance of the two clues that dominate the film. Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors, from "Targets" onwards. There is a glow about each of his films that only special artists can draw from an inanimate optical equipment. of this love. Extra insight into his work can be gleaned from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors, most notably "Who the hell in it?", Recently reminiscent of UK bookstores. The soundtrack for "They all laughed" ranges from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall show to Sinatra, from Country to Latin, as eclectic as the city it portrays. The image of "Garoto de Ouro" by mr. B would certainly stain, for that is the nature of the film, but it is equally certain that one day it will be restored, and when that day comes "Everyone laughed" will be recognized by the film. Good job, that is.
