Why am I so convinced that there is another film version of this novel somewhere? I saw the movie again this year while I'm teaching the novel and I find the changes in the movie annoying - there is no boy appearance in the novel and the ending has changed. They kill him in the movie, but the main point is that he is haunted by the events at Eel Marsh House for many years, but remarry and eventually put the events back. Bentley is a much nicer character in the novel, the scene in the movie that Kipps shoots in the office is sheer nonsense, and the toy soldier's constant appearance to signify the child's presence is genuinely scary but meaningless. Kipps is haunted by the woman in search of revenge, not by the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and really scarier. Did I just imagine that?
