I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4: 00 at my local store and I thought it looked pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was sure it was good. To begin with, this movie is about a snowman killer, so it's something to laugh at and the look looks funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The performance was good and the lines that Jack Frost said made me laugh, "I just killed you for a cigarette" and "Snowy Cone Worlds," how funny is the camp? The tale at first was very funny and silly also "Jack be agile, Jack be fast, Jack plucked out his eyes with candles". If you're looking for one for a horror Comedy B-Movie that is full of puns, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
