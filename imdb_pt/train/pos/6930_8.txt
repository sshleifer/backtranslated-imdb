This is an unusual and unique little western that is made mostly original due to its history that revolves around a single and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who manage to put it at one point or another in the film. <BR> <BR> It's mostly a very fun movie to watch, but not without being a real western as well. The film was made in a typical movie style of the 1940s and 1950s, so lovers of the genre should not be discouraged by its somewhat unusual main premise. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie, it allows the story to follow various characters throughout the film, who are all connected, of course, and the story makes a circle at the end. Without it, this movie would have been quite confusing to watch, since the story often jumps from one dangerous occasion to another, with constantly different characters involved. It's amazing how they managed to put Wyatt Earp into it all. But it's not really critical. I liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from one event to another. He gave the film a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is also a very beautiful film. I liked the settings that the film used and it seems quite surprising that this was actually director Anthony Mann's first western. Luckily he would drive more westerns later, which would also often star James Stewart in the lead lead. <br /> <br /> It was a very daring pitch choice to choose James Stewart as the main track. He is one of the most suave and educated actors in appearance and acting, so climbing him as a tough gunslinger seems like a rather odd choice. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and shows just how versatile and really capable as an actor he really was. <br /> <br /> He also has some other amazing actors in the movie, who do not usually connect with that genre. Shelley Winters plays the female lead and well-known actors such as Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in small roles. <br /> <br /> A true western with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
