The medieval German saga of Fritz Lang continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge his murdered husband, Siegfried. Your brother is too weak to bring the murderer, Hagen, to court. Kriemhild marries Etzel, the King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives birth to a child and invites her siblings to a party. Etzel and the other Huns must kill Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a huge life battle. and death begins, and it puts the whole place ablaze. Eventually, Hagen is dead, and Kriemhild is dead. These films deal with great themes such as revenge and eternal love. Certainly we have already seen some better movies made on these topics, but this was one of the first.
