The best martial arts film of all time. This movie is better than anything Bruce Lee has ever done. A classic with a completely entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of the martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu. It's a great pity that although Bruce Lee was so overrated, it took an eternity for Jackie Chan to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie orders !!!!
