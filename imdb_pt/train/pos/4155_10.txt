What an awesome episode for this series as well. This is the excellence of television at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully shot in black and white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and strong images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to ruin it. It is a rare performance of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. Taking such a delicate subject makes this episode even more impressive. Our emotions are as torn and confusing as the characters. The chills ran down my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan like a beautiful, "Oh, but I was a lot older than that now," as Byrds sang. This goes way beyond a 10 and all the way up to the stars. Beautiful.
