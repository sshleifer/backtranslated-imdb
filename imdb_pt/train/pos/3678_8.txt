It's a very good movie and I definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 negative points: - the level of the stories has a broad spectrum. some of the scenes are very big and some are boring. - many stories are not self-contained (if you compare with coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a phrase or how you want to call it), but most stories are very good, some are great and global is one of the best movies this year for sure! <br /> <br /> boring, I have to fill 10 lines at a minimum, I do not have to say anymore and I do not want to start analyzing the single sequences ... <br /> <br /> well, I think it is!
