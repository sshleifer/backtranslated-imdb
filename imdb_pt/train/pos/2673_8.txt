The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a journey that many nomadic and poor Turks do so they can live the good life in Switzerland. These people are as desperate to live as Westerners who will give up their lives and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are fooled by greedy con men who earn their living by charging huge fees for desperate people who are not in a win situation. A family faces the cold, treacherous ridge and predatory criminals only to find that there is not always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists all over the world, not just in America. Some people tend to forget that. A heart breaker from a movie that will leave you wondering why in the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
