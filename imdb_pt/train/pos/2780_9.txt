Great movie, "I loved. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. It captures the true feeling of indigenous life, but we can all relate. A well chose cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters so you really care about them all and feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great and the direction really works, as everyone seems real and natural. You can not help but cheer for Jess in this movie! The acting was very good, even the gait and body posture of both major ladies is very convincing as someone who played a lot of football.
