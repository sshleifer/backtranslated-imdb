A fantastic Arab adventure. An ex-king, Ahmad, and his best friend, thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus), seek out the love interest of Ahmad, who was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a moment down here. He is always inventing new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (there's no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the princess's father. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him by the hand of his daughter with a flying machine horse. That would probably count as one of the greatest children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated these days. The children will certainly mock the overlapping images when Abu and the genie are together on the screen. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially horrible. While most of the younger generation probably think King Kong looks bad right now, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a marionette on a string that does not even remotely resemble a spider. 8/10
