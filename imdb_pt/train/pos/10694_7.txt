I've had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this movie portrays what a lot of them are, alas. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, and highly unjust. From robotic sex, the search for gifts, to lies and betrayal, I experienced all this in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the pictures of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of photos of many hot Russian girls I've met, black comedies, scams that I was privy to the story of my appearance on Russian national TV. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You will love. I spent a lot of time putting things together. So check it out. The Russian woman Nicole Kidman plays is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photos. <br /> <br /> My 3 fiancee looking for travel in Russia is very exciting and would sell, so why not make a movie of my fiancee in search of adventures in Russia? However, there is a factual impossibility in this film, and this is how the guy orders his bride from a catalog and have her arrive at an airport. It does not work like that, so I do not understand why the media like to perpetuate it. There is no Russian bridal introductory site that works that way, and I challenge anyone to find one that does it. The fact is that you can only order the CONTACT INFO (email, address, telephone number, etc.) from the website of the Russian lady. From there, you match and then visit, and if you want to bring it to your country, you start the immigration process at your INS office, and wait months thereafter. This is how it works in real life. You can not simply order her to arrive at your airport. US Immigration would NEVER allow this to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> I got everything I wanted going abroad!
