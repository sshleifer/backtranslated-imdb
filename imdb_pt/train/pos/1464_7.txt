More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better as a header. The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you want) shows movies here his way. Most of them are classics, but they are all listed here on IMDb and I strongly advise you to watch them (especially the Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation & and Lynch movies) because Slavoj Zizek will reference them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, it can spoil them for you. I do not remember if it spoiled more than those I listed (I think Chaplin's films too), but as I wrote it would be best if you watch all of them beforehand! In the IMDb listing there is a missing movie, which I reported to them, so it can get there soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's only a short stretch, not a big deal anyway. <br /> <br /> The opinions and opinions of Zizek are crazy and fun to hear if you have an open mind to see things from another perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie a little for you ... this does not mean he'll do it, but could)!
