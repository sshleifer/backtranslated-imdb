This is a scary movie. More scary than anything, David Lynch, and this shows what a great director Polanski is, as this is not the kind of job ever, and it's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> It all starts with Trelkovski moving to a building in Paris. He soon discovers that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he believes that the rest of the people who live there took her there. He also believes that they are trying to do the same with him. The result is an amazing and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> All production has classic horror written everywhere: from images to music, the viewer can feel the terror of Trelkovski building itself. <br /> <br /> Are they all out to kill you? Or maybe just drive you crazy? Is there a difference? Discover for yourself. 10/10
