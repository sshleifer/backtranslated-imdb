Has anyone managed to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not Reel) who is seen flinging his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist when he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He's just onscreen for a few seconds, but my family would love to have the movie. He was killed in a duel over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Did we know the movie studio that did that? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen in a video store like Blockbuster? I would like them to make whole catalogs of these old movies, since it is so cheap to make DVDs nowadays. <br /> <br /> Please email me to nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
