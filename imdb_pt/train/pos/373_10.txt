this movie is an amazing and moving work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and not really much "get it" ... I saw it again when I was 20 years old (in video, of course, and now I own it) and was just surprised. Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful film that keeps you involved from beginning to end. I read the book too but there is something about the movie that really gives life to it. the cast, acting, music, costumes, scenery, everything, simply wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you vibrate ... it brings out all the imaginable emotions. is one of his best works and should not be forgotten!
