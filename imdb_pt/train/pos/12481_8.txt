Okay, so I do not watch many horror movies - and the reason is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I got this on a DVD (surprisingly full of features) and it scared me. In fact, the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I was telling someone about it when I realized that I had only seen 10% of it. The rest of the time I was watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would pick me up if I really covered my eyes. On the few times when I struggled to watch the screen, I jumped so hard that I decided not to look up again. <br /> <br /> The film production is solid and the situation of the characters was really convincing. The simplicity of the movie is what really captured my jumping button - it's just a forest, a cabin and an abandoned prison - and a lot of darkness. What struck me most was the fact that while this was clearly not a multimillion-dollar production, the makeup effects did indeed look like it! Also, it is obvious that this is a movie made by someone with a great love of cinema. The sound design and music really made use of my surround system as many Hollywood movies never did. I noticed online that this movie won the LA Shriekfest - a really important achievement, and I think the festival had seen the clear flair of the filmmakers - and probably a lot more of that movie than I got. <br /> <br /> Turn up the sound, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend - ask for a pizza.
