William Wyler should have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's stage play with the music / recruiting poster vivant, but his own military commitments interfered and went to an improbable helmsman: George Cukor. The "women's director" has a certain touch on the many documentary sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests that with a more shameless humanity than the generally allowed genre, particularly in wartime. Of course, the bunch of newbies (and totally white, saved by a Chinese-American recruit that has not been billed) is cooler and healthier than in real life, and the talk about home and mother and wife and boy It gets pretty thick, but it's propaganda efficiently and undeniably fluttering. Noteworthy also for the male cast, all military, several of whom have not resurfaced for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (as Andrews Sister teacher), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. And also by a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who does not appear until an hour and a half after the photo, but has good sequences like O'Brien's troubled Brooklyn wife. Too bad your rights are in a tangle and the only impression anyone knows is 16mm; of course, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (with considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm printout, it's probably somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It is insincere and tacky in points, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and deserves to be seen more widely.
