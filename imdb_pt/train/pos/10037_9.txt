The ship may have sunk but the film does not !!! Director, James Cameron, of 'Terminator' did it again with this incredible photo. One of my favorite scenes is the scene 'The dinner table', in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE' ... I hope to have that look when I'm in the bedroom with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF', but it's a good movie material. We have the greedy mother and all her elite associates who live off the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost commits suicide, but the star of Gilbert Grape rescues her. I really enjoyed the hanging on the boat scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long, but it's fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go see it twice if you want it, it's worth it !!!
