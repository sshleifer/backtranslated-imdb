If you want a serious pain of laughter, watch this movie, and the things that Bruce inflicts on his fellow presenter. The deleted scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they did not include them in the original movie. It can not be because of the time, since the film is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor who has been neglected for a long time. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
