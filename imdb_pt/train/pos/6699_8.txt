When Sabrina first appeared on our screens, I was about 12 years old, so I spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird situations. <br /> <br /> It's always been one of my favorite shows, the witch feeling. of the sixties sitcom 'Bewitched', but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy which made it enjoyable to watch. The characters at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal favorite, sorry he left so early) Hilda and Zelda their aunts started well but then became annoying. <br /> <br /> I liked Mr. Kraft too, he was always a little closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I loved in the first three series were the original ideas, the discovery of the family secret and the learning of new spells, but as it became more predictable. Many characters came and went, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decided to do Sabrina in college, which ruined me. Sabrina became self-absorbed in college, there was less magic, no spellbook, no aunt living with her, and Roxie, Miles, and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring, and I just watched to see what happened at the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seem wrong in any way, and Miles walked away like that. The last episode made me feel so much better though (SPOILER) having Sabrina wrecking Harvey on her wedding day for Aaron's dizzy was great! Overall a great program, if you forget the last poor two or three series, it reminded me of so many teen shows. Magic.
