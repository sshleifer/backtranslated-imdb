I've spent several times watching this since I realized it was an idiotic, dorky and dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy and maybe a bit old-fashioned. However, he is not overly sentimental, playing as he does on issues of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that holds your interest, and not everything ends as you hoped. But there is enough intelligence and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you know someone who does not like this movie, seriously consider how much you want to meet him.
