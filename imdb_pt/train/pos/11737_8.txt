Okay, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way. It was idiotic on purpose and it was one of the best "stupid" movies I've seen. The jokes and jokes are intentionally bad, but delivered in a way that gave me all the right notes. The supporting characters were rather shallow and mediocre. There is a very weak plot, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is the focus here. She is lovely and lovely. Cassandra Petersen has a world of talent that shines in this film. At the top of acting talent, she had physical attributes that were frankly impressive. Few men could disagree with that. The parts that show his figure were also some of the funniest scenes in the movie. I had a smile from ear to ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to comedy fans, and fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made over a dozen Elvia movies.
