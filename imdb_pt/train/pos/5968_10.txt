When you come across a gem of a movie like this, you realize why the '80s were the biggest decade to live. Rock music ruled, and movies too ... especially horror movies. Filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is evident for that. When rocker Sammi Curr, who was probably written after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, dies in a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie, is distracted. He goes to his friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives you a copy of the last recording Sammi made; this is the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to be played live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays, somehow brings Sammi back. He helps Eddie with the bullies at school, but then gets out of control. It's definitely a great movie. The bad news is that this movie is sold out. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it off of eBay. You should also ... $$ well spent!
