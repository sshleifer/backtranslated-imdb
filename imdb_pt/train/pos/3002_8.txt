"The Kennel Murder Case" begins in a race and does not stop until the end. Everyone had reasons to kill the victim and several people tried. William Powell is fantastic as Philo Vance, Detective Gentleman. Mary Astor is refreshing as the niece who just wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy his heritage. This movie comes paired with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disk (or check out your local library), do so. It's pure entertainment!
