Probably the best movie of the year for me. This little French film revolves around the secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends her days doing other work, uncredited, and being the source of her contempt and lunchtime conversation, which is very clear to her, being partially deaf , she reads the lips. A change is unleashed when she hires Paul Conde (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, binds them together. Carla is attracted to Paul and the fact that he makes her feel attracted to what appears to be the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel his feelings because he needs your help. He owes money to a local gangster and makes a plan to steal from him, which will involve Carlas's ability to read his lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film to an average suspense / drama is the incredible chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the movie, no matter what the other characters are on the screen, you can feel this incredible bond between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French actress Cesar for best actress). You never feel like you're watching a acting piece, this is really Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. It makes a somewhat unpleasant character appealing and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and the two times I just watched it, I wanted to go back to the movies and get involved with them again.
