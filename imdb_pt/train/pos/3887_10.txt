I was able to record this on my satellite, but I would love to have an original release in a format that we can use here in the United States. Eddie is truly glorious in this performance of San Francisco. I do not remember laughing so hard at a routine getting up. My wife and I both enjoyed this tape and its working on Glorious I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of your shows available.
