I decided to watch this because of the recommendations of this site. I would have to say it was worth the effort. However, you should be careful that this movie continues for 210 minutes. If you do not have the staying power, put it on tape and watch it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you do not mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexander is a promiscuous vagabond, a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and she provides for Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had impregnated Gilberte with whom he used to live. Gilberte left him for a less attractive man she did not love because Alex abused her and beat her. At that point, Alex was willing to get a job and help raise his son before he discovered that Gilberte had aborted him and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexander meets a nurse nymph named Veronika and they have created a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the nasty sex she'd had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and have a ménage à trois. Finally at the end, it is revealed that Veronika is pregnant with Alex's son and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as we said earlier in Gilberte's situation) that Alexander will even get a job and will be the provider of his new love and family. There is hope! With the title "La Maman et la putain" I deduce that Jean Eustache was related to the character of Veronika de Françoise Lebrun. She was a prostitute and then became the mother. So the mother and the prostitute are the same person? Anyway, what I know! French films are largely (not all) very talkative, with no political purpose, preachers, theatrical, insipid, lamentable and full of quotations. Lebrun and Leaud interpreted well their obstinate characters and realized the film together, since part of the script became a little lost and disarticulated. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort. 7/10
