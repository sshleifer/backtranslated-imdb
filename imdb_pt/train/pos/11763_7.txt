I think everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), a Taft resident, plans to do in "The Best of Times". Yes, the man who went crazy with the radio on "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to play a game that cost his school a prestigious title. But former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) is not just going to go along with it so easily. <br /> <br /> Granted, it's not the best movie for any of the men. But Williams and Russell are actually a great comedy team. And some of the names in this movie will probably give you the giggles (to say the least). Check out.
