Although this lovely work of art uses a little of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it's actually nothing like that. It is a political and cultural allegory of the post-Columbian odyssey of Mexico, as even a fleeting glimpse into the history of Mexico will attest. <br /> <br /> In contrast to "Like Water for Chocolate", "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet him at least halfway so that understanding takes a little work. (A good starting point is to see the character of the grandmother as Spain: proud, indifferent, sad and, above all, overloaded with history.) <br /> <br /> The heroin's final actions are obscure. because the "result" of the story (ie, the present) is always obscure, since we are very close to an honest evaluation. Refusing to tie loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, given the film's ambitions. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is beautiful. A great screen experience would be ideal if you can see it at a local arts house or at a university exhibit. But if not, VHS is better than ever.
