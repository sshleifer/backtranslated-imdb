Someone has noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who is serving when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant by the lake. I watched this movie in a video I had recorded on television. When I watched this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape, then slowly traversed that part as the camera retreated and showed the waiter. Listen carefully as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby, then watch closely or slow down when the camera shows the waiter, albeit quickly.
