Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during World War II. Paul Lukas certainly deserved his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brightly as the great actress and beauty that she was. I would recommend this movie to those interested then and, of course, to the fabulous films of the late Bette Davis.
