First, speaking as no fan of the genre, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuous, superb action movie. <br /> <br /> Second, it's a crazy bobo of superhero cartoon stuff. Third, the film carries a complex and important point about criminals who become criminals. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or to the outrageous domestic attacks on the Executive over constitutional rights, none is necessary. <br /> <br /> So the latest in the "Bourne" series, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (from the 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and "United 93" last year), is a significant achievement, perhaps retained, but not diminished by the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> "Breathtaking" above means both a complementary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seems to hold his breath, pushed back against the chair by the force of action ruthless, unbridled and totally full of suspense. There is no respite, no variation in the pace and attraction of the movie, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome as some music videos do after only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of his face is taking the best of Tony Gilroy's screenplay from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which does not compare well with the "Bourne Identity" written a decade earlier). <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is once again the inevitable and irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest of the CIA's fanciful agents, this time taking over the whole agency in search of his identity, his past and the mysterious agency that turned it into a killing machine. Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow, the ever-wondrous David Strathairn is the agency's chief official, against Bourne in an attempt to hide some illegal policies of "non-prisoners" and brutal procedures. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen does what looks like the good cop against the evil Strathairn. And there is Julia Stiles as the agent once again coming to the aid of Bourne; a combination of Greengrass's direction and Stiles's acting results in an astounding impact by a mostly silent character, his lack of communication and empty expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue. So good is "The Bourne Ultimatum" that one gets away with the old band of a man against the world, this time extended to ridiculous excesses, as Bourne challenges the constraints of geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building?) Why not? It looks great.) <br /> <br /> All this "real world" magic - jumping from country to country in seconds, to arrive in some unknown location exactly how, when, and how necessary - overcomes the improbabilities of special effects and superhero cartoons. And yet, only an impudent pedantic would allow "facts" to interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy.
