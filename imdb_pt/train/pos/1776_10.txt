I hated the first episode of this program ('Protesting Hippies') so much in 1999 that I avoided the rest. However, when it came on 'The Paramount Comedy Channel' I watched it in full and, to my surprise, I found it absolutely hilarious (Motto: never judge a comedy series in its first week)! <br /> <br /> In 1969, 'Hippies' plays Simon Pegg as 'Ray Purbbs', editor of an underground magazine 'Oz' called 'Mouth'. Her friends are the feminist Jill, the laid-back Alex and the imbecile Hugo. In the late 1960s there was a feeling of optimism among young people that they could change the world through the printing of magazines that no one read. Instead of mocking the ingenuity of the hippies, 'Hippies' is affectionate with that. Arthur Matthews scripts cheerfully parody various icons of the time - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous' Oz 'obscenity trial of the early' 70s. "Alex," by Julian Rhind-Tutt, strangely reminded me of Richard O'Sullivan's "Man About The House" character. It's a shame there has never been a second series, possibly because of people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', try it. After going through the terrible opener, you are delighted!
