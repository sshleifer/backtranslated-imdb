what's wrong with you, if you were not surprised by the action car sequences and the hot body of Jessica Simpsons, then you're mostly screwed in the head. Of course the film is not a masterpiece, I think it was not meant to be. It was fun and funny, I never watched the show when I was younger, I only recently saw an episode, and when I watched the movie, I felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The seats in the movie were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because they did not bore me and crawled like some of the scenes in 2theft. and Jessica Simpson is pretty hot, I just wish they'd used her more in the action sequences. All in all, I had a hell of a watch at this time and I would see it again soon and I'll buy it on DVD. People, enjoy what is.
