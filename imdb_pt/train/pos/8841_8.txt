'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The performance of the excellent cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman, who does an excellent performance, is electrifying every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke combines with him scene to scene and Albert Finney simply chews the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, criminally underused, but looks incredible for her 42 years. The script is great, the story line is non-linear, but easy to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for its blockbusters, turned out to be a gem with this one!
