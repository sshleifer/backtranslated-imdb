While I loved this movie, the trailers that circulated on the internet a year before arriving at theaters increased my expectations a little bit. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD, so do not get me wrong, I'm not saying do not watch or buy! It's just that I still think the first scene was the best, and nothing along the way overcame it.
