The FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best sci-fi movie of the golden age of science fiction movies, and what makes it a great movie is its sense of wonder. As the spacecraft lands, the public - through the human crew of ships - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the ancient inhabitants of the planet - The Krell, who died during the night. Or them? <br /> <br /> You can understand that the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted scenes, but it increases the sense of claustraphobia I feel, and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron adds even more atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocked that this movie is not in IMDB's top 250 films.
