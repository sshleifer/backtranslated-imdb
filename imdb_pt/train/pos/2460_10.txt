Hamlet is by far my favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is a great actor. His interpretation of this was incredible. His soliloquies were breathtaking. Since it is rare for a movie to keep my interest, however, I was involved in that particular play. I recommend this to anyone, both a Shakespeare fan and those who are not much. This has everything the modern world looks for in their films: murder, betrayal and deception. Not to beat Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs plays all the work. It leaves no stone unturned. When you finish the movie, you will feel as if you read the piece yourself. Hmm like you say "two thumbs up".
