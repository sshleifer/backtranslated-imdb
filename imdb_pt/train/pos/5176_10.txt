A must see the movie for anyone who already went to camp, or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. It's funny, it's compassionate that makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits start working. If you have not seen this movie yet ... what are you doing? Get out of you and run in the store. Have a nice summer :)
