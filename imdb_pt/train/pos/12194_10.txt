The noir surreal film released shortly after the "real" classics, which define the genre "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Welles films should not be judged against the others. He was playing by different rules. In fact, he was playing. This begins where other femme fatale films are set aside, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical rapid fire style), dialogue (a lot of "hard-boiled" philosophy) and unusual acting (good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional). For Welles, "genre" may have meant "formula," but he seemed to enjoy using "mysteries" as the backdrop to his "entertainments."
