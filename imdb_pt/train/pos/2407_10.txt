The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (a believer in the Bible). I do not follow the crowd of believers in the right wing. I got out of this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me, in their attempts to take over the government, they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it Judas Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not understand, although Jesus said that his Kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly showed a little of that. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He was also a very handsome Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a watch movie and more. <br /> <br /> Very satisfactory.
