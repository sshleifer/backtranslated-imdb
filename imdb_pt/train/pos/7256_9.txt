I saw the long day dying when I first went out to the movies, I thought the film gave a good point of view to the soldiers, who gave a realistic account of the men at war. The plot moves at a good pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well-developed and believable. David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the lead role with conviction, as well as Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) I was surprised, that I was unable to Encounter this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel that has become the forgotten film, which is sad as it is superior to many other war films that I have seen.
