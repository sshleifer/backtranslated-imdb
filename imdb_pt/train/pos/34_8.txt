What a fun movie! If you are a fan of Giallo, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. For starters, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the innocent wide-eyed Bouchet as the guilty woman fearing for her life. The murder scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially pleasing and have enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes unexpectedly and really makes the movie start well. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most exaggerated and interesting killers I have ever seen in an Italian film. The 70s and fashions are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting, with the laughing Red Queen crossing the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the movie. The contorted plot kept all my interest. Finally, the score of Bruno Nicolai may be the best I've heard of the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I could not get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times are at the end of the movie. First, the person responsible for the murders is very easy to detect. If you have seen more than one Gialli couple, you will have no problem determining who is behind the murders. Secondly, the end seems a bit rushed and, as a result, is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not the one who needs all the plot points explained to me, but I'll admit that I can not explain everything. A second visualization may just clarify this.
