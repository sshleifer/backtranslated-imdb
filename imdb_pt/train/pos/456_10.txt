This is a beautiful spiritual restoration film. From the use of the royal village that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired cast, every choice was perfectly right! The silent joy of this film is not flawed after repeated visualizations. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would love to see the Enchanted April released on DVD in widescreen format.
