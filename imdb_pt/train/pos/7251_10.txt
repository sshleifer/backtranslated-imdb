I've seen this movie only once, for about 25 years, and to this day I always tell people that this is probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and only thought of dialogue, I found the film fascinating and even found myself holding my breath to make no sound. I recommend this movie, I wish it were available on DVD.
