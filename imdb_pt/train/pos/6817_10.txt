I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy film b / c of the true meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the fun action shown in the film. I see the time @ at the top about 4 X per week and I love it! I wish a sequel had been made to see more of Susan's father in the past and see how Susan distracted herself with her new little sister and not having phones, computers, gameboys or anything from the 21st century. I hope everyone has enjoyed the film so much how much I think you could say that I'm one of the best fanatics and I do not care. The lil boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was just adorable, I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if it's played in movies or TV shows?
