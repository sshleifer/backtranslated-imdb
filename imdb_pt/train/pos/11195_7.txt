The title has many meanings - the boxing ring where the differences and grievances are fought, a wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels that his problems are over and the cause of the problem, a ring bracelet that Bill hands over to Mabel as a symbol of love. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer, Danish Carl Brisson, got his start in Alfred Hitchcock's films in "The Ring." A very young Ian Hunter, who went on to have such a long career in films, plays Bob Corby, who catches the attention of a beautiful girl, Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) at an amusement fair. She happens to be hired for "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), but that does not stop her from flirting with Bob. Bob is persuaded to go "a round" with Jack. He goes several rounds and wins - he's a professional boxing fighter and he and his manager came to the fair to find out if Jack is as good a fighter as they've ever heard. He offers to take Jack and Jack out, along with his coarse trainer (the great Gordon Harker) to make his fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he is good. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep attraction she and Bob feel for each other is still there. Jack is suspect and puts everything in his training so he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally, a boxing movie where the hero does not get off the rails - Bob behaves and does everything that can be a champion - if Mabel acted the same way !!! She left him for Bob - and the fight at the end is powerful. It is intensely realistic - occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. From being raw and enthusiastic, Jack is almost knocked out - so between the rounds, reuniting with Mabel, gives him the courage to triumph. The question is why would he want her back - from the start she did not think about starting a case with Bob - why would not she do it again? <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with symbolism. Jack, greeting the promoter, switches to Mabel's hands accepting a bracelet from Bob. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, the Bobs bracelet slides down his arm. In the end, Jack sees the reflection of Mabel in a bucket of water on the side of the ring and this gives him the confidence to continue. This is an excellent movie that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
