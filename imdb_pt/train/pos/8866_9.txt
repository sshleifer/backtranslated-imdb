"COSBY", in my opinion, is a CBS hit! I'm not sure if I've ever seen all the episodes, but I still liked it. It's hard to say which is my favorite. Also, I really loved the theme song. If you ask me, even if I liked everybody, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn had not died during the show. Since that happened, I've always wondered what the show would look like. Everyone always performed well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend that you take it just in case it leaves the air forever
