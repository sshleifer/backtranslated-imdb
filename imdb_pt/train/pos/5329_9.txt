This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was absurd. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were planned. <br /> <br /> But since you can relax enough to laugh, it was an exciting joke combining the Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> Bandits were more foolish than evil. The good ones were not good enough. Black actors played normal characters instead of black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of a baby added a nice touch. The sympathy may have been a bit difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree on the acting. It was overall very good. I really wanted to punch Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And, after all, is not that the mark of a really good movie, wanting to punch Judge Reinhold?
