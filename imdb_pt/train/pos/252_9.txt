The performances were excellent, the costumes provided a unique feel to the period and being a Victorian historian, I was impressed by the precision of the weapons and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I would not say that you need any knowledge of the saga of Kelly to stay with the flow of this film but to understand the events and attitudes of the time you will require some basic background knowledge. Do not expect, as some silly people do, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, was, at the time, a country during childhood. <br /> <br /> OK, the story had some elements of fiction, but these are needed for a greater number of followers of the film. Gregor Jordan said on the DVD that he wanted his film to "inspire interest," and that's exactly what happened to me, so the film is here. <br /> <br /> Watch and You Will not Regret
