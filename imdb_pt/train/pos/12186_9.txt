It's not as good a movie as many believe (including my late aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But because of the best sections of this noir film, particularly the famous "fun house" finale, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of importance beyond its real value as a key to the saga of Orson Welles' failure to conquer Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In 1946, Welles's position as a Hollywood figure was mixed. Citizen Kane was not recognized as the greatest film ever seen because of the way he was attacked by the Hearst press and Hollywood members themselves. Welles' attempt at total control (directing and producing and acting) of his films seemed to threaten the whole system. His best work in this period was like Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE, supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but actually shot in large part (with the blessing of Stevenson) by Welles. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film that benefits from a postwar interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood, it was just a great record. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain his critical skills with his production of THE WORLD TOUR IN 80 DAYS. But despite the help of Mike Todd and Cole Porter composing the score, the musical was a failure. His failure occurred at exactly the same time that his wife, Rita Hayworth, was on the rise with her portrait of GILDA. So the marriage was also ending. <br /> <br /> Welles had to make money - his Broadway production led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in possible rights to the film AROUND THE WORLD for Todd (which he would eventually regret), and also sold the idea of ​​a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin, who was to be directed at him turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> The story goes that Welles, with a $ 10,000 account to worry about, called Cohn and offered to make a movie with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do it, but of course he asked what the film was. It was a wise question. Welles was on a pay phone in New York, at a pharmacy that had a book department. He took a book titled THE LADY OF SHANGHAI and loved being a big suspense. Somehow Welles convinced Cohn, usually cunning, that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he would seek the rights and sent Welles a $ 10,000 payment. After Cohn hung up, Welles bought the book and read it-and found it was too bad. He spent some time rewriting a treatment and script that would build Rita's character Elsa Bannister. <br /> <br /> Certainly it has a curious plot development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor. He rescues Elsa Bannister when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a criminal lawyer with a high reputation. She convinces him to hire Michael as the captain of his yacht. The cruise also contains Bannister's sinister partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa. When they can Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby continue to appear. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes an offer to Michael - he wants (for reasons connected with his so-called fatalistic view of modern society). ) quit pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes obscure here) he can still get his life insurance (although dead?) And use it to escape to the southern seas. He'll pay Michael $ 10,000 if he pretends he's going to shoot Grisby. This includes signing a document admitting the murder (Michael does not realize that such an admission would do away with the need to produce a corpse if all other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Of course Grisby is dead, and Michael is arrested for it, and for the murder of Broome (shot with Michael's weapon). Michael is tried with Bannister defending him, and discovers that the latter is doing a second-rate job because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the real killer, and manages to escape shortly before the jury verdict. He is knocked out and deposited in a desert carnival, and this leads to the famous sequence of "house fun" and the completion of the film. <br /> <br /> It is a terribly confusing movie (as I had commented). This does not mean it's not worth seeing - it's visually stunning. Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the judge's chambers, where he plays the bailiff on the judge's bookshelf, breaking the glass. Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth plunging from a rock, reflected on the binoculars of lascivious Grisby. The acting is very good, especially Sloane (possibly the best role of the best actor). Glenn Anders was one of the main actors of Broadway. He rarely made movies before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable. Also Ted De Corsia does very well with Broome - a detective who is really looking out for his own interests, at his own cost. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, it turns out to be a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, MANHATTAN TALES, and BLOND STRAWBERRY are exceptions), and it's a siren memorable. Welles's O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a nice but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL, NO CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it's a good movie for all of that.
