Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in 19th century India who, with the help of a water boy (Sam Jaffe), get rid of the thuggee killer cult area. The chemistry between the actors helps make this movie one of the most fun of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the marginalized boy who is mistreated by everyone and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Vaguely based on Rudyard Kipling's poem. A must see for anyone who likes this kind of movie.
