I really enjoyed this Summerslam due to the appearance of the arena, the curtains and just the overall look was interesting to me for some reason. Anyway, this could have been one of the best Summerslam of all time if the WWF had not Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now it's time to have a huge fat man against a strong man but I'm happy times have changed. It was a terrible main event, just like every game the Luger is in is terrible. Other games on the card were Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Celestial Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his great monster a Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Ranger body Kid, Bret Hart first takes Doink, then takes over Jerry Lawler and things with the Harts and Lawler has always been very interesting, so Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took over Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger, this game was annoying and has a terrible end. However, it deserves 8/10
