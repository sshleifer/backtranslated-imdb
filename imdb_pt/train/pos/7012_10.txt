Despite being a ripped film, it's definitely a "feel-good" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith, as always, does the work and does well. I could go on but choose any ten of the "10" ratings and they said that too and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a bystander. Her performance was very enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her performing in many upcoming movies. <br /> <br /> And this movie demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing more to prove in terms of his acting ability.
