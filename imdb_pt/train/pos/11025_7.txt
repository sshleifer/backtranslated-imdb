Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin whose admirable making this film about an expert climber who is held hostage with a friend by a gang of dangerous criminals in search of cases full of money stolen from the Rocky Mountains . Sylvester Stallone is as impressive as Gabe Walker, the seasoned climber, especially in the action / fighting sequences, but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. Because of the movie, although I want to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the film. The action / fight sequences are well executed, but as mentioned before, some are not very realistic, no matter how hard you are. The climbing sequences, however, are very well done, because instead of doing the whole movie in a studio somewhere the chosen locations seemed very real and the visions of Ariel from the mountains are wonderful adding a touch of reality to the movie. Deaths are inventive, while others are predictable. Villains are solid, but it would have been better if they had focused on a more central, rather than having many of them. The rhythm of the movie was a bit slow, but the good overcomes the evil in this movie. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, then you'll probably like that too. Overall, Cliffhanger has character development with plenty of action, drama, suspense, thrills, thrills and good cast performances that make this movie worth watching.
