To get in touch with the beauty of this film, pay close attention to the soundtrack, not just the music, but the way all the sounds help to weave the images. How beautifully the initial scene that led to Gino's expulsion sets the subject of moral ambiguity! Notice how the song introduces the characters when we are taken to Giovanna's wedding. Do not expect to find much of the political life here in Italy in 1943. That's not what it's all about. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led to a word that goes beyond neorealism. At the end of the film, there are moments like the Antonioni landscape that has more to do with the characters' inner lives than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
