American vehicles by director Paul Verhoeven are of varied quality, but most of the films he has made in his native country are undisputed masterpieces. This is the story of the alcoholic (and bisexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful woman who is rich and very strange. But you do not know that he is only interested in finding the beautiful male lover of the woman. Meanwhile, the writer is plagued by strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonition. Suspense Hitchcockian fascinating, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half, and a quasi-religious surrealistic saga during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of the future director Jan de Bont. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
