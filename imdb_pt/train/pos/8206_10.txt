Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th installment of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still has, Harry was told to take a vacation after some trouble that happened because of an assault (where the memorable slogan "Make My Day" comes!) But the city he took on vacation was worse, woman became vigilant after a rape attack on an amusement park and begins to receive the punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer, which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, which are best known for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Worth watching if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or as thrillers of action and crime.
