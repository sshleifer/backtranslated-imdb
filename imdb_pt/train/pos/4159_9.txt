Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a great movie that tells about Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows in the process. The journey on the train represents Tetsuro's journey from childhood to manhood. The music and visual styles of the film are a bit dated (you might say it's a 1970s movie) and the animation is just a little better than your "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so strong it does not really matter. Must do for any fan of animation!
