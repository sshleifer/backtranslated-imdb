A Scream in the Dark A Scream in the Dark was a movie that I hoped would offer Meryl Streep's phenomenal performance and a solid, though not-to-be-noticed, movie. This assumption came from the fact that, in addition to Streep's nomination for Best Actress, the film received little attention from the major prize groups. <br /> <br /> Little did I know that CRY IN THE DARK would be such a fascinating, well-built drama on every level. If you ask me, this is an understated classic. <br /> <br /> The movie opens quite slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain at a relaxed pace and really realizes that deep down they are an incredibly loving simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments for capturing a family on vacation that give an imminent sense of the oncoming tragedy, also showing the caring happiness with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous phrase "A Dingo Took My Baby!" has become a kind of punchline these days, the film never comes close to laughable. Azaria's actual death is horribly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the public horrified and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in court and focuses on Chamberlain's ongoing struggle to prove his innocence to the press and to the court, which suspects Lindy is a homicide. The fact that it is clear to us from the outset that they are innocent makes the tense judgments all the more exciting. As a member of the audience, I was totally invested in the Chamberlain situation ... and I was genuinely angry and hurt and sad when they were made to look so terrible in the media. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was not at all friendly, but they always had valid reasons to keep their points of view. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film is very deep and perfectly captures the central element that makes this film very different from other court dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this movie are Streep and Neill ... and they deliver it anyway. For me, this ranks as one of Meryl Streep's (if not 1) best performances. Despite all his domain of different accents (which, of course, are very impressive in themselves), Streep never loses the heart and soul of his characters. I think this is one of Streep's most subtle performances, and she leaves the park. And Neill, an actor who never impressed me as well as being charismatic and attractive in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's best work to date. It's a shame he has not been recognized by the Academy with a nomination for Best Actor to match Streep ... b / c the two interpret each other brilliantly. <br /> <br /> More emotionally thrilling than most movies, and also incredibly suspenseful ... A scream in the dark surpassed my expectations. I strongly recommend that people who only know the movie like the movie in which Meryl yells "The dingo took my baby!" watch the movie and see how much more CRY IN THE DARK, then that line. <br /> <br /> ...
