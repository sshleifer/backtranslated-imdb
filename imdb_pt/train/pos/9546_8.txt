Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto's "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of the 1999 film Yamamoto with the same name. I doubt I get the chance to see the original, so I'll keep commenting on this. First of what is "Meatball Machine"? A simple and ambitious low-budget industrial speckled film packed with great makeup and blood effects. It's not something you'll end up writing books, but it's still fun if you enjoy this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows the well-known plot. The boy loves the girl, but is too afraid to ask her on a date. The boy finally knows the girl. Girl is infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn, also turns into that thing and goes in search of saving his love. Is he going to succeed? Who cares, as long as there is carnage and death I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively clich√©, but it does the work well enough to put the film in a bloody confrontation. between the two main characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into their lives. And yes, fortunately it shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a movie without budget splashes. It's not exactly painful to the ears, but it's not exactly good either. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, apart from violence and bloody blood (as I have not mentioned enough), are cyborg designs. Made by Keita Amemiya, who works on creating extravagant creatures and fantasies for movies and video games, is well known. The necroborgs, as they are called in "Meatball Machine", seem incredibly detailed. Without the use of CGI designs Amemiya is a dazzling fusion of flesh and metal, painfully impressive in its appearance. Capable of turning various body parts into cool weapons, such as chainsaws, rocket launchers, blood shotguns, and so on. Although you can easily recognize the low price of the movie, the necroborgs are of class A. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien", all made with low budget and extra Ketchup mode. It's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.
