This movie is fun, fun and quality. The film cleverly follows the guidelines of the book and tries to follow the exact lines. The actors are all appropriate and you would expect them to be part of it. They use some famous actors that give a great effect in the film. The graphics are a bit dishonest in some parts, and there are some mistakes throughout the movie. There is no such thing as a spotted yellow lizard, for example. The camp is not as horrible as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the events in the field as much as the book. His whole group is mentioned a lot in the book, but it's not in the movie. Overall a great movie for a rainy afternoon
