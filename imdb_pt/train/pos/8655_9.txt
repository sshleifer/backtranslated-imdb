"Kalifornia" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and can easily be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 1990s. The film has a very stylish surface, but behind it there are many disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrible violence they inflict on others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is its performance, Brad Pitt is incredibly great as a psychopath named Early. Pitt conveys his scary character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is so good playing his na√Øve girlfriend, his innocence is almost heart breaking. "Kalifornia" has a very simple plot, which advances steadily and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into an agonizing wave of murders, while Pitt releases his psychotic personality. There are a lot of shocking scenes, and all of this leads to a powerhouse climax that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that should really be watched because it is an intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not just because of its violence and violence.
