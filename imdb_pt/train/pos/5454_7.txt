This is one of the most daring and important films of the so-called "Pre-Code" made in Hollywood during the 1930s. Unlike some pre-coding films that occasionally involved in subjects that would never have been allowed after 1934- 5, this movie plunged completely into a very sordid and fun storyline from start to finish. The conventional morality of the late 1930s and '40s was definitely not evident in this film, since the film is essentially about a conniving woman sleeping to the top - and no excuses for the way. This "wide" person liked sex so much and used it on everyone who could help her get rich - something you would never have seen in movies made just two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck working undercover for her father. In addition to being his boss, he is also his pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so he allows the illegal bar to work with impunity. Although not particularly clear here, it seems that Dad has "rented" the body of his daughter for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after almost being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer his skull, Barbara has had enough and goes to the big city. It does not hurt that he still exploded and killed his father, but the feeling that she was whoring and had nothing to show seemed to be the impetus to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the Depression Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank. She starts off in a handsome job as an archivist, but in the space of what appears to be only a few weeks, she sleeps from one job to another to another - until she is sleeping with the bank boss. and his future son-in-law !!! This all ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem much shaken by the death of these two men. In fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again she is at the top (perhaps in more ways than one). <br /> <br /> Now, so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and impenitent. Barbara played 100% sociopath - a woman with no morals and no conscience - just a desire to extract as much life as possible, no matter who hurt her in the process. However, the courageous writers and producers "cowed" and found it important to give a redemptive end. Considering that this woman was so bad and conniving, her change of heart in the end was a big disappointment and strongly impaired of the film. In many ways, it reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - as again, a bad person somehow "sees the light" and changes with a not very convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is try to watch RED HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. The RED HEAD is very much like the BABY FACE, but it does not show any magical transformation at the end - the protagonist really is a skunk in the background! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very similar to RED HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar conniving character. Both are classic and slightly better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is an incredible curiosity of a brief period of Hollywood films, often ultra-despicable and, in this light, worth seeing for Cin√©filos. In addition, The Duke fans take note - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.
