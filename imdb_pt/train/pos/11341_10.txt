This may just be the most nostalgic journey in time and in time until childhood begins a journey of reminiscences back and forth, up, back and forth, up and down and around. The boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Lion Ludicrous, and even the wicked Witchie Poo as well. The last day inspirations of Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday Morning Special Preview" Sigmund & the Sea Monsters, and Land of the Lost both the new and old are what this same show fill the gap for as well as The Donny & Marie Show, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka Brady Bunch Hour and even the Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Maybe even other things between & Beyond the Buck continue to move on and even beyond expectations, as well as unexpected boundaries. Now as we update in March 2006, we know that Jack Wild is gone and is now even more symbolic for us to really be nostalgic.Including now in August 2006 when Jack Wild is invited as himself in Sigmund and The Sea Monsters as well as when in a last episode HRPuffinstuff also does and to remember all the other nostalgic trips of all Syd & Marty Kroft characters, including the HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, the Donny and Marie Show, the Brady Bunch Variety Hour, also known such as The Brady Bunch Hour, etc. In fact, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer a.k.a. "Ste" of Framingham, MA.USA.
