Being a big fan of the genre of romantic comedy and therefore having seen a large number of these films, it is rare that one seems to me totally original. By the way, it's just as rare for me to be gasping for laughter during several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the floor, but I'd say it's probably the best, since this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on "comedy," and in any case it increases the limits of credibility a little more than I I like most rom with what to do. The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not only in this movie, but in any movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a "10" instead of a "9" as a rating because I believe that many people use it indiscriminately and therefore the maximum rating loses part of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but this is one of the few movies I've seen where I'd say she's completely overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are chosen as protagonists, but for me they are the second violin of the tricks of the bumbling intellectuals. A genuinely laughing movie.
