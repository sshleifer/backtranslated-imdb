Simply great movie, no doubt. Great history and superb performances, whether Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. Hindi film industry is going without shame with Mallika and Co, this film is totally free of vulgarity and therefore bound to fail in the vulgarity addicted our Indian society. But the message and concept that this film carries are absolutely superb. Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as musicians. I think Vipul Shah should have given Gujarati a little touch particularly on the song as well. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he considers himself a pop star, but this is not the film where presence is needed - he only gets along with Govinda-style songs. I felt good serious music with some good Ghazals or sad songs that could have made this movie more memorable.
