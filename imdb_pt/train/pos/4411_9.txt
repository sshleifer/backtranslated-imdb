Easily 9 out of 10 for a movie by the director we will continue to grow to admire. But do not watch this movie waiting to be "entertained." Ang Lee objectively analyzes a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What's beautiful about the movie, like all of Lee's films, is that he does not "stand aside" with his characters. He creates characters, incorporates them into life, problems and ambiguity ... and gives them a reality that often reaches much closer to home than with many who feel comfortable. This movie has action but it is not for the action lover, since violence is deeply disturbing and far from being gratuitous ... ie like the characters, it is real. And as one would expect in one of the most horrendous wars of mankind, violence is horrible. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of the greatest human ambiguity that surely lived within the Civil War, it is a masterpiece. Was it the war on slavery and an abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to confuse this line so popular in such representations as Blue and Gray. Nor is it about idealism, however, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It's about freedom, about the desire to have something that is yours and to fight for it. As you watch the characters, you wonder, "How can they be struggling to preserve slavery?" The fact is, I do not think they really are, and in that film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the whirlwind of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn from are struggling with the senses of loyalty to the "home," though they have never examined what the home represents or whether they actually embrace its values. The scenes of the lyrics are very touching and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty that stretch to the limits. And when the tension finally breaks, and these characters suddenly find themselves "free" ... we see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> All this blended with Lee's beautiful embodiment of the environment of mankind with breathtaking views and pictures. Lee has a style that is his, somehow European, in his "art" (slow, unhurried), Asian in his epic and development of history, and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many Americans. Relax, let go of your preconceptions about what the Civil War is, what "western" is like, what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you to a world so fragile, so difficult, so real that few of us can see comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he did in Ice Storm. Again, the film is slow and with no apparent "direction" ... a clear sign of Lee's ability to drive without "imposing" himself on the story or the screen. His direction is amplified by what he takes from Jewel (yes, the singer), an unproven actress who does an incredible performance. <br /> <br /> A movie for those who love movies and are not movie lovers. epic Hollywood standard.
