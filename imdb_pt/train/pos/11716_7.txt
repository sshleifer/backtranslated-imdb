Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the television host for the horror movies of the night, and when the character turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to places on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. It reached the peak of its popularity in the late 80's, and the film ELVIRA, LADY OF THE DARK was the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is flyweight. Horror film presenter Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the property will provide enough money to support a show; she is disappointed to find that she inherited a decaying house, a poodle, and an old book. It turns out that the city is puritanical beyond description, and it causes righteous indignation everywhere it goes. It also happens that his great-uncle is secretly an evil sorcerer and very keen to lay his hands on the "old book." Throw some teenagers, a stallion and an odious woman with falsehoods and there you go. <br /> <br /> No one would accuse her of being a cinematic masterpiece, and she creeps in from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates a tremendous talent from start to finish: touching, sexy and blending low mood with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film as a master of ceremonies in a circus of cheeky and often self-mocking jokes. From a disaster of FLASHDANCE to witchcraft madness, it is never less than amusing. It's a tremendous amount of fun, and the conclusion of the film comes to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira improve her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything, so let's just say that you will have a lot of fun discovering. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is good and there is little bonus material, but if you are in the mood for something silly, this is sure to respond to the craving. And if you've never seen swivels, you're in for a surprise. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
