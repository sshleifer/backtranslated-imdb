Jack Frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence, the prison truck in which he rides collides with a chemical ship filled with a chemical that turns its molecules with snow on the ground, turning it into a snowman. Being a killer would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. Jack now begins his fury again by killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost gets a chance to become a horror classic, but it's a fun movie. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but do not take it too seriously.
