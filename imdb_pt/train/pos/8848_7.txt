I watched this movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and could not remember why (besides, I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film does not have opening credits, I could not even remember who had directed it. While my wife and I were watching, I turned to her for about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this movie, but something about it will not let me stop watching . "Then there's a series of half-dozen scenes in the middle of the film that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It was only when the final credits rolled that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet. movie. And I thought - wow. I'm surprised that Lumet has taken over what was really a mean and dirty story about really bad and broken people. But it's a testament to his talent that I was so impressed when I did not realize it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is very, very good at this movie. How scary good. Put this against Capote and I would say that the Oscar should have been for this movie. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the special report with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about how to make the movie - it's fun and educational, with Hawke playing the eager student to learn at the feet of the master. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors - kissing your butts constantly !! <br /> <br /> There are many violent and melodramatic films that are empty ciphers when all is said and done. And there is one element to this in this film - that actors fill the air with sulfurous outbursts of emotion, and when the smoke disappears there is nothing left. Nothing resonates on a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us Network and Twelve Angry Men - movies that, in their own way, were elevated to the highest echelons of cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is not on that level. But there is something about it that lingers. And maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My final comment is on the comments - if you look at the number of comments on this little movie here on IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con - is a good indication that something special is happening with this movie.
