A single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working in various minimum wage jobs. When she is dismissed, she discovers that she is unable to support her children (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the last of whom has asthma. So she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. Soon, she becomes addicted to the drugs she is selling. His life collapses, especially when his children, that is, his eldest son, discover the truth and threaten to leave it. So she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug kingpin she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This life movie has some of the best performances I have ever seen! Diane Keaton goes a long way, and her character seems crazy, but she was extremely convincing. She is much more suited to drama than to comedy. However, the best performance of the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. He is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but tries to be the adult of the family. His acting was especially great in scenes in which he confronts his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job. <br /> <br /> A movie that is worth watching, especially because of the performance of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
