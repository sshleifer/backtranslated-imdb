As a person who sought the existence of a "professional" person with income supported by a degree in Chemistry and a Masters in Business Administration, my sanity was always kept spasmodically in external indulgences in more artistic things. My graduate classes have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and art design which also included screenprints. <br /> <br /> I also stay healthy with jogging, hiking and lately hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Running, walking and walking approaches the land with time to stop, observe and listen, and also shoot or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In this context, I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally impressed by the documentary content of the artist Andy Goldsworthy, as well as the skills and smoothness of director / cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I really could not separate the art of Goldsworthy with the Riedelsheimer camera path. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
