I must admit, at first I was not expecting anything good, at all. I was just expecting a rough movie promoting the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I'm glad to say there's so much more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is not so good, but it's not a drug. or, the whole cast is well disciplined and brings enough strength to their characters. The effects have no consistency, but the action scenes are satisfactory. <br /> <br /> What really interested me was the essence of the plot, although it combines fantastic elements, it also exhibits a raw reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and feelings really affected me and I think that's the key to this movie. Think about it and convey all the anguish. It meets all expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
