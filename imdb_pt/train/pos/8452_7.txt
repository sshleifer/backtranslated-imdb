Super-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - check it out! Weapons that hardly need to be pointed and still annihilate everything - check it out! Angels Mobile Suits - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This, Gundam Wing, has a good character development, real world complexity, interesting ideas and a beautiful look. With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although he is still absolutely obsessed with Heero Yuy, the main character in the series). The above-mentioned Heero, initially a cold but tough butcher, becomes increasingly human, while still remaining in character. And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whose name is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelance, and the White Fang command shows how some people can actually get lost in their own creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also very good - reflecting how the real world works. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it becomes somewhat of a responsibility that this complexity is not used to its full potential. <br /> <br /> The ideas at the core of the series - the need to fight, the desire for peace, etc - are those that resonate to this day. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the "War on Terror" and all. But his exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible play, forming some of the best writings of the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor. , which dramatically causes him to lose some of his edge. <br /> <br /> In terms of eye drops, which is what this one has in buckets, everything from moving suits to the battleship Libra (no, not the inner absorbents). his idiot!) is well designed, and explodes into large orange balls (which is bad because better animation would have had better blasts). But who cares?! Stuff explodes, and that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In short, the complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you've lost a lot. Poor writing can leave you shrinking, and sometimes the animation makes you stay "WTF?!?!" But this is offset in his classic style of animation, his scale, sparks of incredible dialogue and his more mature exploration than is expected of such Japanese animations.
