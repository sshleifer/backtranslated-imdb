The title is the sound that one of the characters makes while driving his imaginary cart through the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who actually live in houses falling apart at the edge of the dump. It is a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first colored film made by Akria Kurasowa is something I wanted to see a long time ago. Strangely, it was listed as only available in a reduced version of a three- or four-hour original due to an error in the runtime of some promotional material. I was waiting for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to find in Criterion's recent release that the 140-minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Finally sitting down to watch the movie last night I am of mixed emotions about the movie. Firstly, it's visually connected to all of the movies that followed. You can see all the other Kurasowals remaining six movies reflected in this movie, until the sunset painted. It's a remarkable film in the use of colors and you can understand why it took so long for a film that it would be happy (of course there are also failed projects). The film is a work of visual art (although be warned if you will see it on your widescreen TV, this was filmed at 1.33, so it will appear in the normal proportion of the TV.) The rest of the film is a bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not come close together. As separate stories, they all work well, but as a filmic whole, they do not hang as one. I do not blame Kurasowa since one can not always hit things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman, who specializes in multi-character movies of this type occasionally bombarded. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there is no reason to see the film. Like all Kurasowa films, there is always a reason to see your films, whether you work or not. The first trip from the "tram" is one of the best things that Kurasowa has ever done and worth the price of a rental. It is one of the most magical moments in movie history when the trolley is inspected and taken away. The father and son living in the car are playing (although, in the end, very sad) and there are other pieces that shine (like the cast that looks great) and one should at least try the movie as something other than a man we often associate with samurai movies or crime dramas. <br /> <br /> It is an intriguing failure of a filmmaker which means in this case to be better than most of the successes of other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 6 and 7 as a whole, much larger in pieces.
