GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (of four) Gone in 60 Seconds is an energetic, stylish and stylish action photo with high octane star power and many incredible cars . If you are an interested viewer in cars this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), it is worth seeing just to indulge in the brilliant vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, his sense of action and excitement make him a moderately successful summer thrill ride. <br /> <br /> The film stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a movie. the young bandit Kip Raines, who, when the film begins, can not deliver a long list of expensive cars to powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened because of it, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars model, color, year, and make in just four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis spends the first three days recruiting a team of thugs to help him pull off the robbery. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy, but rude, retired cheat, meeting Memphis through previous deals, a guy named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall) as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). Contributing to the thrust and tension of the film is a subplot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect previous experience that Memphis and its crew are to the height of no good and keep an eye on them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; the audience knows these people through rude lifestyles and takes on tough personalities through the stiff and elegant atmosphere of the movies. To make matters worse for the film, the dialogue can not define the characters with a brave cultural tone. I'm not saying that I think cursing and vulgarism are necessary for thrillers to flourish; In fact, I honor the director's decision to sustain from extravagant language in a movie that could very easily earn a R-note. However, I believe in a film like "Gone in 60 Seconds", to develop strongly the lighting of the character, the dialogue needs to be believable and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the high level, perfectly cast responsible performers. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and compelling. The sleazy appearance of Angelina Jolie is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously robust and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains standard structure, with a first satisfactory act that elaborates the style of the story and the motifs of the character, sets up an accelerated action theme, but lack depth and strong character introduction. In the second act, we are faced with a few more problems: history loses time for much of this segment, never building for the third act. While the middle of the film takes a lot of time, and a sex scene provides a solid midplane, not much happens. The third act is practically an adrenaline that contains furious excitement from wall to wall and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Gone in 60 Seconds" contributes very well. deal with the inspiring action scenes. These are scenes like the car chases that make this movie work despite several destructive failures. Dominic Sena, whose career has mainly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds," which will give audiences two hours of commotion, excitement and excitement, but not much else. <br /> <br /> <br />
