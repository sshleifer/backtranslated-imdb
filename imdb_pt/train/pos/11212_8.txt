This photo came out in 1975 and was the second in the three-part series of Sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last one we saw Sheriff Pusser was lying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in an ambush on Sunday morning. After Pusser recovers, he goes after the men who killed his wife. Pusser is able to complete revenge or the mafia tries to get him out before he can. The only thing that bothers me about this picture is that this was a true story. How can you go out in a city with this kind of crime and still do nothing about it? Since there was no real actress in this picture, I can not give 10 weasel stars, but I can give 8
