The documentary features an original theory on "weapons, germs and steel." The series graphically depict several episodes that strongly support the theory and defend the theory against common criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply intrigued to find user comments complaining about the lack of new information in these series. It is said that the documentary presents information that is taught in high school. In fact, this happens. In fact, I really enjoyed the original look at the information I've known since high school and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So if you like to know why things work, if you dismantled the phone trying to determine how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how the cows are milked, you will enjoy this series. A definitive recommendation.
