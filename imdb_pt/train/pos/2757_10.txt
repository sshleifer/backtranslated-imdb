If you would like to see a movie of another kind, if you feel the love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally deficient, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end, when love gives you instructions, not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my opinion. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is enough advertising to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (Majesty's color) by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, almost with similar taste.
