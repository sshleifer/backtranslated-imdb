Grande Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting ability and is in full shape as a lyric singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (mark A'Vuchella de Tosti and La Danza de Rossini). MGM's art and music departments also did a good job. This film could be perfect, were it not for the clumsy presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in the 1950s style in scenes prior to 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better character, and Blyth should have less demanding productions. Note also that Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano.
