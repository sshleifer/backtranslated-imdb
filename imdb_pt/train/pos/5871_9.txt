I appreciate every painting in this beautiful film. These are ordinary people, people we all know, who suffer a bit in their life and have some luggage to carry. Just like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker bring their interpretations to life and are excellent, but Harris is especially bleak and therefore very real. You would swear that he really is a trucker who drinks to feel nothing. Baker as her bitch sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in a scene, it seems she has never received flowers before and probably has not. Well worth it.
