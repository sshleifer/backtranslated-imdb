A rather funny and well-paced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as an unhappy, quick-talking bandit chosen by a demanding US Treasury agent (David Morse) to be launched on the streets of New York to find a weird computer thief. hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards dead. "Bait" marks the second film of Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the task reasonably well, although it does not exceed his first film. What the two films have in common are the action sequences, which are excellent. <br /> Foxx is very good here, although his character is boring at first, but throughout the movie I started to notice in. Hutchinson is wonderful as the mentor who can be relentless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in "Marathon Man". Morse is just like the agent who presents the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all costs.
