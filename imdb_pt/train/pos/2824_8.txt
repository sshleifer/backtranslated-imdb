The American film debut of Greta Garbo is an analogy of how our lives can be taken from the course by fate and our actions, as in a torrent, causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant in love with the character of Ricardo Cortez Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but is easily influenced by his domineering mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation of being a loose woman. In fact, part of his attitude is bitter about Rafael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> She returns to her home to visit her family and ends up facing Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows she's the famous La Brunna, and Garbo plays her role as the diva she really was and is reprimanded with such a cool arrogance in her later portraits. Ricardo Cortez remembers Valentino very much in appearance in this part, and he was prepared to be a clone of Valentino by MGM, though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right. He is credible in an unsympathetic part as a weak mama's son, and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie. He can not beat Leonora when she returns home, and later, when he follows her, his courage is impaired. <br /> <br /> This film is beautifully filmed, with brilliant sequences of storms and the scenarios representing Spain at the time are authentic. looking. There are also some great secondary performances from veterans Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Although this is a lost love story and missed chances, I do not think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together because he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman, and I I do not think I would have been happy in a small village. The ending is true for life and does not punch. <br /> <br /> Watch this as Garbo's premiere in American cinema and a forerunner of things to come.
