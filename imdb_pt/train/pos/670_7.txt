THE LAST WAVE will never win the mainstream audience. It is a slow but fascinating film for those who are willing to accompany it. An Australian property lawyer is invited to take up the case of five Aborigines accused of the murder of one of their own. All kinds of portents and omens soon arise, for the death of man involves a tribal matter which was not for the white man's court, and soon the lawyer is having difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. It seems the end of the world is near, and he and the Aborigines may know this, but no one else knows. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here. David Guptil, a familiar face from several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of five Aborigines on trial. THE LAST WAVE is simply not for everyone, more than MAGNOLIA (both happen with strange things falling from the sky). Check it out on a slow Saturday night.
