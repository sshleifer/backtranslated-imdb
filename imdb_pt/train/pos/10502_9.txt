one of the funniest marios I've ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls and good graphics for your time. there are also a multitude of mad chiefs and enemies to fight. Sometimes levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the more difficult levels and still need to be more talented to fight a boss, this can be annoying. another complaint is the angle of the camera; although it works reasonably well most of the time, can be a pain in certain situations. if you are a big fan of mario; this is for you. even if you're not a big fan of it, I still recommend this. it's a great game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very rewarding. good to play in short periods of time. will almost certainly hold your interest; You sure hold mine!
