I find it intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin of these women, encouraged the Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the theme of a movie. They could certainly be considered the "skeletons" in the family closet. The DVD's extra features include several contemporary fashion designers, crediting some of their ideas to these eccentric women. I would say anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion of these designers fascinating. (that is, "are they insane or am I missing something?"). This movie is hard to find. Netflix does not have that. Facets does, however.
