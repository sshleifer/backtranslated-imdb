Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most charming movies I have ever seen. An excellent cast, tight edition and wonderful direction. A caper movie that does not run out of standard tricks. <br /> <br /> You can not say too much about this movie without spoiling it. The slogan says it all - 5 guys. 1 insurance. Brainless. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an incredible cast. George Clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
