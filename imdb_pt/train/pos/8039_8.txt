Sniper gives new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, many shots, everyone dies, bam bam. "Sniper" takes the war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly conveys all the emotions it craves - the human abandonment in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush of the moment they pull the trigger. A seemingly low-budget movie offsets every flaw with action, suspense and excitement, because when it comes down to it, it's just a shot, a death.
