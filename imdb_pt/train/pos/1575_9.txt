The film of van trotta rosenstrasse is the best film I've seen in years. I really am not really interested in historical background movies, but with that she gained my interest for that time !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the movie has been the scenes in New York, and the impression I have had to "try to be as American as possible" ... which I think absolutely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes on the back really came to my heart. the German actress katja riemann completely deserved the prize. she's one of the most amazing actresses I've ever seen. in the future I will watch more of your movies. Lucky for me that I'm a native German speaking =) and only for a year in the US, so I'm back I'm going to buy some riemann dvds. <br /> <br /> For all those out there who have not seen this movie yet: WATCH !!! I think it would be a long time to describe what it's all about yet, especially all the flash backs and switches are difficult to explain, but simply watcxh this, you'll be zesty !!!!!!!
