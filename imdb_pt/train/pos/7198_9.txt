This is a very good movie and I enjoyed watching it several times. Michael Caine is amazing as always. Michael Caine received a kind of reputation for having any role in any film, no matter the quality or lack thereof, but he makes a good move when playing Sidney. From the beginning, it's so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such scary things as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something so witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with such a good cast led by Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> I'm really reluctant to go because if anyone gave anything about this movie would be a crime. Just watch and worship.
