I first accessed LoG accidentally one night while watching television: since then, I've never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> The humor is very strange, as a cross between the social commentary of Brass Eye, the great of the Fast Show. one-liners, and an incredible storyline that seems to unfold every week without ever going anywhere. The best example of this was the special material of Hillary Briss - what was that? <br /> <br /> Humor will not please everyone. Some will say that you are very sick, and it is easy to see where they are coming from. However, try it. If you do not like it, do not watch it, but if you like it, you'll be glad you took my advice.
