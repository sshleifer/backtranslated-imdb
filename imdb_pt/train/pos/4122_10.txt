I'm sure I would like to see a resurrection from a Seahunt series updated with the technology they have today that would bring back the childish excitement in me. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero every week. my vote for a return of a new sea-going. We need a change of pace on TV and this would work for a world of underwater adventure. Oh, by the way, thank you for an outlet like this to see many views on the TV and the many movies. So either way I believe I have what I want to say. I would be good to read a few more points on the sea ​​hunting. If my rhymes would be 10 lines you would let me send, or leave me out to be in doubt and I have to give up, if it is so then I must go so let's do.
