I really love this TV series. contains interesting and beautiful animation. I can not believe they cut TV, and also that I never found out if cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV show of all time. I know it's too late to expect that they will start the series again, so I'm really happy to have watched. I created him so much about a woman named Cybersix, she's not human. She goes by adrian sieldman, a man teacher at a school. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she is just disguised as a man in the day. At night cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von Reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he thinks she's alive, he uses everything he can to capture her. <Br /> <br /> If you've never watched it before, you should download it entirely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut ???? some people have problems. but I'm happy to have watched the 13 episodes.
