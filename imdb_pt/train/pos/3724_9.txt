Tigerland follows the lives of a group of men recently recruited into the army who are summoned to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this point, the US knows they are fighting to lose the battle, and the director leads through a 16mm portable documentary taken from the lives of several recruits at the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is more a study of character without real plot, but focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a disorganized but intelligent man who just wants to escape the camp. We are led by several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general. and very memorable. Also the use of cinema and style by the directors works so well because it looks a lot like the old movie you always see about Vietnam. It's great to see how the film shows that all the struggles and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting in this battle. The scene in which Boz steps away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device sums up everything about the war in a nutshell ... and is futile. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not just about Nam, but about whom individuals have to decide what is morally correct by being "in the army". <br /> <br /> Rating 9 out of 10.
