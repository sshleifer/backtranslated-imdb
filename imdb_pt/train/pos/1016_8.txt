I would have given this series otherwise great 10 votes if Claudia Black had not stayed in it! His inclusion as the foolish "Sail" brought the series down in my opinion. Bringing her as regular while including Ben Browder to replace the RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were recovering from the loss of 'Jack' and we did not really need it. series has turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the series was first announced I had reservations that could live up to the movie but after watching the first episode, I have to admit that I was hooked . I've always been waiting for new episodes with great expectation
