I totally disagree. I thought this was a great movie for kids.dawn gilligans wells, and promised to show off a poorly known dishana.it was disneylike and so could hardly be dismissed as meaningless fluff. it's scary and it was not meant to be. I'm not going to ruin the end.but it was unusual the way it was done.want to say that the kids characters were great and I did not know what to expect in the end. plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these children were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.It also helps them out of a jam in the end.It also has the plus not being overly long. I think watches in less than 95 minutes
