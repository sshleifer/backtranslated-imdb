After reading Diamond's book, I was a bit disappointed with the series, but overall, it's quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is reassuring to know that the "culture warriors" are working hard, seeing "attacks" on the "Western Civilization" under every rug. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond A Little Lazy? Right. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing of all. He uses the phrase "guns, germs and steel" at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We got it, after the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simplistic (in the series)? Right. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing a very long and complicated story up to 'smallpox, swords and horses', involving all the conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things actually contribute (but do not fully define) the reasons for Spanish's success against established cultures. <br /> <br /> Is he preaching against Western Civilization in any way? No. No word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck has played a major role in determining which crops have advanced faster, * not * that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all factors than influencing how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
