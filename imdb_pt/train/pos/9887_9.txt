"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely spoken. The movie only exists in a low quality VHS format. It's a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD. "Erendira" is stunning and gorgeous with its realistic magic images. "Erendira" is based on a tale from the novel "100 Years of Solitude". Erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally sets fire to her grandmother's house. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forces her to prostitution to pay for the damages. The whole town gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the theme is hard, the film does not exploit sexuality. It is done in a mature artistic way. The movie also has some amazing costumes. Some of the most surreal aspects of the film that stand out most are the origami birds that turn into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center. Erendira is an incredible film, that even manages to play in the humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD release. As they would say in Spanish, "It's very very good !!! Excellente!
