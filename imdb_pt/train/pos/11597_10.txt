I read so many comments that I also shared about remembering this movie and wanting so much to see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Luckily, because of doing a search and finding the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie that I remembered. I then did a search and found the movie and was so happy to watch the movie again 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and so I want to thank you all. I want to share how I managed to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well. It was in VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney "Call it Courage", that contained two films, the second being "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". That touched me as much as 40 years ago and now I have my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and saw several copies of it there. Enjoy, I know I did! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he cared for. When the time came to sacrifice the eagle, the boy released the eagle because he could not allow it to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after releasing the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive. The proximity that the boy and the eagle shared in the desert was so touching and the footage really remarkable. What a wonderful time that was. I've never seen anything get close to this movie!
