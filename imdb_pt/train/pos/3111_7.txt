He now has a name, an identity, some memories and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but still, they tracked him down and destroyed the world he hardly built. Now he wants some explanation, and to ride the people as he did what he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he's here with revenge. <br /> <br /> OK, this movie does not have the most elaborate script in the world, but its themes are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like all Hollywood movies since the late 1990s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is a story of superheroes. Jason Bourne is a project similar to Captain America, which is completely wrong. In the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and accepted them in the second. He now fights against what he considers to be evil, after a person close to him was killed (his girlfriend in "Suprematy") by them. This is all part of the superhero story, including a character with (super realistic but impressive: he almost invincible) powers. <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that the evil he fights around the world (there are no borders in the Bourne movies, the characters are going from one continent to another in a snap) as in the best seasons of "24," an American enemy, which is beliefs that he fights for the sake of his country blind him completely. Funny how "crazy patriots" are now the N.1 enemies of paranoid Hollywood stories. <br /> <br /> In addition to all these interesting themes, the film is not perfect: Nickie Parson's female character is completely useless for now, and the direction is uncreate when it comes to dialogue scenes. But that does not matter, because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are quite impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is talking about the "Waterloo scene" and the "Tanger chase" and everyone is right. I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tangier, which reminds me in its exaggeration and madness of the works of Tsui Hark. The Bourne Ultimatum is definitely the best film in the series and a very interesting and original action film.
