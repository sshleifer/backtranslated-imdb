I can not see the point of burying a film like this in sulfuric sarcasm when it is by no means meant to be more than a vehicle for entertaining the children and preparing them for the next line of goods to beg madly. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children sat in silence throughout the event and loved every minute of it. Granted, the villain is a bit overdone with his silly fantasy and maniacal laughter, but this is a lot easier to catch than dark, dark, and very morbid Pok√©mon. <br /> <br /> My kids have been watching Pokemon since it started and they are coming soon to the ages where they will "postpone children's things" and pass on to others. I'm glad we took advantage of this together.
