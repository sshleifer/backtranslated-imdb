Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shaken by an astonishing childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He leaves his job as a dishwasher and leaves to become a rich people smuggler. He meets a misfit named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two grow remarkably close and soon can not live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso did not tell Joe, and this could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together. This is one of the biggest movies ever made. It is a moving and devastating portrait of very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. Your story is devastating to watch, but it's important for people to see. It's one of those movies in which the characters are very much like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes meet on the street. The difference is that this movie is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see the pedestrians in this movie treat them like dirt, especially if we someday be one of those people. However, the film does not try to fool you. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the hustling lifestyle. It is not a pleasant and laid back lifestyle as many Hollywood movies portray, such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a male worker is a dirty, tough and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves as Joe's character in this movie does. What surprises me most about this movie was that it came out in 1969, and it passed the test of time perfectly. Today's audience will still find great significance in this film and still love and enjoy it as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969. The film was rated X, but what I notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic and effective manner. Anyone who has had sex before, will know how funny, clumsy and scary it can be, and this movie does not shy away from any of it. The sex in this movie may not be as graphic as it once was thought to be. Films that have been classified as MID MIDWIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO IN PARIS, and FRITZ THE CAT, all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get with an R rating today. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem pretty strong, but they're certainly not sexy. They are not graphics, but they are realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when watching this movie. The language of the course that is used in the film, particularly the word "queue" is used effectively and is not free. Violence is too shocking to watch until today, but again it is necessary for the plot to depict the world of a cheater. I am very happy to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still as affective as it was in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough and hope you continue to find an audience because it is truly a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are harrowing and amazing to watch. They have never played roles like this before or after and are completely different from the usual. You'll forget who's playing in a few minutes! <br /> <br /> -Great score <br /> <br /> -It is nothing dated or overdone as many films from that decade present themselves as today <br /> <br /> - Quick and fast editing job <br /> <br /> - For mature audiences only. - The opening scenes are well done, but they can be a bit stronger.
