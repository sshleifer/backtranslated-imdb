Much like the comedy duo of his title, "The Sunshine Boys" became a classic forgotten 30 years later. It is hardly mentioned alongside other great comedies of films of the 70s. This does not make sense, given the singular singularity of this film, perhaps the best that Neil Simon wrote. Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now bitter. A 73-year-old solo actor who can not get a job in a potato chip commercial. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is sure he can get work if Willy only agrees to meet with his former partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for a celebration of show business nostalgia on ABC. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" has to offer from the start when a series of 1920s clips showing various flickers artists long before us for the accompaniment of "Be A Clown "by Cole Porter. Then there is the current scene of the movie in Manhattan, where wide pants and wide polyester ties are plentiful. Periods collide in Willy's glorious mess in an apartment in Manhattan, where framed photos and cartoons of dead celebrities disappear from the walls in lurid tabloid headlines and empty Zabar grocery bags. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you could even feel like you were in that apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy has clearly lived there for a long time. He is sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" A pause. "It does not matter, it's tea." <br /> <br /> Old men living alone can be a sad material in almost no one's hands, but Simon's smart insight and infallible sense of character transform that adaptation of his 1972 success into comedy. gold. The surprising thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much that rubs their noses in the almost existential condition of Willy without leaving you of nothing. "89 years old and just like that, he dies of nothing," Willy says of an old friend songwriter, before deciding that the man probably died of writing a song that rhymed "lady" with "baby." Burns won an Oscar for his understated performance as the gentle, but austere Lewis, but it is Matthau who brings this home, his makeup and his proud, but ragged bearing, actually selling the idea that he He was 73 years old when he did that. Willy is detested in the extreme, totally deserving of Ben's description of "crazy and crazy man," but you twist for him everywhere, enjoying his little victories, even when they come at the expense of the patience of others. His lines kill you too, especially when he's trying to kill Lewis, for whom meeting on TV turns out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You're out of reach!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm still in demand, I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room were on fire you would not be hot," Lewis responds. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross photographs everything in a very casual and discreet manner, with low lighting and medium-range photos, even in thrilling moments, so as to leave room for comedy and for the zen message of grace of the film, through silent acceptance. You never have the feeling that you're watching a movie, one of the many charms of "The Sunshine Boys," and Ross's direction, like the acting of the three directors, helps a lot to achieve that goal. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard, especially when the guys are watching people go by, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes it seem like a pleasure because, for us, we watch.
