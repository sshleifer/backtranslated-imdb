Maybe I'm a sap, but this is the sweetest movie ever! I first saw it when I was 4 or 5 years old, and I cried with my eyes closed. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I've seen it more than 25 times and solulated each one of them. Do not worry, they are tears of happiness! And everything is not sap! There is a lot of humor and comedy too. Normally, the whole thing of the talking animal can be a huge obstacle, but in this film is not the case. My only word of advice: Even if you love it, do not see the sequence ... cheesy! I suggest everyone check this out ... you will not regret it, no matter how old or young you are!
