A message movie, but pretty good. Excellent cast, from top to bottom. Interesting in that the plot of Bette Davis is essentially the story back! The extremely negative critics (name given to the scriptwriter / playwright, associating this in some way with extremely negative comments about 'Angles in America', etc. etc.) make the film very preacher about Germany in World War II. Wow, that's a bit too sophisticated for an understanding of morality to me. <br /> <br /> Theatrical and movie theaters and acting styles vary over time, and of course 70 years later, that particular movie would not be made that way. Yes Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but although made the same year and both having Nazis in them, Casablanca is mostly a love story. The love story in this film ranks second in the espionage plan - another thriller. Both have a fairly large number of slightly extravagant accents and wonderful actors. The children are a bit boring and could have been edited
