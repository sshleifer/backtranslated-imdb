The bill was essentially a cultural source from which emerged a beautiful rainbow haze of introspection, inspiring famous derivatives such as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3 and more recently The Wire. With multifaceted characters and story lines that were described as "4-dimensional Shakespeare," The Bill grabbed you by the collars of the first episode and simply would not let you go. <br /> <br /> The show covered, anticipated, and even occasionally caused all major global events between 1984 and 2010. The most famous prescient moment being episode 19 of the 5th series, which aired on the eve of the Second War of Gulf. Detective Jim Carver's misleading drugs - and finally the end of his career - attacked Craig 'Fun Boy' Richardson's apartment in early 2003, was widely seen as a predictive allegory of the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction after invasion several months later. <br /> <br /> However, it was Bill's job to try to highlight some of the lesser known problems experienced by the police officers who earned him more praise. This was a comprehensive drama covering sensitive areas such as helmet phobia, uniform cross-dressing, homosexuality in the van, lost truncheons, casual drunken bestiality (lamented), siren aversion syndrome (SAS), groin chaffing caused by pursuit of suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many, many other issues that still upset, disturb, haunt and excite police officers to this day. The last word should go to one of Bill's most famous fans, Nelson Mandela: "It is no exaggeration to say that I would not have been able to survive the dark void of solitude that summed up my last years of incarceration on Robben Island, were it not for Reg Hollis's casual and warm buffoonery.
