This is really a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the Fred and Ginger dance is among the best of all time. But basically, all the Fred and Ginger movies are the same. After singing and dancing ends, it's the other characters in the movie that make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the movie's subplot is the reason I watch it over and over again. He adds to this movie, it does not decrease it. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is on my top ten list of all time. It's great to see him as something different from a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Maduro, etc. he was very nice and could climb to the top on certain occasions. All Fred and Ginger films had subplots that relied on other actors to fill the space between musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened in about half an hour. I just wanted more people to appreciate Randy and I felt the need to fight for him.
