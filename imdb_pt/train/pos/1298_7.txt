A real anomaly in French cinema, this desperate work has no equivalent in contemporary production. It is better to have to look at the side of Louis Malle's "le feu follet" (1963) (The Fire Within) to find something not entirely different from Harel's effort.

Immersed in the human race, he seems to live his life as an entomologist, studying his colleagues. One of them attracts your attention: Tisser and Jos√© Garcia represent the most degrading part of the decade. Then Tisserand will become a kind of prey: all his pessimism will be affected by this poor man. The scene is night. The climax reaches the strange relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unsatisfied, unless he .... Well, now the film has a more conventional turn, so to speak (Clouzot's misanthropy perhaps), but for a while. The form is strange beyond the comment There are no voices-over wo, one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one for the aforementioned hero. The story takes place, now in Paris, now in Rouen, Guy de Maupassant's town. In a scene with his psychiatrist, the hero says that the madness of the writer was only the expression of his dislike for Man and he draws a parallel between his despair and Maupassant's. <br /> <br /> This depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience. for very short stretches of porn movies, but because after watching it, you may be feeling depressed.
