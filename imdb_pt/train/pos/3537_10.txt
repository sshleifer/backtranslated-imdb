This James Bond game is the best bonus game I've played in my life, it's my favorite James Bond game so far because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are really fun, they can really be difficult times. more fun playing the missions have many actions that the weapons you use are very good. The cars in this game are amazing, the car missions have lots of action and are a lot of fun to play. The voice over the actors are really good and it's cool that Sean Connery makes the voice of James Bond is also really cool because he looks like Sean Connery when he plays James Bond in the movies and the other character looks pretty much the same as the look on the movie. The graphics are very good in this James Bond game. In addition, the game follows the movie very beautiful, but not all, but most of the time it does what is cool. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********** off ***** *****
