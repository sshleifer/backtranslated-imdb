This is apparently one of Shemp's first short films with the Stooges. (This excludes his previous years of vaudeville with the team). But the comic timing of the trio is much better here. Besides the intense scenes, there are others more subtle, but equally funny. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or look at the real object, causing Moe to exclaim: "Oh ... highly polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is in his most dazed idiot. And the bully may seem scary, but he's somehow funny. He seems as frustrated and baffled by the Stooges as "regular" people in other short films. <br /> <br /> For Shemp aficionados, this is a must-see episode. Will not disappoint.
