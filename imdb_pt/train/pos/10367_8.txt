When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark," I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what he portrayed. When I saw him for the second time in an Australian Film School class, I noticed a second point: communication problems. You see, when a dingo took Lindy Chamberlain's baby (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were sad but did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and so they could not regret it. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone began to believe that Lindy did too. <br /> <br /> The point is that the wrong message was communicated to the public and turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It may be one of the greatest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media regardless of the political opinions of any medium. <br /> <br /> As for performances, Streep does an excellent job with an Australian accent (not surprisingly there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably be amazed at what you see here. Definitely one of the best Fred Schepisi films of all time.
