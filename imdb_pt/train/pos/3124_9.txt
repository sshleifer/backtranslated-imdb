Jason Bourne is sitting in a dusty room with blood on his hands, trying to understand what he has just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in New York describes the agency's response to what happened on the screen. An American flag stands proudly in the center of its foreground table, but when it speaks, it flips out of focus when its plan enters a morally dubious territory, as if it does not want to be associated with the course. action that the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security. <br /> <br /> This shot effectively captures the mood of the movie. In addition to portraying Bourne's quest to discover how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. <br /> <br /> It's also probably the best movie you'll see in the movies this year. <br /> <br /> It's so intense. Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine) "This is not a newspaper story, this is real" and in the audience you almost believe in it. The camera shakes but remains firm enough for you to see everything and feel you're there with Bourne while he tries to escape his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys look like they're the characters they're portraying. , rather than just being actors playing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast and well choreographed that they seem instinctive, rather than planned for the slightest movement; the stunt work is nothing short of incredible. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is simply amazing. He continues to advance toward his conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves him struggling to put the plot together; the script provides the information you need in the fastest and clearest possible way before moving on to the next piece of action time. Although they are generally simple (Waterloo's sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone), they are loaded with such a dramatic intensity that you can not take their eyes off them. The film is so focused on moving forward that you can not help being dragged by it. <br /> <br /> With its intense action games, brilliantly paced plot and intelligent examination of the decisions taken in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our time. The ultimatum is its peak.
