Do not think of these films as just another kid's movie - the whole family can have fun. It's a weird mix of a movie because it seems to have a movie inside it, but at least it makes sense at the end (unlike modern movies!) It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent storyline, good characters - well, the Muppets, a list of smaller celebrities that the films would claim for) What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some touching, some funny, some serious. all make a nice family movie that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * The movie's celebrities are actually the top stars of the day but there is only one true star in the movie and no one dares offend Miss Piggy. !
