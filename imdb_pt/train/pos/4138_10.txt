Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits appeared on the screen. Soon I discovered who was Florence Rice, a real beauty that turns into a simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this engaging ensemble piece. From 1939, it's a different time, but there lies the charm. It transports you to another world. It starts out as a light comedy, but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from heroine to comedians. She is absolutely charming, yet strong, vulnerable, evolving from a girl to a woman. Watch your facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I'm going to look for the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is Flynn / Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer great comedic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30/40 movies, do not miss this one!
