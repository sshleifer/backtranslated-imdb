Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM, there is a lot of inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who engages emotionally with a woman he does not really understand, and whose naivety is even more striking in contrast to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that Third Man has a better worked storyline. Zentropa is a bit disconnected about this. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it very coherent would spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is inexorably gloomy - "noir" in more ways than one; No one ever sees the sun shine. Relentless, but intriguing and scary.
