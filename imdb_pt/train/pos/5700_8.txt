I read lots of negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to watch it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> It is a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from many points of view, from an eccentric cast of frequently drugged murderers / suspects. including the late porn king John Holmes. Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot - I would like to contribute more to a review than a synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers went so far as to give this film its lowest rating due to violence, but I did not really see it. MANY modern movies have been worse - Private Ryan's Rescue turned out to be more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied bloodstains than actual brutal murders (the murders described in this movie were made with lead tubes after all). I was fascinated by the two halves of the movie - the first showing John Holmes as a hungry drug addict with hopeless money, and the second half showing his side as a small conspirator in a bloodless binge. The film has an excellent acting, although Dylan McDemorant seems more than a little out of place in his motorcycle personality and bad boy goatee'ed personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also amazing - a fantastic mix of 70's B-side rock and obscure pop, scattered for a couple of hours everywhere right wing Boogie Nights.
