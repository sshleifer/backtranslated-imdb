Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his non-sentimental touch is noticeable in this rather original tale of songwriters who work so hard for the legend of burnt music Oliver Courtney. Obvious misunderstandings get out of the way very quickly, thanks to the sky, and what remains is a witty and joyful mix with some beautiful (and some more forgettable) songs, Crosby at his most charming, a great turn of Broadway legend Mary Martin. and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant supplying most of the cynical barbs (the Levant is in a weird form and his jokes do not date at all). A delightful and recommended surprise for all fans of the genre.
