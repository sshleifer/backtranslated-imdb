After the success of Die Hard and its sequels, it's no surprise that in the '90s, an excess of' Hard to Kill in a ... 'films fit the wrong guy, in the wrong place, in the wrong concept of time . That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot in Stallone's career. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is a great dream, especially for those who are experts in mountaineering, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as an exaggerated heap of junk. Stallone even got hit by a horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, it's really a very amusing and undeniably fun joke that offers many emotions, and unintentionally, lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> You have to love John Lithgows. wickedness, his ticking, every band of evildoers and, best of all, the permanently besieged and unhappy "turncoat" agent, Rex Linn as Travers. He may have been Henry in "Portrait of a Serial Killer". 'but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a performance worthy of a fucker like Hal, he insists on constantly screaming in painful disbelief at his captors' that man has never hurt anyone' And while he certainly can not be, he really looks like Frank Ralph Waite The character is smiling when the girl falls on his death. <br /> <br /> The mention should also be made to former London 'Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the bad British guy who appears as Hal as Human Football, yeah, you can not help but take advantage of that bit, Hal needed a good kick. <br /> <br /> So forget your best judgment, who cares if "this could never happen," lower your expectations for performance, turn up the volume and have fun! And if you're looking for Qaulen, he's the one using the helicopter.
