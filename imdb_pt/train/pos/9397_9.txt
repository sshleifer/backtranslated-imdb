Vaguely reminiscent of great westerns of 1940, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about consciousness, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a young, down-to-earth Texas native who goes west in search of work and money. He finds them both, but not in the way he expected. <br /> <br /> The movie script contains many surprises and twists. Outstanding cinematography, skilful editing, and melancholy western music heighten tension and suspense. The expansiveness of the great country of heaven provides a wonderful backdrop. And the performance varies from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western song gives the film a strong ending. <br /> <br /> Correctly labeled as neo-noir, "Red Rock West" also seems to me something else. The plot is full of surprising coincidences and an unlikely time, so much so that others may consider the script flawed. Ordinarily, I would agree. In this case, however, when combined with the melancholy atmosphere, and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal everyday life, coincidences and unlikely times suggest a story that, in addition to "noirish", is ... surreal. It is almost as if fate deliberately intervened with unlikely events to force Michael to deal with himself. From this point of view, the coincidences are not script failures. They are necessary points in a nightmare story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining in his always clearly stated voice that ... a young man, looking for himself, stops in a small town, almost deserted a thousand miles from nowhere. It's your final scale on a journey to ... the twilight zone.
