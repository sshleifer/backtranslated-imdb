this movie is absolutely hilarious. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow transformed into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. He then heads to town and begins to terrorize the venues. it's up to the local police chief and a few other characters to try to stop him. its done on a tiny budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this movie is that it knows its crap. the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer of the snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - it is one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. along with comedic boldness, there are a few other great comedy moments - hear early on the voice of a father who scares his kids to death, and the funniest rape scene ever committed to the movies. fantastic brega fun
