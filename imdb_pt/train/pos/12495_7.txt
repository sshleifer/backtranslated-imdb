What's good about it: some small creative and genuinely scary effects that will come under the skin of even the most experienced horror fans. Do not rely on the banal soundtrack blows for your "catch" moments. Even if you've seen it all, there are still some things in this movie that will let your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> What could have been better about him: The acting was sometimes flat and unconvincing. He had "shot-on-video" quality in some places (though most of it hit the atmosphere he was struggling with), and camera work is full of unnecessary close-ups of meaningless actions. Although the effects are genuinely scary, I think they may have gone to the pit a few times too much with some of them. The end seemed rushed, and it covered up what could have been more shocking moments. The viewer is left to discover a lot of things for themselves, not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed it. <br /> <br /> Still, a good indie horror movie that is easily several steps above average. It's worth the rent.
