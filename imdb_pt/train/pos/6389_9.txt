Passing Stones definitely one of the best independent comedy movies of all time. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this. This movie, for some reason, did not get its credit. First, let's start with the story that everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters behind when he tells of a hidden treasure, he not only unites two families, but also initiates a spiral adventure. Mix in a Polish translator, a mother in a coma, a crack head with tower syndrome, a distorted homosexual hypnotist and a drag queen, money not only makes the world go round but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie would have to be the sister / crack addict with Tower Syndrome, her sudden explosion will make you cry and imitate for weeks.
