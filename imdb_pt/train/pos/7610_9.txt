I've only seen Season 1 so far, but that's great !! A wide variety of people stuck on an island. No one is who they seem to be and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their closets ... it seems like Melrose Place knows the Crusoe family and why is this so good? Probably not, but then ad a spoon full of X files, a dose of "what"? and a great "hey" and an island that is everything you have ever dreamed of - in your craziest nightmares and you will be lost to. The story has so many twists and turns that it's unbelievable. Great assembly, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the world is human (well almost everyone ... I think ...) with good and bad sides. But strange, oh so strange ...
