I thought this movie was very well done, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also very good and believable. How true this is for what actually happened, I have no idea, but I portrayed why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps those in authority have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged, so perhaps there was more truth in this movie than at the beginning? In many ways, I remembered Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. After all, I recommend this movie and I'm a bit confused because it did not do better in theaters.
