This is much more than the charming story of the middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing (although this is also so). It is the tale of a person who is learning to love life again, overcoming all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once again. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the attitudes that slowly change from modern Japan to everything from ballroom dance to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... some where you will want to get up and dance tango ... and many others where you will feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese cinema for those who may have the impression that all Japanese movies are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
