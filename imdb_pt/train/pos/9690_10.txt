Paulie was cute, cool, nice and very rewarding. I went to this movie expecting to see a typical "family" movie, which in a few moments left me unconscious and drooling on the floor. My mental picture changed immediately when I was quickly captivated by the integrity of the film. It is rare to find a complete family film that can be coined as "healthy." Most are cheaply written and produced purely to attract young family members, who then drag the unhappy elders into a numbing mind in 65 minutes of overused gags and tangles. <br /> <br /> Ah, yes, Paulie had a plot. It told the story of a young woman (Marie) and her best friend, Paulie, the parrot, who could incredibly talk and talk to her quite often. Marie's stupid father found this unbelievable, and thought that Paulie was damaging the mental health of her 4-year-old daughter, and quickly separated them. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he tries to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Oh yeah, Paulie really could (smart) talk and had a New Jersey accent. Nice. The plot got thick and fun all over, keeping me drawn. Paulie is the best family movie I have ever met and I wholeheartedly enjoyed it. Ever. Seriously. Grab a copy, sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family. Without sleep. I promise.
