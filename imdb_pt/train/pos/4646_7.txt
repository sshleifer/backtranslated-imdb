I did not know what to do with this movie. I think that's what this is all about. I've never seen a movie like that and I doubt if I really do it again. Glover brings together something that is unique to him. I think to enjoy it you have to read some of his poetry, maybe see one of his slideshows. I really like this guy, he's so bizarre I can not help it. Note: I saw this movie before its final issue, so maybe what I saw and what the others saw are different. I'll know, I think, if I choose to see the movie again. I think I'm going to have to be properly influenced by drugs ...
