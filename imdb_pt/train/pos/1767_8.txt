Steve Carell made a career by portraying a rather strange straight guy, first in 'The Daily Show' and then in various supporting roles. At Virgin, Carell found an intelligent and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet and solitary life. Andy is a little strange, but in a way, he's kind of a cool, clumsy guy. One evening while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Roman Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have some respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him by helping him end his virginity. And so begins Andy's journey into adulthood. Andy is the innocent par excellence, and most of the humor stems from his naivet√© to the situations he finds throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross material, but most are just smart comedy well done. In addition, I found some parts of the film really well touching, while Andy finds himself developing romantic relationships and friendships, perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a moving comedy in their places. Still, every good comedy I've ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be "The Wedding Crashers" earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but maybe it's a bit more vulgar in some of her jokes. I particularly loved the end of the movie, which I thought was a perfect way to end the movie. Without giving anything, I remembered 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun; leaves you giggling and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when a comedy ends. I recommend.
