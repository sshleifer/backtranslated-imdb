I thought at the beginning this movie would be your typical Western movie, however, it turned out to be very interesting and kept me fascinated to the end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston (Sam Burgade), "Midway", 76, had past experiences with James Coburn, Zach Provo, Deadfall, 93, and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he would have caught up with him and paid back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), 96-year-old "Portrait of a Lady", got caught up in this situation and found herself among sex-hungry men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions and I was quite surprised by the conclusion. This is a very entertaining film and the acting was excellent.
