My sister and I rented this movie because we were in the mood for something vulgar and not so demanding to watch. However, the film far exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It is much more than just a representation of a century. He has very real portraits of the characters inside him and most of the actors do an incredible job. The different stories are produced in conjunction with real time images that give it a unique touch. While watching, I really felt that I cared about what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to give Julia Stiles lots of praise in her interpretation of Katie, she was great in a way that stood out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone ..
