We took a few episodes to "get in" on the Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were transitioning from The Sopranos, a very different mindset structure. But as soon as we got to the essence of the series, we were very quickly hooked. It's a shame that the series ended when it was starting to look good in the excellent category: Dark Angel was much more than a regular TV series. He kicks ass and rocks as action takes place, but the characters' interactions and social reactions to the "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. That the story is set in the future keeps the climate surreal and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed on our faces (hence not spoiling the "fun" for those who do not like being lectured during entertainment), but all events and the human / corporate interaction remains relevant to the present. We all make judgments, we face our own prejudices, but in the end the question of who you are lies: do you sit and close your mind to it, or do you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice, this series empowers them. For those who have never had to face the issue, this series "sneaks in" on this message under the pretext of pure action entertainment. It is much more well done and well written than most TV series; I am very disappointed that it ended before it could really kick in at high speed.
