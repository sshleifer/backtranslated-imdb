Maybe it's me and my perverted ways, or the fact that I tend to have a very sick mind, but I rented this movie randomly on a very strange night and to my great surprise, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that she had been banned for 25 years and realized that she was prepared for anything she offered. I was clearly mistaken after seeing ... well ... everything, to shorten the story. I can see why this was forbidden, not just for sexually explicit scenes, but for bestiality. <br /> <br /> Of course, as it is loosely based on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, one of my favorites, tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening about a dream about a duchess being chased . by a beast that is hell-what-what-was-it-was-like-with a huge erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation. Of course, the beast gets what she wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they keep playing in the woods. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there's so much more! <br /> <br /> Not only can we see interspecial sex, but there are also horses, the nanny who gets down and dirty with the slave when she is not fucking in bed to get her ... er ... satisfaction and the girl daydreams masturbating with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and enjoyable, but it took a while for my dad to talk to me after he watched after I went to bed ... I was 15 years old. Words of advice when watching this movie: Make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and see with the curtains closed. It might be fun, but I doubt there are any other pornographic films like this.
