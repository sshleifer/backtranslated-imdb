But the fun is in the trip. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both extremely easy leads on the eyes, the support cast's humor and the jokes really made me laugh out loud several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a romantic comedy cliche. But the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your true love also sounds true in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is dead-on and the acting is well done everywhere, and on top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress deserves honorable mention! For those who panned it for being predictable - If you want a movie with twists and turns that keep you guessing ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it was worth every effort along the way. <br /> <br /> Great date movie, great movie for a happy scream ...
