The film was very touching. It was tender and funny at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand that part of her story had to be brief, but I wish I had seen more of her - she's a real pro. You will be able to remember experiences from your own life, hopefully in a positive way later. watching this movie We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in a Q and A after viewing. He is a wonderful, intelligent, eloquent man and a "real person." It was a really nice evening! This is a must-see movie. You will be so grateful that you went.
