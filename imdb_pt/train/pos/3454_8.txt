First, I'm not a Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, actually I'm not even a big Justin fan, but I liked that movie. I work in a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast I had never heard of I had to see what it was. I did not find Justin acting so bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that did not even make the first credit list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it well done. The character of Cool J was clearly in conflict, but I honestly did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is, as always, the wise mentor he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was there. His character does not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott did the best job as a homicidal cop. Really believable and really in character, it scared me a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I was really expecting a lot to be honest. Horrible side effects, unwarranted action sequences, things like that, but it was amazingly well done and I did not find any of it. Every shooting had a point, it was not clich√©, really solid. <br /> <br /> Overall, incredible cast, decent story that kept me interested and action enough to make me jump. I do not know why it did not appear in theaters, it was better than some trash I saw on the big screen. I'd say it's worth seeing.
