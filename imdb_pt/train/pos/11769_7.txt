I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a really bad movie. But when I put it on the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays very well as the Sheriff. The 'final' scene at Bill's house is excellent, good camera, great dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie stole $ 12 million from the Mafia. Along with his wife, he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the Mafia tracks him and wants $ 12 Million. Bill can only trust the only person he knows from the inside out.
