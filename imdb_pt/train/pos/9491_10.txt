Henri Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it certainly is not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre. The action takes place in the fictitious western state where the fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides that the president was killed by a lone shooter. But one man - promoter Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there's something more to be investigated and the movie begins. This film does not deal with some exact theories, but it covers the entire relationship structure between government and society in today's world. Such a film could only be made in the 1970s, but it will never lose its relevance. Moreover, it is somewhat frightening how precise the oracles are. 10 out of 10.
