This, along with "Hare Tonic", is one of the best Bugs, actually one of the best Bugs of all time. There are some comments on how the Bugs in these cartoons are "basic", which means, I think, that it is not yet fully developed. I really prefer this "basic" version of the mid-1940s (Chuck Jones "was the best version) which actually is more rabbit-sized and much more fun than the long-legged version that towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of the classic Bugs and the classic Chuck Jones.
