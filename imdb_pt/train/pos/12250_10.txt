Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Angry! Too bad Knightly is not as handsome as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as father Emmas. I love the final scene (which is an addition to the novel - but well written) when the harvest is made and Knightly dines with his high society workers and friends. Emma must show that she accepts it now. She's a changed woman. This is too fast, but okay. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's former housekeeper and confidant. She's wonderful. just as I would have imagined it. I believe that when the UK does a Jane Austen it's the best. American versions of English literature are made for money, not quality. See this one here!
