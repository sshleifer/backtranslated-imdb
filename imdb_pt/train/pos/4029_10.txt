I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a real representation of the days of the partition. The film continued to haunt me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila played the role of her life in this film. She put life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in her role as Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone other than these two playing the role of Puroo and Rashid. The clothes of Punjabi seemed so natural in Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did a fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes you just can not get out of your head. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, this brings tears to his eyes. The climax is just killer. I was expecting a tragic ending, but fortunately, the ending was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. Not to be missed.
