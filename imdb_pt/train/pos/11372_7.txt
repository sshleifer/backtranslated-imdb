"Citizen X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov," nicknamed a hideous and perverse Russian serial killer who took 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on the rookie detective (Rea), who obstinately pursued the killer against all odds in the face of a non-cooperative bureaucracy in self-service and convenient denial. An HBO product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good performances, spares the public from much of the grisly details, but presents itself as a docudrama without the stylistics of similar Hollywood dishes. A straightforward, straightforward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little-known story, more interesting than "Jack the Ripper." (B)
