An underestimated addition to Graham Greene's cinematographic canon - his perceived failures can now be seen as virtues. Director Shumlin, theatrical director, frames his action with oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and seemingly inept compositions suggest convincingly discomfort. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 1940s thriller!), The film has a hero who goes crazy and murderous (and possibly pedophile), brilliantly brings the distant ideologies of the Spanish Civil War . to shake off dangerous reality, has a terrible murder, a startling view of class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approach to Greene's God, and an end that is only happy if you know nothing about history.
