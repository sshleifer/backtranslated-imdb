I've seen this movie for a while and it's still at the top of my list of 'favorite movies'. It's incredibly together and what really makes the movie are the detailed bits (like the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee box being reused as a cup to wash your grandchildren's hair) that people are not seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE A unless you are Hispanic. This is just one of those films that is culturally specific and particular. Please do not critique this movie if you have no prior knowledge of what basis it is being built. I completely see what the writer / director was going, and he hit the target perfectly! This movie is highly deserving of a better rating.
