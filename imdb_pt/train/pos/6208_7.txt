The 1997 indie drama, Henry Fool, apparently would have been a safe choice of films that no one would bother reviewing for a sequel. A rumpled and squandered homeless man (Thomas Jay Ryan) walks into town. His anarchist follies and illusions inspire a nerd collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems, while Henry tries to stimulate the boy's sister (Parker Posey). While the poet thrives, Henry declines. Nothing special about any of the characters or the story. A bid for Harold and Maude's Ghost would have been quoted with greater chances of reaching a screen. <br /> <br /> But Parker Posey is not the semi-official Queen of the Indies for nothing. So when writer / director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a movie was born. Although we have achieved the same characters for many years, they are in a completely different type of somber comedy; this one is tied with espionage! Henry may have been an international spy - and possibly a double agent, or even triple - for years before meeting the others. He is dead or hiding from agents and authorities in many countries. Everyone wants their disconnected and incoherent diary, which can contain only coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. Posey's Fay is the wife he left to go on the street, or his widow, depending on who's telling the truth. Fay's efforts to find Henry and / or the much-disputed periodicals include a glove of intriguers and henchmen in all directions. She never knows who to believe or trust. While joining these unlikely characters in Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan's territory, Hartley's script retains the ironic, expressionless humor of his first appearance, avoiding the clownhood of exposing them to physical threats. His shrewd glimmer of paranoia, duplicity, and musical chairs of today's geopolitics begins to crumble in the end. Even so, fans of the first film will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley's recycling methods. (05/18/07)
