Leave a Reply How is my review necessary? We are talking about all-time masterpiece, for all seasons and all generations. This is just the kind of movies that I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in the other Disney films, it's some kind of magic. All characters are somehow "alive" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message even if you do not understand the language (as I did not understand when I first saw the movie because I was about six years old of age) ). Maybe my English is not so good, but I learned what I know more about this type of film, and this is another big dimension of this type of film, which is rare today. But there is a great shame. In my country now it is impossible to watch this, or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyrights, so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this type of movie. So let's watch this movie again "Once upon a dream" or ...?
