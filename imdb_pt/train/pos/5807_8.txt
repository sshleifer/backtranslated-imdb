This is, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. It contains a message about drugs, stunning special effects and an incredible music video. <br /> <br /> The main movie is centered around music and the music video 'Smooth Criminal'. Unlike the four-minute video clip, it's normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather strange, however. Michael Jackson plays a magical 'gangster' who, when he sees a shooting star, he turns into a piece of machinery. Throughout the film, it turns into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The particular robot scene is somewhat extensive and strange. I found it a bit out of tune compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> A kid is kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. A little weird? Yes. <br /> <br /> But beyond the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie, and any Michael Jackson fan will like both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
