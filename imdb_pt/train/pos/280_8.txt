Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements about the weary genre of first person shooter. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, a occult specialist and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his property in Ireland to investigate some strange phainomena. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War, so do not expect to find weapons like the chainguns or rocket launchers. All game weapons can be considered antiques, but the real fun in the game is their spells and the system in which they operate. . Our hero is ambidextrous so he can use both hands at the same time: he conjures spells with his right arm and uses his weapons with his left. Then you can shoot and cast spells while you understand a lot of fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are great and can run nicely in a medium power design P.C..Level is also cool and atmospheric. Mostly the game revolves around the Covenant property and mansion, but there are plenty of other places waiting to be discovered as you go along. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker the game has an excellent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and I said before a great and very scary atmosphere the dubbing is also good but not great. But the game has two major flaws. First of all, it is quite linear, so when your mission says, for example, to go into that room all the house doors will be locked away from those that lead to the room of your mission, this can save time but restrict your freedom of exploration. Second, the fact that all weapons are antiques may not please most fps players who are accustomed to high-tech weapons. With regard to difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of it is medium difficulty, but sometimes it gets harder, but it's not frustratingly difficult. Overall, immortal is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
