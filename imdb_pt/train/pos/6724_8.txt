As a popular sport, surfing has been enjoyed by many people. Shortly after watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it could be. In fact, surfers were also afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed for it. But they kept surfing and having fun. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, we can clearly know what they felt when the great wave came to them. You have to adjust to your best and avoid a direct attack of the big wave. When you win, this will obviously bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Incredible cinematography can not be neglected. This is an absolutely visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 8/10
