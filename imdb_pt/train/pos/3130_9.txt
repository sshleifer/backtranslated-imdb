I am Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first ones I liked. Unfortunately over here caused a "panic hysteria" among the mothers because Batman was considered very violent. Jesus, compare the innocence of this series with the crap that children can see today. So, because of my super protective moms of the '60s, I just had the chance to see two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comic books and chewing gum (I still managed!) To make up for it. I even got the View Master slides ... I wanted to see the cover crusader. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally had the chance to see the reruns as teenagers and I enjoyed it tremendously. The ironic acting would have escaped me when I would have watched as a child, but I understood when I was 17 years old. Yes, I watched them all now and an occasional gentle soul on the internet posts. episodes because they did not release the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> Tonight I liked "Return to the bat cave" ... it was a delight to watch because it was full of curiosities and inside jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every way. They touch themselves as they play their parts in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "banquet" ... I'm going to watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE !!! For rent !!! Lend of a friend !!! Buy !!! I would never expect to rate this as 9/10 ... Very well done!
