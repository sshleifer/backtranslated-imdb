I first saw this film as a pre-teen, about the age when children begin to think about their identity. I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children he creates as his own. The older boy was insulted because his mother is a prostitute and none of his brothers have the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes clear by having children who do not look anything). The man still persuades the boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts. The man is acclaimed as father by all the children, but one, who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the stickers is equally appealing to their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not Kurosawa's biggest movie.
