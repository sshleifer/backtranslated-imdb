Hello everyone, all my names Larissa I'm 13 when I was about 4 years old I watch curly and he hit my socks I've been watching that movie for a long time actually about 30 minutes ago I just watched. Alisan Porter is a very good actor and I love this movie. It's so funny when she's dealing with the cards. Every time I watch that movie at the end of it I cry, I'm told I know I'm only 13 years old, but it's such a moving story that it's really weird that Alisan is 25 now. Every time I watch a movie, someone is always young and the movie comes out as a year after they do and when you watch and find out how old the person in the movie really is injured as they can go from an era to the another nearby. Like Harry Potter. This movie was great too, but still Daniel was about 12 years old in the first film and I was about 11 years old. So how could he go from 12 to 16 years in about 4 years and I'm only 13 years old? it's 16 now I think it's almost 18 but this is kind of weird when you look at a movie and the next there are about 4 years then u when they were only 1 at last. I'm not sure if I have one big imagination and I like to insult him.I am a kind of computer person, but I like to do a lot of children's things too. I'm very clever like the curly process in the movie but one thing I do not like about the movie is when the guy calls the foster home and makes the curly be taken off I would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life. Well, I'll stop writing, I know how to write a lot, sometimes, but kids have a lot of stuff in there, they need to get out, and if they do not, children will never learn. Larissa
