Who said horror was not a genre of educational film, eh? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short film, at least now I NEVER know how to offer a strange visitor wine and a slice of salt bread in my own home because it can be a hypnotist and this combination will give me the power to control my life. thoughts and mind forever! Thank you hammer! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one I was anxious to see, especially since the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the best filmmakers in Britain, but still sadly underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some really cool films, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex but fascinating plot outline that revolves around delightful occult themes. The plot focuses on two antique dealers who come across a strange object resembling a mirror, but it is actually an ancient device that can be used to summon Choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is strongly desired by a satanic cult, since they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. When he catches a clearly petrified girl who is fleeing the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is taken even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical topics of British terror, but David Fischer's script is never monotonous and offers many well-defined scenarios, including a highly inventive climax. There is also a lot of tension to admire, the dialogues are clever and the performances are splendid (especially John Carson as the cult leader is genuinely sinister). Recommended!
