The music of Albeniz permeates this film. From time to time it is played with original instrumentation (eg piano, but never full orchestra), but is often re-worked with several contemporary ensembles (eg guitar) and treatments (eg jazz piano). Only occasionally is music the sole focus of the film: most of the time the music is tuned to various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I would say that there are 12 14 14 scenes, which are not joined by a plot. Not all scenes reach the heights of an individual viewer. In my case, almost half reached the peak, although everything else was very well in its own way. Those who worked for me led me to an aesthetic pleasure of goose meat; in fact, the final scene left me tearful with joy. And in a very magical way, this takes you to the Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is practically speechless, although each scene has a title from a work by Albeniz. Seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of Saura's movies is available on DVD in the US. I am thinking particularly here of his flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular work of art that is available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs do not play on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
