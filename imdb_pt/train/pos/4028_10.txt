I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who posted here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood movies and I was born and raised in the USA. So I do not have a broad base to compare Pinjar with other Indian movies. Fortunately, no comparison is necessary. <br /> <br /> Pinjar is by itself as nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In a line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important. movies to leave any studio anywhere at any time. On a mass appeal scale, it could have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" had it been properly promoted in the US. This could very well have been the film that put Bollywood on the American map. The American movie audience has a longstanding love affair with "Gone With the Wind," and although Pinjar does not borrow from this plot, there are some transient similarities. No less than whopping (by US standards) is 183 minutes of runtime. Defining against the gritty backdrop of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and pushed into trouble she had no share in creation. Placed in an unsustainable position, it somehow manages not only to survive, but to grow - and even to flourish. <br /> <br /> If history is missing in any way, it's on display. The growth of Puro (the protagonist) as a person would be better illustrated - at least for Western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture - if his character's "background story" was more developed early in the film. But that would have stretched a movie from 3 hours to 3 Â½ hours or maybe even longer. Because not a minute of the movie is wasted, and nothing that came out of the issue could actually be cut because of the time. It's better that the audience have to fill in some of what came before they leave out what's left. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "pungent," "disturbing," "convincing," "heart-wrenching" comes to mind immediately. But "edifying" may be just as appropriate as any of these. Any story that points to the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst odds must be regarded as such. And Puro's triumph-though not possibly immediately apparent to those around him-is nothing short of inspiring. Just by the force of the story I can not recommend this movie enough. <br /> <br /> Equally inspiring is Urmila Matondkar's portrait of Pure. Often neglected among the younger and younger group of actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to present a completely dependable character in whatever role she plays. It does not only act as Pure, it gives life to the character. Manoj Bajpai's selection as Rashid was inspired. He manages something that very few heroes of Indian movies can: subtlety. Your command of expression and nuance is essential to the role. He brings more threat to the early part of the film with his penetrating gaze than all the troublemakers wielding swords. <br /> <br /> If you see only one Bollywood movie in your life, do it Pinjar.
