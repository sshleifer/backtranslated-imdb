All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated children's movie like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all prominent in the plot, and although kids have very little, adults will be scratching their heads about why this movie was made to look like some kind of gangster movie. The film itself is not explicit at all, it's just a weird combination to make a child's movie. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a dog player, who owns half a casino with his partner. Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (a dog ... getting drunk ... in a child's movie. It sounds strange), Charlie is cheated and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven he finds a way to return to earth, but he will no longer be permitted in heaven. He still returns to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy (Don Deluise), and plans a return on Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little girl orphan, Anne Marie, held captive because of her incredible ability to talk to all kinds of animals, which helps predict the breeds. Charlie and Itchy release her, and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few that are not Disney and attracts children and adults. Kids will love the funny characters and lively animation, while the adults will enjoy the nice and sweet plot, and the characters developed more than normal. One thing that keeps it down is that it's a musical. Usually, this is a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump, almost sounding ad libted, with almost no instrumental support. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but fortunately, the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart because of some bad notes. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad but happy, but sadder than happy, and makes the film look like it needs a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel was made for it, I wish the ending would not have guaranteed a sequel and would have ended in a happy and super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel like this, but I do. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great family movie, with weird themes, but still good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 85 min.
