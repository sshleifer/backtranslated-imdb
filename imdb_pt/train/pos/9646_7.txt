There is certainly excitement between the two main characters as they explore their relationship - one primarily based on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also thrill in the inner workings of Mathieu's family, which deals with their mother's problems - and how that affects their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless I'm too dumb to get them). Why is Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? What led to the boys breaking up? And the lightning between the present and the past is a little difficult to follow at the beginning. It seems the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some vicarious homoerotic emotions, or some masculine nudity. But as a love story or character study, this is unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory.
