9 / 10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not so scary. But it sure is fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Guardian (John Kassir) tells a FEAR holiday tale, giving us all Christmas Goose ... GosseBUMPS That's right. Bwahahahahha You should really be careful what you AX Santa. Have a scary Christmas and a new happy fear. Okay, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Okay, so in history, a greedy wife (Best Screamer in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the trainer who gets whipped to death in YEARS 2) by money. BUT, her plan is ruined when a wacky killer dressed in a Santa costume (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) comes toward you. <br /> <br /> If you search YouTube, you can watch for free, but most of you have seen it (my third view). But if you did not see it, I suggest you do it.
