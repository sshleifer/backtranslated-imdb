This movie is the best movie of all time. I can not remember the last time a movie brought tears to me. With a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie should have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, story / plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street actress famous for The King of Masks and a little girl who sold as a boy in a servant's market. Little girl liked to be her granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson. They were not conventional in real. Every scene they were together was invaluable. The camera work is flawless and arrests you. The acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of the masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks beautiful and played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his handy and good-natured character extremely well. If you do not have this movie, try it once, watch.
