I loved this movie It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider movies. This is a rock, not as big as Sissi, but it's still a rock! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said dubbing in French. Well, this is originally a German non French film. So yes. Second of all there was a plot, perhaps you are not familiar with the story. Oh, and her mother played the housekeeper, not the teacher. And the story was not Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, you may have lost that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway ... yes, the history of this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all things historical. Like that guy who was trying to manipulate his mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. When the dance was new, it was considered scandalous because the couples danced so close. Yes, your housekeeper was like oh my god! <br /> <br /> And also the clothes, I love the clothes. The styles are great, hoop skirts are awesome. And, of course, Romy always looks very pretty.
