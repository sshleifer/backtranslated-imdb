Another powerful girl movie. This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman, who is always getting into fights at school. Instead of being expelled, she takes her anger elsewhere, to the boxing ring. She trains to be a boxer and there she meets Adrian feather and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a powerful message to catch your dreams and go with them, even if someone does not believe you (in this case, your father does not believe in it). That alone makes the movie worth the price. Appreciate
