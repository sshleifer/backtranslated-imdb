Although most Americans have little knowledge of their work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an incredible body of work-particularly in the 1940s-1950s-ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love their comedies, since they are so well made and look so natural and real on the screen - very different from Hollywood cuisine. <br /> <br /> That said, this was the movie that sparked my interest in these films. The plot was so weird and cute that it's very unlikely the movie was made anywhere - except at Ealing Studios - which had a special taste for "little" movies like that. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a small nerd scientist who works for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, although he does not work for the company as a researcher, but for janitorial work! So he tends to infiltrate the labs (be it during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try to invent. Repeatedly, he gets caught (like after he blew up the lab) and gave the boot until one day he actually succeeds! So, despite the importance of the discovery, it unleashes a completely unpredictable chain of events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful satire that mocks industry, unions, government. and people in general.
