I had fun watching Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well-directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect on paper. Yes, it's the same old story with a different scenario, but Wes Craven gave a good rhythm. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's cool to see a clean and consistent thriller, even when originality does not stand out as the main character. Particularly from a filmmaker like Craven who has brought so many groundbreaking ideas to the genre thriller and horror in the past and now lends itself to taking home what might have been a good TV movie had it not been released in theaters. Good job!
