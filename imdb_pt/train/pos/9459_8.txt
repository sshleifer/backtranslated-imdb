I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, as romantic comedies feature old cliches that make the movie uninteresting. Usually, in a Romantic Comedy, there's a girl and a guy, they both fall in love, then they get into trouble and then they get over their marriages or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There's a widowed guy (Dan), there's a girl (Marie). Dan finds Marie at a bookstore and speaks for some time, after some time Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when that begins to become significant, we have a turnaround. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Without knowing the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not only be possible. How this is possible, forms the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell has a good performance, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And all other things are well done. It's a good movie, watch it.
