I came to this show late - I believe it was the third and final episode when I first watched - and was surprised by a social commentary that has not been seen on American TV since 'All in the Family'. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that CBS would even enforce this in the first place. <br /> <br /> That's just to say that the last time CBS 'had a set' - if you know what I mean - was back in 'All in the Family' day. The most controversial decision that they are willing to face today is how much eye makeup to put on Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people really crazy - let them discover truth about themselves. And if you want them to be willing to pull strings, make connections, and take art work - let them discover that truth by listening to their own spoken words from their own mouths. <br /> <br /> The Aardman people have always been way ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. Somehow he sneaked under the CBS corporate / social / political / censor radar to put it on schedule (maybe the 'big brass' never actually watched until it finally aired), but once they turned up being themselves - well, they can bet on the farm that this message, or the messenger, will not last long. <br /> <br /> Now if only the 'lost episodes' can find their way in Usenet or bits. torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
