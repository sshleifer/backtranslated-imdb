"The United States of Kiss My Ass' House of Games is the directional debut of playwright David Mamet and is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller.It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to face the player who led one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so, she leaves behind the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life and travels through the center to visit the low-life place , House of Games. <br /> <br /> The player Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) To be a bit sharp and naughty. <br /> <br /> He offers Crouse's character if she is willing to sit with him in a game, a big money game in the back room, it will clear the debts of the patients. The card game follows and soon the psychiatrist and the player are seen in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential vision for any movie fan is the constant guessing of whoever is in control, is the psychiatrist or con-man or is the man known to big bluffs David Mamet. In the House of Games the direction is monotonous and most of the time flat and uninspired, however, in all of David Mamet's films it is the story that is central to the whole process, not the direction. In House of Games this shines in part thanks to the superb performances of the two protagonists (showy and disturbing), but mainly as is the case for much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue that holds you and slowly attracts you to the film. . No one in the Game House says what they mean and talks become battlefields and word warfare. All bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a natural order of poker games. This is a recurring theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create large amounts of tension. House of Games can also be seen as a "class war" split movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class psychiatrist, rich and educated, and Joe Mantegna is the opposite, the working class of America making a living with an "honest" crime. <br /> <br /> The movie seduces the viewer is very much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for everyone to see and be aware of, it's impressive. <br /> <br /> An extremely enjoyable cinematic experience that is worth seeing repeated views. 9/10
