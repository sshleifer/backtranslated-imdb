Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, offers martial arts action kicking high in spades in this thrilling Hong Kong movie and proves that as her late brother Brandon she is a real plug of the old block. There's a high tech stunt to die for in this fast-paced movie, and the creators of Bond films should take a look if they want to increase the action quotient of the upcoming 007 adventure, as there are many groundbreaking things here with some new features and second-unit work original to reinforce the already high action content of "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEAD". When you watch a movie as fast and fun as this, you begin to wonder how filmmaking itself survived before the martial arts genre was created. I genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular mark the time to the first. kung fu movies made their debut. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action film and his surviving legitimate daughter, Shannon, does not leave the family name here. While there are several enjoyable presentations in this film (Michel Wong, for example), it is from Shannon Lee that you will remember a genuine story. spectacular performance as Mandy the supreme hitgirl. Well, you might as well go whistling your fights!
