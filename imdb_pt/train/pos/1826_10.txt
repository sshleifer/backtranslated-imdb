I loved this movie when I was little. Today, at 17, it's one of my favorite animated films of all time. Lovely animation and engaging characters are just two of the things you like in this movie. Although many people do not like some of the songs, most of them are well made and follow the story. He focuses on Charlie, a handsome German Shepard who may seem nasty to some at first ... but eventually will conquer him. <br /> <br /> It's not a kid's movie at all. Often very dark and scary at times. A treat for fans of Don Bluth and animation fans. But keep a fabric handy. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to movies. Indisputably one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A heavenly masterpiece.
