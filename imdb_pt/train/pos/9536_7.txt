Crazy and graphically bloody Japanese movie about small beings taking people and turning them into necroborg-zombie-like machines - that beat and cut each other so the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of that, a couple of lovers are infected. <br /> <br /> The technically superb horror comedy (?) is only for those with strong stomachs while blood and body parts fly. Good taste keeps me from describing what happens here, but let's just say it's very awful. If you like this kind of thing with several steps way above slim content by all means, watch this movie. Personally I'm not usually one to like movies like this on anything but how sick and twisted they go flushed. Here I was intrigued enough to be able to suggest to people I know who like really bloody movies. It's also a movie with enough going on in the details that I want to see again from now on that I know what was going on. revealed at the end, I want to go back and see what it was that I did not understand. There is a rare inner logic in these films. <br /> 7 out of 10 for those who love blood and severed limbs, it is a zero or more precisely a race and an alert for everyone else.
