This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series is less accurate than the American series, but this time the authors hit the right target, creating a mix that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, has it all: great plot, clever, witty, always well delivered lines, an incredible theatrical time shown by all the stars and beautiful pictures of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It's fun to see how things work in the field of justice in countries other than the US and for once "feel" the old way of dealing with life in Europe. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for a well made comedy that will be a must see for years to come. Watching the series in German is super.
