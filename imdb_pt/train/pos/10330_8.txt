This is actually a trilogy of 3 short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes away and is very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is fired from his church work because he can not read or write. So, what does he do? Open a tobacconist, of course! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, which was actually a story I'd read to school six years ago and instantly forgotten, until I heard the familiar introduction. Plus 15 minutes, and also very good. It worked better in the movie than in a book for me, but maybe it's because I was only 14 years old the last time, after all. <br /> <br /> The third is almost a disappointment. Almost an hour or so, it just crawls. It's not so bad, but not as fast and agile as the last two. I watched his first quarter of an hour and then jumped into the last quarter of an hour and thought it still made sense and I really had not missed a thing! <br /> <br /> In general I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
