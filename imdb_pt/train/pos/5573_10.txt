A MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED in a press release and it was hilarious. We're talking about laughter non-stop. This makes SOMETHING seem like a sinuous drama. Amanda Peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty, intelligence and serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, the director, made a cutting-edge film that shows the essence of male egos in the world of urban encounters. For all this is comedy, Whipped succeeds with his intelligence. That is so rare for a director for the first time, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber complete the cast with depth and very strong performances, such as the smartest men. You have to watch these guys go to work and get caught up on Peet's website. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth downloading for 3 minutes.
