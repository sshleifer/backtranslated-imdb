I saw this movie at a time when I was shyly playing around with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that's the reason I took it so seriously. I fully believed in the psychological degradation of the poor character within a Paris of perpetual constructions, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, malice, and decadence. I'm giving all credence to Polanski's talent for his direction, his playing, and his inescapable script, but I fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the theater impresario's office. Fortunately for me, my life alone has not become as disastrous as this (until now), but I have always maintained a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and thus immerse himself in the (false) reality of him. is trying to convey. Simply put, man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This movie is the sum of many, many examples of great acting and great cast. As some presentations were made in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most of the other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I highly recommend, if you are bilingual, to switch audio from French to English and vice versa during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent download on the Paramount DVD. This film is part of the so-called "apartment building trilogy" by Polanski, which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet reached a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Needless to say, the three films would make a great boxset.
