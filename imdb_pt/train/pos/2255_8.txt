Not a bad martial arts movie. The fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without foul language and a lot of blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good story line that works. It would be great to see something different from her in the same genre. She likes the art and have strong promenant women. It was definitely worth seeing. I recommend the movie for all lovers of drama and martial arts.
