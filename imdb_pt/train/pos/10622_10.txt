"Hate of a Minute" is a frighteningly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a "must see" for any film student or horror fan. The realism of Eric's story and human side separate this film from other psycho killer films. A few shouts for the producer of the film, Bruce Campbell as well as for the movie "The Evil Dead" add some humor to those who know the genre.
