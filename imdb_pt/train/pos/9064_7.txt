I sat with my kids while we watched this movie. We all thought it was a really fun movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth-grader starts working with him and that's what leads to the consumption of worms. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy has so much time to eat 10 worms or more. From this point, the bully and his friends try to find nasty ways to cook, fry or roast the worms to try to make Billy sick so he loses the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to become liked more and more by everyone, even bullies friends. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you just need to watch it to find out, but I will think that if you like good movies for the family, you will like it of this. <br /> <br /> Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all the daughters and they really liked it very much.
