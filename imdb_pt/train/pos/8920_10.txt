I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I just knew that I was extremely scared to see this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Trantula" at age seven ... but I was ten now). The first scene in which the Bubble crawls over the farmer's staff and swallows his hand is enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered from each of our monster's attacks. I felt so horrified when Steve and his girlfriend barely left the doctor's office (poor doctor), and even more so when The Blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large part of the audience. . . In fact, many people left the front door, too big now to go through just one. He seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when he'd arrested poor Steve in a diner, it felt like a safe dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that the Blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end, better than scaring and mentally ripping small children. <br /> <br /> I remember walking home with my Uncle Nick at night, trying to act brave. He knew I was in trouble, and when I went to bed that night, I could not just feel the bubble in the room, but when I invented the courage to look at the floor, there the red face pulsating, hungry heart She sat up, waiting for me to try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I'm 57 now. . . I made it. <br /> <br /> Of course Blob was not destroyed.
