This beautiful story of an older son returning home, and learning to love and to be a part of all those things that he left home to escape, is poignant and moving. This shows a society that may be strange to us in the Western world, with a sense of family we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and comical. It has a sense of realism that we do not seem to see in our Western movies anymore. <br /> <br /> The acting is uncommon as the film progresses, it almost gives the impression that it is not acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. That's brilliant direction and making movies. <br /> <br /> I would love to see more of this director's films.
