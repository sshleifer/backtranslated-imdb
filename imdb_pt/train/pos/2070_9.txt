Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow deliver first-class performances in their respective roles; Phillips has a somewhat less enviable task of trying to spice up a TV movie (twenty-five years ago), providing "sexual interest" in a sexless movie. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; a 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, placed before a camera and given a workout that will leave the spectator panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat in anticipation panting. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are spectacular (although some dialogues are a bit stupid) contributing to the fun of a good night. That's how all "car movies" should be made. <br /> <br /> Try to get this on the movie channel; it's worth the lost sleep.
