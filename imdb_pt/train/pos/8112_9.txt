Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells create this extraordinary film of anticipation, with ambition and scope difficult to find today. They predicted World War II and how Britain was attacked, as well as the fact that war would be followed by a space race. They change the time; in the movie, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many things that are qualitatively correct that is incredible. We even see a helicopter (the movie is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists who look like Romans with bubble helmets: if you can see through these funny costumes you can appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters of the thirties, vision Well of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, one who chooses to shape reality and not be shaped by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspiring like that final monologue of John Cabal.
