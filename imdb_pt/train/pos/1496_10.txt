I enjoyed catching this movie too late at the end of the TV and it kept my interest through the whole picture. This wonderful, creepy yet mysterious English home with malicious decorations and furniture and strange rooms make you wonder why anyone would want to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) tales about this house, and every resident of the house encounters all sorts of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house and also the sweet song of the birds, but do not let that fool you, there is horror all over the place. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", "80 gives a great performance as one of the people who live at home and even Christopher Lee," Curse of the Crimson Altar ", 68 and his little girl, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid) If you like freaky, horrifying and mysterious movies with lots of surprises, this is the MOVIE FOR YOU !!!!
