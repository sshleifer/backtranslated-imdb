An ordinary film well done, with a tragic ending. Advantages: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live, followed by a long flashback on why she is there. The music. A disinterested look at the life of the police. Minuses: Violence and blood, but I think they increase the realistic effects. Still, having people's heads cut and shipped in boxes and bags could have been avoided. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
