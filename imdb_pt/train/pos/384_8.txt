The film version of Alice Walker's highly emotional and influential 1983 novel (written largely as Celie to God central character cards) was a huge Oscar success, and rightfully so. <br /> <br /> In the role of the abused and Celie awake, Whoopi Goldberg gave his best screen performance for miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sophie, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast exhibited the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's violent husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force of change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the pastor's wife; and the late Carl Anderson (better known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as preacher Samuel. Beautifully stimulated and sensitive, 'The Color Purple' does justice to its source as it opens the story to engage viewers in a feature-length drama.
