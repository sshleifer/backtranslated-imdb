The only explanation I can give about why this movie is not widely distributed is because it gets too close to home for some. This movie was a real happy surprise, the satire is great. This movie turns on the lights in the dark that is organized religion and the big media, and cockroaches rush to hide. Rent the DVD and watch yourself if you have not already done so, this movie succeeds where many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) stick your nose under the tent, using humor and very intelligent analogies, and tell scenarios and locations. I can not comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this movie that even the seasoned moviegoer will be taken by surprise.
