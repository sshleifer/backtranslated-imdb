Kurt Russell is Elvis, pure and simple. His dedication to that role resulted in what I think is the best movie biography of all time. If you are an Elvis fan, see if you can. <br /> <br /> The movie made for television was made two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> Advice There are two versions - one in 180 minutes and another in 117 minutes. The only one to watch is the longest. The shorter has more than an hour of edited footage. It simply does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that have been cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis' childhood through his emergence as the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's true father) are excellent as Elvis parents. And Pat Hingle offers a very competent Colonel, Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the King!
