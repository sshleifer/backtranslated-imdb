It was in 1988, when I first saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" (on Austrian television). At that time, I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since winning the bronze rose at the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded each show on tape and watched it again and again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie was in front of a painting of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself, "I need a shave." Or more fun of all, when he played ball with your dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It's a shame, that Spitting Image seems to fall by the wayside; was one of the most fantastic and intelligent TV shows ever made. Compared to other satirical broadcasts, it was definitely the best of them all. <br /> <br /> Well, almost 20 years have passed since then, and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
