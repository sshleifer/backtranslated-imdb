Caught this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I was not expecting much (although the festival director told me it was one of the best films ever presented). Five minutes later, I was sold. Shot on B & W on a tight budget, this movie is hilarious. The acting is solid, the writing is solid and the film's appearance is solid. The acting is probably the biggest revelation, since most low budget movies tend to perform amateur or stage. Not this one. It features one of the most compelling, catchy and funny portraits of a character with Tourette Syndrome that I have ever seen. The plot is complicated without being confusing and cheeky without being gratuitous. If you get the chance, check out this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hopefully I got it right) deserve the chance to get their stuff out to a wider audience.
