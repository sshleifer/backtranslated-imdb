I usually think Loretta Young is hard to handle, very worried about her appearance and the appearance of a ladylike in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical novel by Frank Borzage, and despite playing a low self-esteem patsy facing a lot of bullying from lover Spencer Tracy, she is straightforward, honest and irresistible. It's a weird little movie, played mostly in a one-bedroom cabin in a Hooverville, unusually early on the Depression, yet romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a noisy, hard-to-accept "common guy," who would be a terrible chauvinist and intimidating by current standards, softens his character's character and almost makes him attractive. There is good support work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who have never gotten as far as they should), and Jo Swerling's script is modest and efficient. But the true heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-ups, and Young. You kind of want to slap her and tell your character to be smart, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and persuasive, you watch with satisfaction as their story comes to a satisfying conclusion.
