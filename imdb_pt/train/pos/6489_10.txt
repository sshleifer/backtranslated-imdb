I watched the show when it first came out in the 70's. I was 14 and I attended my best friends home, because my dad did not want to watch it. It became a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as anyone telling them two children of fourteen to watch a documentary in almost reverent silence should mean that it was something special. <br /> <br /> The wide coverage of World War II events makes it difficult to document. the creators divided it into what they considered to be the most important key events and dedicated an episode to each of them. Some episodes covered long periods, such as the "pack of wolves," which covered almost all six years of the Atlantic battle. of Stalingrad had an episode for himself. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be done today, simply because most of the interviewees are dead. The list of important players that appear gives an amazing insight into the thinking of the time. Anthony Eden, Foreign Minister Carl Donnitz, The u-boat speaker, Albert Speer, confident architect and then Hitler's arms minister. In one of the last episodes, we see Traudljunge, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker and it was with her that he dictated his last will and testament, she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped through the Russian lines. These and many others play an important role in the realism of the events portrayed. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the series is that the bletchly park decoders are not included, but the revelations of its part in the war only came up after the series was made, so I can not blame the creators from the program. <br /> <br /> The opening titles and music is magnificent, and Lawrence Olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script. <br /> <br /> The best documentary series ever made? without a doubt.
