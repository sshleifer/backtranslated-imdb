SPOILER MINOR <br /> <br /> Stephen King's little highlight. Not perfect, at any stretch of the imagination - even if the performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there would still be elements of the mismanaged mystical story to deal with. The old cemetery Micmac, Rachel's sick sister, and Jacob-Marley - a Victor Pascow - never get together in anything coherent, and the film in places seems confused and overblown. But few horror films are really perfect, and what this may lack in other areas pays off in its willingness to collide. "Pet Sematary" may actually be one of the most egregious horror movies in recent history, with its zombie killer baby and its insane retraction of Zelda. It's politically incorrect, it's in bad taste, it's free - and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way that "safer" horror movies can never. Add to this one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and the witty direction of Mary Lambert, and you will have an intensely satisfying horror film - even with the dark end. Highly recommended for fans of genre. 7.5 of 10.
