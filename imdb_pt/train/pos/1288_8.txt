Preston Waters is out of a bad summer. Besides his coming birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First he has to share his own room with his brothers who will run a business. They can not do this in their rooms because they do not have enough space. At a birthday party, he gets only $ 6 chips, while others receive $ 32, $ 35 and up to $ 50. When one of his birthday cards arrives early, he gets only a check for $ 11. <br /> Going to the bank, he finds that he needs at least $ 200 to start an account. Leaving the bank, a bully steals the check. Chasing after the boy almost makes him run over (his bike is definitely ruined) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley has just come from the bank also to give the owner $ 1 million to give to this guy tomorrow. Quigley begins writing a check for damage, but can only write his name before a police car circulates the area. Afraid, he gives the check to Preston, informs him to give his father to finish. <br /> <br /> That night, Preston tells his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants his own back room, even better his own home. His father confines him to his room for the rest of the night. Lamenting in his bedroom Preston thinks things can not get worse, he realizes he forgot the check as it is still in his shirt pocket. It is blank. <br /> <br /> Using the computer and after careful analysis, it earns $ 1,000,000. The next day, while trying to cash it in the bank, he was taken to the owner who thinks he is the person he should give $ 1 million and wins. He's not like the real person called Juice comes in a moment later. <br /> <br /> Now the three have to track down Preston. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston has fun buying all sorts of things. including his own home and even going on dates with a disguised bank lady who is really an FBI agent (who is trying to track down the 3 thieves). He makes that person appoint Mr. Macintosh to whom he works and even plans a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But eventually things reach (money runs out, bad guys catch it). <br /> <br /> Overall, a really funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his very good role. If you liked it in Another Stakeout, you'll love it here. He does all sorts of crazy and crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the stressed boss of Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful friendly driver in this movie.
