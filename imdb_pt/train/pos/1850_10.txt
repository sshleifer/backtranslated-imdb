This is my favorite movie. I've watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family begs me not to watch, so I will not have a crying attack. I think I love it being a true story written by Antwone himself as much as I love the movie. The acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he's made so far. I took care of a boy who was also born in jail. He was the most precious boy I ever knew. He was now adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie while the fight was still going on and its future was uncertain and I'm so happy that it's safe and loved. And I'm so happy that Antwone is happy and has found her family. <br /> <br /> I would love to know more about him and how he has been since he met his family. I just can not say enough good things about it !!
