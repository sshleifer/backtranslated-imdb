We are tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as a "thought event" following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal plot is the tantalizing quest of Bart Klever for the ephemeral substance that constitutes the essence of personality. The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and his own imagination. This monologue film originated as a response to Fellini's 8Â½ and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Animatedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the public reveals the extravagant interconnection between the real and the imaginary, the paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: Guttenberg's and MacLhuen's. For a while we are able to stand on the side of the screenwriter, who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damn stereotypes of the mass mentality ("man," "catholic," "window washer"). And along with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator finally comes across the insoluble dilemma: how can we eliminate the future film? Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the end, thanks to the petty accusations of the creator's wife, who is deeply immersed in the work, we realized that along with the main character, we were again framed. Indeed, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the daily care of the young daughter? <br /> <br /> So, who is he, this Bart? Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed as Frenhoffer of Balzac's masterpiece (as well as the last, the writer in the end erases from the memory of the computer everything that was written)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we ourselves should respond to this question. <br /> <br />
