To have a friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. Of course the SOB is very handsome, charming, etc. and my friend is a very smart woman. Seeing Jean Pierre Leaud's character at work is just like seeing what goes on in real life, when guys like that destroy the lives of our friends. It's tragic, and you know she's going to end up badly hurt, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty A blank space, he pulls the faces and tells the stories that he thinks will have the reaction he wants. <br /> <br /> The scene in which two hours when Leaud and Lebrun made love, and the next morning he puts a record and, very sweetly and charmingly, sings together to amuse her is brilliant. The expression "What the hell am I doing here with that idiot" that flickers from side to side on your face will be in my memory for a long time? <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but watch it at once, preferably in a movie theater. It takes time to get in, but time just disappears.
