I liked almost every movie in the Dirty Harry series, except for what I think is entitled "Enforcer." "Deadpool" was a little weak in the areas too, but I still liked it. This is one of my favorites in the series, if nothing else for the big line of "Go ahead, make my day". This also presents an interesting, though familiar, plot of someone killing those who have done evil. Just think of "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the murders and you have your plot. Granted there is a little more than that, as this presents a very good final showdown at an amusement park. He also features Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a present and stumbling on Sandra Locke in a humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of her films. It brings the punctuation down one point at a time, even when in general the movie is pleasing to me. Granted she is not evil here, but her character could have been much better by someone else. Another problem with this film and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes they almost seem to be arms advertisements. I like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes from him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets does it contain? Still, very good entry into the Dirty Harry movie series.
