It must be a joke around Bonanza about how it was fatal for any woman to get involved with any Cartwright man. After all, Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a child at every marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe would die because we could not get rid of the formula of the widower and the three children who started this Western TV classic. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Bonanza were being made today, the writers would have had characters from rotating women who got in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some are good, others are not so good, they are just life. And we're less picky about our heroes today, so if a relationship with one of them goes south, we will not have to kill the character to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were made today. <br /> <br /> But we were still expecting a lot from our Western heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while to get a hold and a change in NBC's viewing time certainly helped, the secret. The success of Bonanza was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his faithful children. Ben Cartwright was the father of the ideal TV in any genre that you wanted to name. All his life was spent in the arduous work of building that immense Ponderosa spread by his three children. The children were all different in personality, but all came together in a squeeze. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights have become and still are an American institution. I would say that more people cared for this family than did the Kennedys. Only the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication attests that. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as the eldest son Adam was written off the show. Rumor has it that he did not care for the noble characters of Cartwright, whom he considered bordered by hypocrisy. Maybe if it was done now, he would have liked it better the way I describe it. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three successful programs on their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, hottest, but most romantic of the Cartwright. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. The show continued with the two young children, but when the great Dan Blocker left, the heart left Bonanza. Other characters had been added at the time, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted the young Mitch Vogel. But the big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the kindest of the Cartwright. His sudden death after surgery left a very large hole in that family. <br /> <br /> So the Ponderosa Cartwrights have gone down in history. I have a real taste of how the United States took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited true Virginia City. It does not look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, almost where you see the Ponderosa on the map in the opening credits, is the Cartwright House, the set maintained and opened as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwright are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should have been.
