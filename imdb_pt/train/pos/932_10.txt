********* Ten of the Ten Stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe this was made for the television movie. Only the phrase "made of TV" makes me shudder. The production values ​​for TV movies are almost always remarkably lower than the production values ​​for professional film studios. That said, this version of "Christmas Carol" should have been released in theaters because it is so good. It's my favorite of all the "Christmas Carol" movies because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor flaws on the screen with two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there is not a movie that does not have at least some errors. Scott becomes a stellar performance like Scrooge, he's a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can not think of a performance in this movie that should not be applauded. The costumes, the shooting location and the winter scenery are fascinating. The musical score is captivating and moving. Add to that, solid direction, flawless cinematography and faithful scripts; we have here what will one day be considered a classic vacation. Really there is not enough time to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon will be. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas: love, self-denial, and giving. In a selfish and greedy world, my family and I can get lost in "The Christmas Carol," starring George C. Scott.
