Holes is an incredible movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It is one of the few films produced by Disney that is not tacky. Holes is usually a really cool movie. I wanted Disney to take more pictures like that. Holes is in fact a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not want to say that Disney is bad, but most things are geared towards children and that's okay. Children deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney has been guilty of trying to attract the teen crowd and they usually fail. But not with holes. It's the kind of movie that anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and even think it's cheesy. Actually, it's the kind of movie that many young henchmen can enjoy, since there are characters they can relate to. <br /> <br /> Holes does a good job at being a mix of family entertainment not being too tacky and living a bit on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes darker movies like this.
