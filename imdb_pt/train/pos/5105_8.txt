How can one argue that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best document of Texas life for the period of time. Consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk at night bars, get married to settle a fight, commit adultery, and compete in mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that portrays real life so vividly. They do not make them anymore. It seems that the current films are always about people with a lot of money, live in huge houses, drive expensive cars and do not work. This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for the love of God! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watch at least once a week. No joking. I have dissected this movie from end to end. feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are split - he speaks amicably to the horns and waves, she turns the bird towards him - he returns half the peace sign honking to add impact and then weep. <br /> <br /> Mom calls Buds approx. 18 hours after he arrives in town on a Sunday to see if he has a job yet - all he got was getting drunk and lying down (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt who cover him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs" Think why this scene is necessary. Think about it. It was necessary? Could not we figure it out without showing the filthy sink? God I love it! <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes just kicked her fucking husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yeah, you did not hit my husband the other night, so let's start this lesson, not to mention the fact that she seeks solace in him later during Bud and Sissy's many fights, by the way, all of which happen in public - in Gilley's! <br /> <br /> The wedding reception photoshoot (oh mankind!) could at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. "My legs are sweating mommy." In conclusion, you do not put such scenes in a movie to try to show a vision of human psychology. It's a real-life documentary. <br /> <br /> I just wish there was a cut of the director ...
