The story is extremely unique. It's about these 2 pilots saving the Earth from alien beings, but they have to use a special speed that causes everything around them to age quickly. The whole series is about pilots dealing with wasting time , friends and mentors. <br /> <br /> The end COULD have been fantastic. It began to end on a full note and left a real mark but ended with a super happy Disney note and it bothered me VERY bad. <br /> <br /> The animation is decent for 89 but can not be compared to nowadays. I also heard many complain about the nudity of nudity. I actually thought it was a bit decent. Nudity for the most part justified, except in episode 2 where there was an excess. <br /> <br /> Overall, it deserves a look, but the ending prevents it from being a classic.
