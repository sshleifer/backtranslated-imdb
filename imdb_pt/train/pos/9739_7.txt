I had fun watching this movie, mainly due to Simon Pegg, which quickly became a blockbuster for comedy movies. <br /> <br /> He is hired in London by Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrity rags. <br /> <br /> After paying his debts, he enters the highest celebrity step he writes hackdom (the "seventh room"), where he manages to be a minor celebrity himself. The plot is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutting advertising agent. <br /> <br /> Along the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <br /> The formidable plot aside, the film was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg , Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. The rest of the support cast did its job well. <br /> <br /> This was a good comedy and worth checking out in theaters.
