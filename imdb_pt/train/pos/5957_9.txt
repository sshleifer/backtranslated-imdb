The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a movie critic and I'm not going to act like the rest of the snobby people commenting on this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously this movie did not. I do not have a budget of several million dollars, but the plot was very well done, the acting was incredible and the cinematography was great! It seemed like you all had a great time making this movie! I voted for 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I imagine that might have been a mistake in recording the DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other films produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, I thank you!
