I recommend watching this movie with your significant other if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steaming it could tarnish your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original film, we began to see how Tarzan and Jane adapted to the jungle. and to the other. Jane's jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane veils her visitors makes it clear that they are not only romantic but also very sexually passionate. <br /> <br /> One's imagination can complement the constant conversation of touching and loving between Tarzan and Jane portrays how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about emotional, romantic, and sexual love. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with her previously unexplored sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is out of the charts. In addition to the sexy two-piece costume Jane, belly and waist, she also takes a bare dive with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim, who also works for her in this scene) Weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his robe. The ladies will be delighted when Weissmuller comes out of the water after his long struggle with the giant crocodile and blows his scream - with the water-soaked thong practically dropping from the hips. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that overprotective censors have softened the adult nature of Tarzan's films after this entry. Although Weissmuller Tarzan's films still thrive in the coming years, they rarely address the sex appeal of this film.
