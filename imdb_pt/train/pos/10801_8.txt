Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. While I sat there for the next 10 minutes, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and comical behavior make me shake my head as to why he has not been in more comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing, but MUCH MORE, more talent ... not taking anything away from Marty. The film really shocked me with the closeness of the original Jerk, but again, it was so much more. I really think if this movie was first released, and I saw the second film by Steve Martin, I think the second was a cheap blow. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is the actor's second in The Jerk Too. I would like to receive a copy for my collection. I ask you to see if you can find it.
