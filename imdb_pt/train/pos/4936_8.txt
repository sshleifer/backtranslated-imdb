When a rigidity appears with a pneumonic plague (a variant of the bubonic plague), the US Public Health Service official, Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines everyone he knows to be close to the body. Unfortunately, the hard was thus murdered, and there is a good chance that the killer will start spreading the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is enlisted to track down the killer as quickly as possible and avoid a possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> While Panic in the Streets is a quality movie, it suffers from being a bit unfocused and a bit extensive (my reason for reducing the score to eight). He wanders the noirish gangster genres to medical disaster, procedural police, thriller and even novel. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of director Elia Kazan, but saying it is a bit fake. Kazan is the leader responsible for such masterpieces as The Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This movie is prior to these, but Kazan said he was already "unrestrained" by the studio. Taking this freedom too far may partially explain the expansion. The movie is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "used to hang out ... night and day, so I knew it well." He wanted to explore the environment. "It's so fantastic and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints - all from New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better. The film would have benefited from staying with only one or two of its moods. The expansion in configuration would still have worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories from writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold." <br /> <br /> The gangster stuff, which ends in suspense territory with a long chase scene near the end of the movie, is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan said he believes villains are "more colorful - I've never really cared for the good guys anyway. I do not like Puritans." A close second is the only material that addresses the title's "panic" - the discovery of the plague and attempts to track what was exposed, inoculate it and contain the disease. Although there is a lot of suspense during these two "moods", much of the film is also a rather simple drama with a more typical rhythm of this genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is excellent. The stylistic difference of many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It's smart, delivered quickly and well spelled out by each character. Conflict is not created by "dumb" decisions, but by intelligent moves; events and character actions are more like a game of chess. When unusual positions are taken, such as Reed retaining the plague of newspapers, he gives relatively long justifications for his decisions, which other characters discuss. In light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "property, religion, ethics and the middle class are all killing us." This idea enters the film through changes in the norm, or concessions, made by the protagonists. For example, gang boss Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) gets a "Get Out of Prison" card if he cooperates with the pest. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing setting and the well written dialogue.
