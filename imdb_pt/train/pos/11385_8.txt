This is your typical gay and colorful musical from MGM's early 50's and is definitely one of the best to watch out there. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by the expert of the genre Vincente Minnelli and starring Gene Kelly in the lead lead. They both made some movies together in those days, of which this is probably the best known of them. The movie itself actually managed to win the Oscar for best picture throughout the year, which means that it hit movies like "A Place in the Sun", "A Tram Called Desire", "The Queen African ". "," Quo Vadis "," The Blue Veil "," Death of a Salesman "that year. Really an achievement, of course, but at the same time too much credit for this delightful, brilliant and fun movie. When you watch this movie, you will certainly enjoy it all, which is also true.Thanks to the film, its beautiful color appearance and the many cool characters within this film. which is not a big surprise when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But really could not have everything that was said in this movie was done in half an hour less? I mean, we already know where the movie is going, but it can extend everything for as long as possible. Not that it makes the movie creep anywhere, it just makes it a little too long. been made with some less musical numbers. <br /> <br /> One of the best orchestras, this is not without flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
