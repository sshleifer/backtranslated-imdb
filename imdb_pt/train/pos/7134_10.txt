John Thaw is an excellent actor. I have to admit that I was struck by his scope in the role of a grumpy old man who reluctantly agrees to take an evacuated from the streets of London (World War II era). <br /> <br /> That said, the film is also great. A very touching story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters are a little underdeveloped (the school teacher in particular), but none of them are essential to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie does not need anything else.
