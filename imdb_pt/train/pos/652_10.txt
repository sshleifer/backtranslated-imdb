this movie is so complex that any description can be given and still roll with it. you have an insecure, disturbed and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is trapped between two (not, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women he loves. this could be the premise of a chicken movie, full of stiff, cold, uninteresting remarks. however, director Jean Eustache manages to keep him cool, ironic and witty. Being such a long film, we can not help laughing when, after two hours of polite speaking, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly yells on the phone as he remembers an extravagant phrase from a movie. this kind of situation is purely cinematic and can not be fully restored in one comment. nor can anyone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun at the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
