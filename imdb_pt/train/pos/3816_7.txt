"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It portrays the super-religious Korean Christians in a Korean provincial town and the main character's experiences interacting with them following a horrific personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a single widowed mother who moves to Milyang City ("Secret Sunshine" in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She chose Milyang because her late husband (killed in a car accident) was born there, and she feels she needs to make a fresh start in life in a new place. It does not react well to the openings of local Christian zealots, one of whom tries to persuade her to attend church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and drives them away as politely as possible. In fact, she starts brushing almost everyone in Milyang to get started, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade their world, and the consequences are usually hilarious. To say more would be to give the film, but it should be noted that the woman's performance in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is stupendous. Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007, I expected her to have a decent job. But Jeon is captivating and it's impossible to take her eyes off her when she's on the screen. The film is a kind of harrowing work by Evelyn Waugh-esquire, showing how fate may seem insane as well as strangely unavoidable.
