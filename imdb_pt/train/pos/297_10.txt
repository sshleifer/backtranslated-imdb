I'm glad that other people have enjoyed this movie, because I know that it does not have the highest reputation and did not make money at the box office. I thought it was great and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich drives with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple has never gotten better in the movie. You've seen worse movies!
