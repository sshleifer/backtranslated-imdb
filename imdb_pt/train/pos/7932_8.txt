When I watch a low-budget film, I know what to expect. I hope that the performance is not so good (budget reasons), I hope the lighting is not so good (budgetary reasons) that I hope the sound is not so good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget movie! I am a filmmaker, so I understand budget constraints in a low budget film. Stealing locations, shots, etc ... the list goes on. I do not want to say that the whole performance was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. Not sold at Carl Washington yet. He has to understand that each line is not important, some are disposable lines. I say if a movie makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave it a 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great job Quiroz brothers!
