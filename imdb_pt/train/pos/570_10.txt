Embarrassingly, I watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that any parent or sibling can relate to ... one brother is a bit "wild", the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a bit emotional as the big brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly chosen as the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so appealing. The film follows the book closely, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. Unlike most movie book stories, this is measured. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night out with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.
