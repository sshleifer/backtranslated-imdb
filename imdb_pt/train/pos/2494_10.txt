The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and not very funny and had a drama element where Bill (the mother) was struggling with all the usual problems of life, but this element was a little depressing and did not mix well with the elements of comedy that is probably why it was discarded. After that, it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC has ever done! The chemistry between the characters of Bill and Ben was very funny and there have always been so many brilliant and memorable drawings in each series. The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show came to an end when main actor Gary Olsen playing Bill passed away, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP <br /> <br /> This underrated show unfortunately disappeared from our television screens and should not be repeated that many times - Although it does appear on UKTV Gold from time to time, but should be repeated on the BBC one or two to show this brilliant comedy for a new audience
