Who says that the pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is superlative. I even shed a tear when Celebei died. I do not cry a lot! This movie is an exciting thriller of animation. <br /> <br /> In this fourth edition of the pokemon, Ash and friends must stop the bad push of making Celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball. At the time, Sam and Celebei travel in time and are continually hunted by hunters. I like the part with the double battle and Sam has the apricot pokeball (if you've ever played gold, silver or crystal pok√©mon, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed having the miramax in command instead of Warner Brothers. Placing the mini movie at the end was a great idea. The pokemon in this movie comes to life more than ever.
