Extract the most fun parody of pretentious art film ever made. <br /> <br /> This movie exposes all the clich√©s, and then some! Sincerely bad (Down Syndrome!) Actors. Terribly important dialogue. Scenes that should shock, but suddenly fall. Shocking editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of miasma of disrespect to the public and psychopath vagabond. He gets exactly what was planned. A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled trusting teen financiers, to show their parents when they ask what they have done in the last two years! After "What's this?" received his prize from Cannes, it was said that presenter Werner Herzog would have said that the film was actually a parody, in part from his own films! He supposedly blew up the information. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch and laugh, this will be a humor classic for many years.
