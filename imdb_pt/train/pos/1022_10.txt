Stargate is the best show of all time. All actors are absolutely perfect for roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this program yet, I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star Trek most of the time, it really can not be because it is completely different. I am a fan of star trek, but I would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not have Stargate on our TV, so if I want to watch it I have to buy DVDs and Season 10 is not here yet, so I can not see for a long time (which is very depressing). However, this program is very good and is a must see, but be warned that it is highly addictive. So in the summer I love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
