This is another "tell-what-is-it" Madhur Bhandarkar movie. I do not know why he has this obsession in showing kids and teenage concepts to the Indian public, but I think some of these scenes are really disgusting! What's new? It is a beautiful piece set by Bhandarkar, where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by the protagonist of the famous movie Mr & Mrs Iyer. What makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people with whom this reporter interacts or is a friend, such as his roommates, co-stars, movie stars, role models, rich people, and other people on Entertainment Page # 3 in his newspaper. <br /> <br /> Noticeable: It is another good performance of Mrs. Iyer. She will probably be noticed by this role. She plays selective roles, but shines on them. She is notably de-glamorous and less beautiful in this movie. But then, entertainment reporters should not overshadow the people they cover, right? Verdict: Madhur appeared with another good movie, which brings social issues to the limelight very well. However, this movie loses focus and is not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting it with REAL life? Is he trying to tell us how the government and the rich control the press? or he is trying to illustrate problems with child abuse and g * and folk. The other concepts brought in include the unwritten rule that girls have to sleep with directors or co-stars if they want to get into Bollywood. <br /> <br /> In addition, he talks about how flight attendants get sick and tired. of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures marrying much older, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoiled children in wealthy families. <br /> <br /> All of this was fine for me ... but it could be too complex for a regular moviegoer, who just wants to relieve the stress of everyday life
