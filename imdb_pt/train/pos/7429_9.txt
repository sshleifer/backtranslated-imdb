She's such an extraordinary singer, she cares about anything else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments of the biz - bar none !! I'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves this iconic status - such is the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I was five and it had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther wanting to leave the Grammy right when her prize is being announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other users' comments are simply clear. false - I mean, where's the free nudity - maybe we've seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a big ego - fine! <br /> <br /> She deserved it.
