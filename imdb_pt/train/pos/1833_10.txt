The basic plot here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry, in the eyes of Ishwar his son Aditya can do nothing wrong, the mother of Aditya Sumitra (Shefali Shah ) warns Ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late, for Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and is only 9 months old to live when his son runs away and marries Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar readily forgives Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali return from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, and this forces Ishwar to expel Aditya from home to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he does not know that either. his father expelled him from the hose to make him more responsible, Ishwar can not take himself to the high Aditya that he is about to die with a hungry and pregnant wife. it's a race against time, so Aditya does everything she can to prove herself to her father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets her big break in the film industry and her father says he's about to die. <br /> This film is absolutely brilliant, this is the breakthrough in Indian cinema that was necessary for the Bollywood industry, Shah's direction is almost perfect, but which movie has no flaws? The best part if this movie is the relationship of the father's son who is a tearjerker. the interludes of music are put in the right moment, the setting is good, the only part where the film fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are very long and after a while are annoying but overall it is a movie brilliant, I would advise anyone reading this review to go and watch, regardless of other reviews. 9/10
