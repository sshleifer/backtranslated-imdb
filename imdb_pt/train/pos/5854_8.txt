This game is fun and has a storyline you could actually expect to see in the comics. The spider-man was framed by a mysterious imposter. The city is being invaded by a strange gas, and simbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, he seems to have delivered a new sheet. Venom also does not seem to be involved, since he is simply impressed that Spider-Man apparently cost him a good photographic opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and many villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fight is basic, it is not difficult to catch, the struggles with the bosses are very funny. You start collecting comics, you run out of webs and it's a little fun to cross the city. However, this is also a weak point. The swing is not as good as all you do is pass through town while Spider-Man apparently attaches his webs to the sky. You also do not have much web-maneuverability, especially when compared to a Spider-man 2 video game. Still, it makes up for the bad balance with the other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage in an action-packed wild adventure.
