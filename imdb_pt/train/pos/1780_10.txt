My mother and I were on our way home from a trip to the Northeast (especially Massachusetts) when we decided to make a small detour to attend a Boston film festival. Now, I do not know much about movies, so I thought this might be a bit educational. The first movie we saw was this, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I do not know about you, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas and from where I come we do not see many movies, so this was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted it was very violent, but said that I did not know much about what she was saying, but this was a great photo. I was shocked by the fight sequences they were great at. Besides, I'm a big fan when the good guys win, so I was thrilled when the Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. This was the true brightness. I'm not sure when it will be released on video, but if you have the chance, check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise, however, is quite violent and there are many bad words that you do not want to let your children watch. It's more for adults.
