Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other successful and acclaimed surfers, Endless Summer by Dana Brown, her successor Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, son of Dana, and Step in (IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /> <br /> While the images of the surf are spectacular, I value the historical perspective of most of the filmmakers. It takes us back to the origins of the sport almost 100 years ago and shows how it evolved into its current form. This includes extensive interviews with personalities and cutting-edge artists, as surfboard designs have changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were most frequented by world-class surfers and what incredible adrenaline rush the sport provided them. Athletes lived for months on the beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped in rude bunk beds, fished for food, and returned to the boards the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We have seen how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost for the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect copyright may prevent you from giving credit to the Beachboys surfing songs, such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing magazine and the Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a volume) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the pioneers of the sport, their families and how the current generation benefited from the breeders in the 1960s. One such story is how Laird Hamilton, 40, considered the greatest surfer today, joined a former surfer. introduced her single mother, whom she married before becoming her stepfather. <br /> <br /> An exciting musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies history. Have I waited for your appetite? Wonderful. Have a great tour.
