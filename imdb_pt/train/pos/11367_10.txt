Caution: May contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 3 times and I enjoyed it every time. Seeing you again, I always remember how good it is. An HBO TV movie - very well done like most of its films - would have received an Oscar for its performances had it been released for general distribution rather than made for TV. <br /> <br /> As I'm sure Anyone know of reading other comments here, this is the story of the serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people in 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be found, so he was convicted only 52 of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man who becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer, despite the additional obstacles posed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very touching scene at the end of the film that mentions how, in America, investigators are routinely removed from serial killer cases after 18 months, whether they like it or not because of mental strain and frustration. According to this accusation, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, tells him that he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing that he should have given him a break earlier. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is so good. done, he does not exaggerate, chews the scene or does anything that distracts from his portrait of a man who is determined to find his killer. He is a man with passion, but does not show in the same way as is usually depicted in police films. It only occasionally gives out explosions after quietly silently more than most could bear under such circumstances. Rea does a lot with his face, his eyes, he does not have to exaggerate. He's just * - His character, so frustrated after all this time, at one point, led to frustration, he actually says he prefers to find 3 at once than none in a year. Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. It makes us understand, but a glimpse of what it is to live with so much horror and futility. <br /> <br /> A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one that produces such "monsters." The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. Somehow (as impossible as it may seem), it causes a bit of sympathy for itself. Maybe he's the worst of us, terribly wrong? Either way, its performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General), also does a great job. It starts off looking like a cynical mundane officer who does not seem much more interested in aiding the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov. But he ends up becoming more than just an assistant, he really participates actively helping Burakov. There is also a very nice twist of Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it is more about what it takes to capture a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well done film with excellent performances and a great screenplay. The script manages to do what's best for this type of film: giving factual events and putting them meaningfully into a dramatic picture that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
