As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific guy. He has made hundreds and hundreds of films, many of which suck. However, he managed to infiltrate an occasional quality job between all the assembly line exploration. "Succubus" is not his best work (this is "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many of its trademarks that make it compulsory for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog. It combines the erotic (alternating between showing full frontal nudity and leaving something to the imagination) and the surreal perfectly. This is a very dreamy movie, full of great atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the constant appointment. Although it sounds incredibly pretentious, it's fun to hear all the influences of Franco. <br /> <br /> Still, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I can see where they come from. Its pace slow, but I can handle it. More incoherent is the problem. The script here was obviously rushed, and within five minutes of the movie I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and never actually joined from there). Those who want some substance with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful. Still, I was entertained with all the psychedelic nonsense that I did not really care much about these big flaws. (7/10)
