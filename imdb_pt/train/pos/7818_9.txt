I think the context of the story was covered by other posters, so I would just like to write about the impact that this movie has had on me. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in the year of release in 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see, for a RE project I think. We all went along the lively course because we were on a school trip to the movies! Little did we know what we were about to try. To this day I still remember the feelings he invoked in me and I remembered to cry a lot like most of my friends. I think at the age we were, we find it shocking and silent, with outraged reason of our own youthful way. It had such a huge impact on me that I joined the Anti-Apartheid Movement in the same year. <br /> <br /> I think it served its purpose in my case.
