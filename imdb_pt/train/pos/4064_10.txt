I've never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated this movie. I bet anyone who wins is a petty saboteur or a victim of one. This movie has it all. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan of ...?" Then go see "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). Anyway, this is among my top five. And I've seen a lot of movies.
