A brilliant Russian emigrant invents Stanislavsky's system to win the contract bridge - what makes him and his beautiful wife, America's Great Boyfriends. <br /> <br /> What could have just been another idiotic novel is high. for good production values ​​and excellent acting for the status of a very nice little comedy. Some unexpected touches are thrown to keep the attention of the engaged viewer - the way in which the main cast is introduced as faces in a deck of cards; the introduction of a zany acrobat in the plot for no other reason but to enjoy a little madness; and the way in which a wide variety of different types of Americans are paralyzed listening to the broadcast of the final game. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas and Loretta Young do very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas Smooth and sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful (even if the script makes her smoke a cigarette too much). They are fun to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most convincing or convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. The charming Glenda Farrell avoids her usual persona of thinking of a small role as McHugh's friend. Roscoe Karns deals with the quick dialogue as a brash radio announcer. The diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a bridge snob specialist. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent nightclub patron; Emma Dunn as a single reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer in the final game of the bridge - all without credits. <br /> <br /> The film takes advantage of the contract bridge fashion that swept the country since its development in the 1920s. It hopes the viewer will have a basic understanding of the intricacies of the game and will not try to explain anything to the uninformed.
