As an adult I really enjoyed this one. I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old laughed at the mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This sequel does what the return to Neverland did not realize. A good accompaniment to Cinderella's story; but what about Drusilla? Another sequel? I believe so!
