White man + progress + industrialization = ADB. First nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula. In fact, in the last days, the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; is now used to attack. However, that said, I think the film manages to overcome banal politicization, because it plays with the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. You may not agree with the film's revisionism of how the West was conquered, lost. But anyone can miss the days when horses could run freely on the western plains. (The movie also conveniently avoids the fact that there were no horses in America before the wicked white man took them there.) Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening photo - is incredible.
