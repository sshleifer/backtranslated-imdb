Going through the Sci Fi weekly section of the local video store store, I was losing hope of finding good movies I had not yet seen. Renting Cypher was like a kick in a possibly very lame horse. My son is so tired of the current science fiction "B" that he did not bother to see it yet. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, that was a very nice surprise! This is not a B movie either. It's not a blockbuster of the epic variety and it does not try to be - another quiet movie that needs to be seen multiple times for its plot to be fully savored. <br /> <br /> Special effects are powerful. presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously CGI at first sight, but they hit on their appearance 2, and that rest everything else is top notch. In any case, the affections are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything about the plot. The structure of the plot has an aspect of Russian Doll that somewhat resembles the Basic Instinct (although with very different content). <br /> <br /> I'll just say that Picking Jeremy Northam for the lead was a masterstroke. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this film comes to the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect, it's a little out of the way. See the final plot twist and you'll see why this is such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is also just right with her "she's going to kiss me - she's going to shoot me" edge. <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them.
