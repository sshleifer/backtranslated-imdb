I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if he bears any resemblance to them, I did not realize it. I like the quality of the cinematography storybook. I even like the love story though, while I'm enjoying myself, I wonder, deep down in my mind, how that part of the story can really unfold, since Ned can not touch Chuck or ... well, you know . I even like Chuck, I do not find her annoying, and I usually hate very sweet, cool and perfect characters. I even like the voice of the narrator, even though it bothers one of my family members and discovers some resemblance to some Walgreens commercials. I could dwell on all the other things about Ned's situation and how writers will approach this in the future, but I'd rather watch and wait and see what the writers weave.
