Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurous films that were popular during the eighties. Wayne Crawford stars as Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights evildoers wherever he goes. With their assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they are looking for some action (and some decent stories). The pair meet a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins), whose sister was abducted by an evil white slave trader (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her rescue her brother? <br /> <br /> A cheesy and cheesy movie that does not pretend to be something it is not. I have to give this one a recommendation. That's if you like movies that like to have fun and for those who do not accept everything for their apparent value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
