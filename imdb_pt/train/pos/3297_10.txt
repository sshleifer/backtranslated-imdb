The last tribute to a great film actress. The film is a masterpiece of poetry on screen. I like great poetry is timeless. Direction, cast, script, music, lyrics, in fact, all rules for making film are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film. Muslim society in India was never presented with such respect, nobility and reality. The script is memorable in the hands of Meena, Ashok, Raaj Kumar, Nadira etc to name a few. Personally I was more impressed by the regal Kamal Kapoor. The lasting legacy of master filmmaker Kamal Amrohi to the subcontinent. A very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity seek and face the reality of the outcasts in the world. ? Pakeeza! haha Pakeza'.Such acting is unheard of in this age of sex, dance and pornography.
