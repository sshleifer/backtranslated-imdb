I have never seen this movie until recently in TCM and I found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of the local cities, as well as many other European cities, for example: Norway. The First World War was over and the people in this town were still suffering with their lost soldiers and the wounded that the War always creates. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former teacher of the city. He was raised as a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and they also did not accept him completely. When the Hitler party grew to power, Wilhelm Grimm wished to become a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for his treatment of him, which was really all in his mind. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are shown in this photo with the Jewish people going to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie yet, and like this subject, give some of your time; this movie is very realistic for a 1944 movie and a story you will not soon forget.
