Incredible documentary. I saw this on the original date of release and on DVD a few times in recent years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary in 2002, the year it was released. No other documentary comes close. <br /> <br /> I recently went on TV for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the added segment "where are they now" at the end, except that I realized that Tony now works for the hazardous materials unit. <br /> <br /> I've seen reviews about the documentary of some on this list. I can not see how this could have been done differently. They had less than 6 months to mount this and put it in the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that, according to the director, the brother has not had projects in the four years since. What are they doing?
