A hiker looking for a job is mistaken for a killer in a small town in Wyoming, leading to all sorts of complications. Cage is perfectly chosen as the unfortunate unlucky in the hope of making a quick buck and get out of town, but thinking that he can not escape the title city. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psychopath known as "Dallas Lyle," the real killer. Walsh as a devious sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale complete the good cast. The screenplay by brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delightful twists and turns, and John's direction creates a fantastic neo-noir atmosphere. Witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer from the start and never lets up.
