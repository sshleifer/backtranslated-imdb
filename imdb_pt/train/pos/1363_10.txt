A great movie from the 90's! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires lots of money. Posey gives incredible performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a good and light movie for the Saturday night before you leave. The soundtrack rocks, the clothes are out of this world, the script is funny and the actors do a great job. The redeeming value: you can do it in this world, if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this type of character: young, fabulous and bankrupt. (You should look for the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you watch Party Girl, you're bound to have fun. Appreciate!
