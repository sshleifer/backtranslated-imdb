I was literally getting ready to hate this movie, so believe me when I say this movie is worth seeing. Overall, the story and the jokes are invented, but the film has the charm and the delicacy to withdraw them. That joke in which Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss / future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself is not very smart, but this has caused me a frenzy of laughter. Very few jokes in the movie are high brow, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are also nice. I must say that I would like to see more of the character of James Brolin, since he was a hoot in the few scenes in which he was. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the nerve to not make the character of the wife (who serves as an obstacle in the plot) a total witch. Selma Blair's character is hardly unpleasant, and there is never a scene in which I thought to myself, "Why did he want to marry her in the first place?" The ending is Hollywood-ish, but it could have been a lot weirder. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I did not take a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's mainstream work. I simply loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I could not help but feel disappointed to see him in those stupid roles. And he never seems comfortable in these doped papers. Even in this movie, he does not seem perfectly comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and effectively deals with each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she is so incredibly nice. Of course, she is a very pretty girl, with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, its beauty is shown inside and out. I do not know the names of the actresses, but the woman who plays the drunken grandmother is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and it's always nice to watch, which makes me want to get better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that it's a shame she did not have the same opportunities to show off her skills. <br /> <br /> Do not get discouraged with the horrible trailers and the box office records even more horrible. This is a funny and charming movie. Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it seems like the genre itself is ready to be thrown in the toilet, so it's always nice to see one of those rotten apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
