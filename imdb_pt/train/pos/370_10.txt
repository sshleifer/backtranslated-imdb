I've seen this movie at least fifty times and after seeing it last week for the first time in a long time I still feel it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible but came to life with Spielberg's expertise and fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for his short but powerful portrait of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience all human emotions as you watch this movie. I laughed, I cried and I became angry. Like most of the great films, it was examined by the Academy with a series of indications, but without victories. But this movie, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best films of all time.
