If you like CB4, you have no idea what you're missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is crazy hilarious, and incorporates much more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on DVD because it is a movie that everyone watched with loved it and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a bit familiar with some old school artists, definitely rent this movie. There are not many video rental sites that have copies of it, but if you find one, you will not be disappointed.
