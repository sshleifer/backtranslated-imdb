Sunny, a waitress in the D.C. area, is a bit overshadowed, to put up a bit. She runs an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple. However, she saves the life of a prominent Arab, carrying a bullet in the butt that was for the clerk. She delights the national press with her silly remarks and her sweet appearance. Sniffing an opportunity, the presidential aides install it in the protocol department of the US government. Even so, she spoils things sometimes, but she tries hard and learns a lot. It even catches the romantic attention of a State Department official. But is there another sinister plot being made involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? A blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This film presents Goldie as beautiful as an image and as dumb "as a fox," as they say. Sunny learns very well the forest of the US government. She even has important things to say about honesty and lack of it in her protocol environment. Perhaps the Arab community is not very excited about this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent it out today.
