In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four guys from the city face the wrath of nature in a survival story. The setting is the hinterland of Georgia, with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray minor characters. These sites imbue the film with an unmatched depth of characterization in the history of cinema. No central "actor" could approach the faces, voices or remarkable actions of these people. I can not remember a movie in which the supporting characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else, it's this brave realism that makes this movie so incredible. <br /> <br /> Another force is the theme of the movie. Nature, in nature, can be violent. How appropriate is the scenario to be the southern US. Very few places in the US are or were as violent as the country hill country. In a story about Darwin's survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separated from it. <br /> <br /> "Liberation" is a product of the time when, unlike today, Americans expressed concern about a disappearing desert. The magnificent landscape of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the roar of the rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, convey an environmental message. And that's another force in the movie. <br /> <br /> On an entertainment level, tension gradually increases as the plot continues. Not even in the middle of the movie does the tension become extreme and then never ends until the final credits roll. Very few films can sustain this level of intensity in such a long period of plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is top notch. Direction and editing are impeccable. Cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the performance is great. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a good job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it's the music, which seems timid to me. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Deliverance" will almost certainly draw viewers who enjoy outdoor adventures. Even for those who do not, the courageous characterizations, the acting and the tension of the plot are enough reasons to watch this movie, one of the best in the history of cinema.
