I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... almost everything has already been said about the film, but there is one detail that I would like to shed some light on: no footage of the real, still standing, Hôtel du Nord (still? I heard it was to be demolished ...) was used for the film - the whole scene was rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks.
