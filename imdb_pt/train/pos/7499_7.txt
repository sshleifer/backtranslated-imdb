But it's a bit hilarious, at least if you grew up in Weird Al, like I did. It's a mockumentary about your life and career, starting with stardom and coming back to track down the origins. It is uneven in some places, but some of the segments are still very funny, especially when it goes to Japan. Although not as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and it does not find love as fast as it is, it catches in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is the life in the streets of Tokyo. <br /> <br /> Maybe Weird Al is not recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is; maybe a rose with another name would smell so sweet. Still, this is a funny movie.
