This is a classic British comedy thriller that I've always wanted to check out, but no opportunity has come up for it until now. It is based on a popular play that had been filmed several times previously (most notably in 1931 by the same director, but unfortunately this version does not seem to have survived in its entirety!); For the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the current war situation. Anyway, I was familiar with the first British comedians through the Will Hay films: given that it presents a similar plot of legendary haunts, smugglers and enemy agents, it is very much in this sense (it was actually scripted by the team of Edgar Marriott's regular writers, Guest Guest and JOC Orton); the element of stranded travelers, then, was a formula equally tested and proven. The star this time is Arthur Askey (aided by Richard Murdoch) - none of whose films I had seen before - who is as unlikely a hero as Hay himself and whose personality proves to be so potentially annoying ... but soon warms up to him , and Askey certainly comes with a number of witty and entertaining lines everywhere to justify the fact that the main character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split in two here, with Murdoch acting as the direct partner of the star . <br /> <br /> The unique remote setting (the events of the film take place largely during a stormy night) provides a wonderful atmosphere; the last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the owner's own vehicle - is especially exciting and well treated. Also worthy of mention of the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the scared stereotypical spinster with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her first drink.
