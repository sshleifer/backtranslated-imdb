Robert Mitchum star as Clint Tollinger in this small but difficult western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional tamer city - as in when a city needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought to do this. The last show of Tollinger appears like an accident: strolling through the city in search of its old adventure, it is faced with a city being touched like a marionette by a local gangster. But many people in town start to regret the day they hired Tollinger, as their way of cleaning the city becomes very draining (Suddenly, the High Plains Drifter looks less original). <br /> <br /> The film Man With The Gun starts out as an average Western movie but begins to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What starts as forgettable and mediocre ends up gloomy and centered on the character. The whole film is very well filmed and the cast is a lot of fun. Mitchum is his usual great self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective presence as a tough man at high speed and he beats the action-packed, meaningful and shocking scenes of The movie left the park. Man With The Gun is a good Western Mitchum and worth your time.
