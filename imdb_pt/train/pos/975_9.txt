Also known as the Great Scare War. The Great War of Yokai is Miike's attempt to make a family movie and a great job he does as well. The problem is that I can not imagine many parents wanting to submit their children to this movie. The best children's films are those that are scary or have slightly disturbing images, Neverending Story and Return to Oz come to mind, but in the case of the Great Yokai War, Miike probably takes things a bit too far. In fact, on display I was in the person who introduced the movie reiterated to the two families there which probably was not very suitable. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the young hero of the play introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems. This brief moment of worldliness is brutally broken when a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human who cries out that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the hideous absolute of the creature is some bizarre homage to Quato). <br /> <br /> After an incredible introduction to the main villain Kato, and his henchman Agi (surprisingly attractive, Chiaki Kuriyami), through an apocalyptic army on the rise. The story returns to normal for a while, but it does not take long for any logic to go down the drain and the young man joins a group of Miyazaki rejected to eliminate the evil sorcerer. The plot of the film is pretty basic and surprisingly banal at times, the whole chosen one seems completely out of place in a movie that so regularly breaks down cliches but is aided by a simple awe-inspiring vision of a magical world. This is really a Miyazaki movie made in a live action movie, although a much sordid and crueler Miyazaki movie than usual. <br /> <br /> The film is simply a joy to look at Yokai's colorful, and largely practical, drawings while evil robotic monstrosities not displaying the best CGI in the world have a practicality and a threat to them, which gives them a much more palpable threat than you would imagine. <br /> <br /> The cast is uniformly excellent, they just make their characters look perfectly natural, which is commendable when one considers that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits. Even Agi, with a ridiculous hive, appears as stuffy and deadly thanks to Kuriyami's surprisingly excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Although the film has many elements that place it firmly in the territory of family cinema; cute creatures, junior heroes, a completely evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a revealing lack of violence. There are elements that make you wonder if Miike should have directed such a movie. <br /> <br /> The robot army is a genuinely terrifying threat, day-to-day items transformed into monstrous beasts that look like T-101 without the skin and chainsaws added. . These beasts tear characters into pieces; suck the creatures to their blood-stained mouths and kidnap children from their homes by passing them under their parents' noses before surrendering to a small patrician. <br /> <br /> The creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds. The Yokai, essentially the heroes, are fed in a giant furnace filled with a liquefied form of hatred that corrodes the Yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess pieces of metal. If the kids thought that Anakin was burning, it was bad to wait until they saw a man-sized sea urchin burning to death in a barrel of molten hate for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle. There is also separation of limbs in one case, a severed hand contracts in front of the camera with blood, a good amount of sexual energy (Agi wears a dress designed specifically for the fan service and seems to have only sleep with Kato as motivation , while the Princess of the Rivers uses almost nothing and makes her thighs be touched by the young hero in several scenes), and general humor that goes straight to the heads of those that this technicolor wonder was projected. <br /> <br /> Spoilers An example of this is that the Yokai are only interested in the final battle when they think it's a big party. The ensuing battle is more of a festival than anything, complete with beer, crowd surfing and moshing. Also a scene in which Agi defeats the tarry of a fluffy and fluffy creature seems destined to lure the weary masses by an exaggeration of pokemon. <br /> <br /> End of spoilers At the end of the day, the Great War of Yokai is easy Miike's strongest recent films. Although it lacks a bit of the perverse charm of, say, Gozu or Ichi, it is continually pushing the public onto a path of general insanity. In fact, this is easily the craziest movie of Miike, because he embraces the pure magic of the subject so sincerely. <br /> <br /> Well, it pays to watch only for the occasional flash of Gogo's butt.
