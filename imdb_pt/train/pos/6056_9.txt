Super Speedway makes a great demonstration of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera puts you in the race car, where you travel through multiple tracks at high speed, remembering the driving sequences in the Grand Prix (if it appears on DVD!). I like watching again and again. <br /> <br /> The only negative sign, and why I did not give 10, is that some of the directional sequences seem suspiciously like the movie was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear swooshes as you pass under bridges.
