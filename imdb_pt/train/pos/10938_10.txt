Rarely have I ever encountered a movie so complete that I must speak about it immediately. This film is definitely one of the best entertainments available and is highly authentic. By chance, I saw the dubbed version, but I'm on my way now to get the remastering of the DVD with the original Chinese dialogue. Still, the dubbing did not mess up and sometimes provided a very funny mood: "The Poison Clan shakes the world !!!" <br /> <br /> Storytelling remains true to Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense. and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 poisons are revealed and an expert rhythm. <br /> <br /> The fight choreography of the martial arts is a class of its own and must be seen to be believed. It's like watching real animals fight against each other, but built from their own forms of arcane martial arts. This level of skill among the cast is unsurpassed in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a serious dose of ancient Chinese culture and I recommend it only based on the film's genuine intent to tell a martial art history and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you want to see people pounding, along with coarse forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
