OK. Yes, this was a very tight budget film with bugs of continuity (like solitary scenes obviously filmed in the sun and then in the shade and then mixed), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso he was often a little too good on the burn. -out part, and some of the minor supporting cast was very bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). But let's go. Richard Grieco was hysterical (only his hair is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some fine lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Funny? Great yes. I would love to have been on set the day they decided what kind of Grieco hairstyle would have. "You are fast?" ... "You're not that fast."
