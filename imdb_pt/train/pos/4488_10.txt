Here's a perfect Tom & Jerry cartoon for Halloween. I know it does not have much shiver, but it has the trick as in "Trick or Treat," as Jerry did for Tom with the blind window and the vacuum cleaner with a collared shirt hanging on him to make him look like a ghost; but I still like to put it on my list of Halloween designs. At that moment, Tom was listening to "Time of Witchcraft," a ghost story show on the radio, and being startled by the horror story being told. In the middle of the story, the dramas (standing hair, heart jumping in the throat, chills chills in the spine) begin to happen with Tom. . literally. And Jerry has been watching the whole thing and laughing to himself, thought that it would increase Tom's fears by scaring him. <br /> <br /> I love the ending, it was kind of funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others being The Lonely Mouse, A Mouse in the House and Nit-Witty Kitty. And also This short is the first of the twenty-five cartoons in which Tom speaks. The others are The Lonely Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The One Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Problems, The Mouse Comes to Dinner, Quiet Please !, Happy Trap, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Up and the mouse below, directed by Chuck Jones.
