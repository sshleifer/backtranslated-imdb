After watching WW1's spy thriller Madame Lili (1969) starring Julie Andrews on TV this afternoon, I suddenly thought I'd seen a much higher WW1 espionage thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It took a little search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. As soon as I recognized the title, the memories returned. It is, in turn, a reasonably well-crafted story that revolves around real events like Kitchener's death and the German offensives of 1918. She also has a spy that is far more believable than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory was of well-produced battle scenes and men and horses with gas masks. If you are interested in war movies and particularly in WW1, it is worth seeing a movie if you have the opportunity.
