Yeah, it's a girl's movie and it moves a little slow, but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what she is, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural and compelling performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery of the small, coastal summer season is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the film. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that attracts you and keeps your attention. Overall, I give it a 8/10. Go see that.
