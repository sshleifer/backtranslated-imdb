Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this version of 1985 that sounded interesting. Wow!! It was fantastic! A kind of Ken Russell film - very interesting, stylized, very artistic and, of course, "different." Nero was introduced not so much as the evil embodied, but as a mad and dissatisfied emperor who preferred to have a circus career. He probably wondered why the hell he was put in the position of "leading" an empire - it was not much fun, and fun is what he wanted. Klause Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played for all that was worth. Yes, Nero persecuted the Christians with vengeance; one of many who did this. At one point, one of his henchmen murmurs, "No one will ever understand that we were simply protecting ourselves." He got it right.
