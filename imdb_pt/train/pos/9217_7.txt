This really funny movie has a cast of characters, virtually all the voluptuous middle-aged women in Hollywood, and a funny and moving love story. The Capomezza and the Malacici are rival suppliers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also at opposite ends - ends of the flavor scale. His sons are cast for the main roles of a production of the church of Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On the stage! The chaos and confusion this causes, as the parents rival each other and their children, are thrown out by us against the backdrop of the magnificently tasteless house of Capomezza, and its magnificent, tasteless wedding restaurants. <br /> <br /> The four exaggerated parents and the lovely young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a clear-spoken grandmother, a woman who waves with a wand and conveys spiritual advice that she receives from a medium called The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds in the shape of the back seat of a car and two doves. There is not a joke or a joke that does not click on this movie fast. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low eyebrows," and "Malacici" could mean "arrogant snobs." <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive about Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love this!
