This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I've seen this movie so many times and I think it's real today (2003) when Italy suffers again with a kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the US). I'm glad there are outcasts like the one interpreted by Mastroianni in this film that can sing out of tune; perhaps they can teach Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and strive to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: as most people here have mentioned the acting is wonderful, but the audio background is amazing. I must suppose that unfortunately something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the display of machismo, the distortion of reality in the ever present radio-chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can really make you tremble! <br /> <br /> A work of art! <br /> <br />
