Despite the other reviews listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie ever made; a film that reflects - for good or ill - the country's socio-political feelings during Reagan's glory years of the early 1980s. It is also an incredible action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening with a liberal judge revoking a murder case due to the lack of tangible evidence and then going straight to the cafe with various unfortunate unfortunates (the scene that warns the famous line "Go ahead, do my day ")," Sudden Impact "is an endless roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you catch your breath is when annoying Inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby town to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It only gets better there with an exaggerated bunch of grotesque bandits to deal with Callahan, along with a sheriff with a mysterious past. Outstanding directing and photography and a hilarious script help make this movie one of the best of the 80's.
