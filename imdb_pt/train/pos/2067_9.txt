While it is universally recognized that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode "They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be," whether that makes it a steal or a tribute is a completely more controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I subscribe to the last belief, although the less charitable can not do so. James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of running such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sound like a recipe for disaster, but he does it in style, the teaser being an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader is teeming with the threat of Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality of Fearful Symmetry and enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X-file.
