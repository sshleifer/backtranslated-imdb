After seeing Dick Tracy at the $ 6.99 bin in the Future Shop, I decided to take a chance with no prior knowledge and be a big fan of the Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very entertaining, clever entertainment movie with solid performances throughout. The film follows well, has another solid performance of Warren Beatty, but the highlights of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a gangster trying to overthrow the city. Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you get the attitude of wanting to watch a fun and clever movie with great acting and a solid script, try Dick Tracy. I do not think you will be disappointed. And pay attention to the cameos of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.
