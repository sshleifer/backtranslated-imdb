The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and very good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories about the characters! Explaining just enough to get excited! Of course this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters that for some reason do not appear in the third season! Many of the characters have a decent upload, but some of them just are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will return in later episodes! But it is a bit inconsistent! That said, "Lost" succeeds in every episode (especially in the first two seasons)! This is a very difficult thing to do! I notice that in Season Three the focus is more on character development than on the mysterious aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves a few episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But eventually I will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get the closure! The danger of "Lost" being canceled due to declining ratings is coming! And that would be devastating!
