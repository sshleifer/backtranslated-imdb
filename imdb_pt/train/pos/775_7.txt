It's a strange, but somehow impressive, story about love. Personally, I've never stuck a story so weird in real life. But, I can imagine that it exists. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" with the title. But after watching him, I did not have this feeling of "illness" that I would certainly have in relation to the rules of society. It's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can not contradict using any moral or societal rule. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves and finally ends. You feel the moment when this love blossoms, the first whispers, the touches. You feel the connection. And no time I think this is immoral. You even hope it does not break in the end ... it can not break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of being hart broken in the end ... <br /> <br /> But, I also need to add a negative twist to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not somehow * showed * to give the feeling that these relationships are sick only in form, but not in content. You do not have the whole story, but only fragments. When the film began, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no clue about the nature of the relationship. You feel only a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break that relationship. I think this line from Kiki to Sandu says it all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do as I ask." <br /> <br /> This movie will probably stir up some questions about what love is and what it is to be moral ... and where the boundary between them is. I do not know if the idea of ​​this movie is "love conquers everything ... up to social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where." But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that makes you think ...
