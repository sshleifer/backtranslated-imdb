College friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their school. As they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge, the two begin a video diary to explain their feelings and narrate their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar film like this, called "Elephant". Why do I bring this? To compare the two films, of course. I have to say, although I like "Elephant", this is a much better movie. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, this is done differently, very much along the lines of "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead". This makes the film even better because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what got me was how the film was willing to show the "other side of the story." You know these two marksmen, unlike "Elephant." I really cared about one of the shooters and I could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie really makes you feel supportive of these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real humans with logic and reasons behind their actions. You can understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this movie is emotionally thrilling and very scary and way better than "Elephant".
