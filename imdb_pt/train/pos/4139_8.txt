I really wonder how this show plays in the UK and the rest of Europe. He is so self-proclaimed for being American (mostly white Americans). This could be a great reason for some of the poisons and vitriol expressed here in this picture. I love the show but it's with some reservations and I feel like it was easy to Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Crash and burn it all at the end of the second season. Julie closed the door with all hope of reliving the show, unless her character fell into a haystack in the middle of some farm. Who knows? It was a funny show, cheeky and occasionally scary.
