I must confess that I was completely shocked by this movie. For one thing, I went to see him on a whim hoping for something mediocre, but given that, the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist American cinema at all. This is British comedy at its best - dark, quirky and funny in ways that American movies never are. However, I must stop recommending it to everyone; I went to see him with several people, some English, some European and some American and while some of us loved (mainly the first two groups), some hated and found useless. If you think you're in that sort of thing, then go. If not, do not do it. 10/10.
