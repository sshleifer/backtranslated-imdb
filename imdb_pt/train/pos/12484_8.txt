This movie scared me! I have to admit that I spent most of the movie watching through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I screamed loudly two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> In the movies, my favorite aspects were sound and photography. The sound was particularly large and the scenery was really creepy. I read somewhere that it's a weird husband and wife team who did it. For some reason, it makes it even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you like the heels and nerves of horror movies than this one is for you! Very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a lot of friends who love watching movies rolled up on a couch screaming like little girls!
