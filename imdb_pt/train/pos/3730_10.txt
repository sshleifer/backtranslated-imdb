If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then Tigerland is the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scenes from this movie look so real; It's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life, but with drama. Boy, I tell you ... REAL drama that they really real "fought" in one of the scenes (get the DVD listen to the comment is not obvious). I see this movie as a bunch of desperate young people trying to escape an ill-fated fate after watching the Rescue of Private Ryan. I have an appreciation of what a "fateful fate" is and know exactly how the men in the movie feel. I see this movie as a crossbreed between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "hard pressed" in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men in fists, some use drugs, some sleep at random with prostitutes trying to ruthlessly eradicate the meaning of the love of their lives, some try to drink the pain, some jump from buildings or bridges, some feel me guilty and the others feel so much agony that leaves them so sick that they collapse - physically. This movie has all those desperate emotions in one ball. But do not get me wrong, it's not a depressing movie, it's realistic, it's a very humorous film, the arrogant and fun Bozz (Collin's Character) lights up everything and there are also about 5 actresses in the film. ; I'll let you find out what they're there for! With dialogues, action sequences / war, imagine perfect scenes along with appropriate music; this movie has it all, as I said: top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is heavily under-credited. The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in bold and great writing "The best movie of the year", and absolutely falls no less than that. Save the rare jewels in Hollywood, 10/10.
