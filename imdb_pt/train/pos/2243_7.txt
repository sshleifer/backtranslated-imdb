I thought the whole movie played beautifully with new images and interesting cinematography all along the way. The actors were at the top of their characters' backs at an almost perfect time and they looked great. The music was exuberant and well thought out. He even had a decent turnaround from an ending. So what happens to everyone voting for him? The story was not entirely new (it seemed a remnant of "Running Man" with the whole idea of ​​the television show), but the attitude toward Christianity and Judaism about how the audience chooses the Messiah certainly seemed true enough. It makes sense to follow this man who was placed before a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious people identify him because the film the word "God", but this shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is teach the possibility to people who may have never seen the world so especially in the modern world where Christianity has been increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave a 7/10 stars here in IMDb. I found that every ounce of the movie was fun and original for the most part. Make sure you're not too offended to see a fun movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the modern Messiah coming to a TV near you.
