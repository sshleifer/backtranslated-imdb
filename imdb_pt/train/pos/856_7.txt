The delivery of some rough and humorous lines from Pierce Brosnan is worth the price of admission. He plays a sort of "twin brother psychopath James Bond," separated at birth, no doubt. As a man of intense success, his character is very sexual, but even better, very funny. Add the kind and super friendly American "neighbor", Greg Kinnear, to create a contrast. The myriad of locations, vivid colors and fast mood provide great entertainment. Hope Davis is well chosen as the "jewel of the world". a wife. "But the focus of the film is on the two companions, a new" Odd Couple ", and that's the part that works very well. Have a great (probably R-rated) laugh, and look at the places where the story goes a little deeper.
