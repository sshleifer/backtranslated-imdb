The name Jackie Chan is synonymous with acrobatics. This movie never lets you down. The best chase scene opening and the last scrolling pole scene is just as risky as a wonder if it knows the meaning of fear. This movie comes very close to Jackie's best which is PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars where, as in this film, Jackie carries the film entirely on her shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason that made Jackie a great martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee. What makes this movie work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable side that he hires with the typical martial arts action hero. This movie was followed by a sequel that was good but was rather bland compared to its predecessor.
