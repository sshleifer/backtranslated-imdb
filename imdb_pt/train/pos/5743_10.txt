I loved this movie! It was all I could do to keep from crying while watching, but it's really very uplifting. I was impressed by Ray Liotta's performance, but especially with the talent of Tom Hulce portraying Ray's twin brother, who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible event in childhood. But Tom's character, though heartbreaking, has no pity of its own and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it !!
