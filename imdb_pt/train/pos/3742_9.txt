I really liked this movie, but it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie was badly categorized! It is not a war film more than "A fly over the nest of cuckoos" is an asylum film or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison film. This is a film about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence, and the costs of this kind of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One flew over the Cuckoo's nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", his in good company, and maintains his own. These films should be compared and compared, not with "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". Eric
