I love this movie. As a kid, this was one of the first movies I saw that made me back down. Of course, it's mild now, but in the past it was incredible. Dentists are one thing that many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's amazing. And I always had love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly, no one could have done better. And for a low budget horror film, the effects and such are very good. And I also love theme music, it goes well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also on tapping a nosy cop and does a great job. There's a fair amount of blood and some really cool torture / death scenes. Check this one out!
