An excellent example of "cowboy noir," as it has been called, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses a job because he insists on being honest (he has a bad leg). With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he will lie. When he walks into a bar, and owner Wayne (the late JT Walsh) confuses him with a killer Wayne hired to make his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael plays along and accepts the money from Waynes. * So * he goes to Suzanne and informs about the intentions of his husbands, and accepts * his * money to get rid of Wayne! If that does not complicate things enough, the real killer, "Dallas Lyle" (Dennis Hopper in a perfect role for him) appears and Michael is even more in trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" gets a lot of the locals. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, was clever in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly secluded small town that may have seen better days and where residents could be involved in any kind of schemes. . It is also a fun idea of ​​the kind of problem an honest person could have if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation. It's an appallingly dark and twisted story with a variety of main characters who, if they're not corrupt, are at least morally committed like Michael. The lighting of director of photography Marc Reshovsky is superb in his bad mood; even the climax established in a cemetery lends a morbid quality to the whole thing. Even though writing is not particularly "logical or believable," the film has a great way to intrigue the viewer and only draw him to the right. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job at leading, but Co-stars have a great time sinking their teeth into their fleshy and ambitious characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are fun to watch in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are well as Walshs substitutes (in a particularly good tone, Walsh is also the local sheriff), and there is amusing participation for country and western star Dwight Yoakam, who also credits the film with final credits pleasant. tuning <br /> <br /> It's a good little movie that's worth checking out. It advances at an impressive pace and, if nothing else, is certainly never boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
