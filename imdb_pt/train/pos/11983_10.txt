This show has a great storyline! It's very believable! A man's wife dies and he can not take care of his children alone, so he calls his brother-in-law his best friend and many others come later in the show. As Rebeecca Donaldson, the kind but strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alex that you can find out for yourself (I do not want to ruin everything for you) and coerce Kimmy Gibler! (The DJ's helper), but the kids are wonderful too. This is Mary Kate and Ashley first took off! And also you can meet Candace Cameron Bure in shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and this is so crow! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, the loving middle child who feels left out. Really this is a really good show!
