Going to see this movie I was a bit skeptical, because fantasy films are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. Little did I know that I was on a tour through cinematic magic. Everything in the film, from the plot to the dialogue to the effects, was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines as the star she is in this movie. From beginning to end, you fall in love with this character more and more. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch committed to capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty. Robert De Niro is an adorable character who gives the audience the greatest comic relief while the movie is gaining momentum toward climax. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a film that surprised me and thrilled me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for kids and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
