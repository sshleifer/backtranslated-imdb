Most people who watched this movie think that it is the best movie of all time. I disagree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad guy and he knows he's intimidating and uses it to move on. It's about him and how he goes from dishwashing to having a huge house and an office with cocaine all over the table. If you want a family movie then this is not the way to go but if you want mafiosos and revenge and things like that then you will like it.
