Uggh! I really was not impressed with this movie, although I must admit that it is technically well done. It gets a 7 for very high production values, but as for the entertainment values, it's pretty bad. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50's. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the movie is annoying at times with so much dancing, dancing and dancing. This is because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs, plus a strong story and performance (such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this movie is almost all sung and danced. In fact, this movie has the most songs and dances in history, and if you do not like it, the movie will bore you quickly. Give me more story! As a result, with exaggerated production numbers and a weak history, this movie is like a steady diet of meringue - it just does not satisfy in the long run. To think ... this is the movie that defeated "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for Best Picture! And to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even named in this category! Even more surprising to me is that "Ace in the Hole" lost to Best Writing, Screenplay for this movie - although "An American in Paris" has almost no story to speak of and was mainly boosted by dance and music.
