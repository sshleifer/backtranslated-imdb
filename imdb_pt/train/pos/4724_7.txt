Trapped: buried alive leads us to a resort that has just opened, and is about to close. <br /> <br /> We started with a guy in the gear blowing hills, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow this does not make sense. anyway, he's about to blow a particularly big one when he realizes that the resort is open. despite his best efforts, more authority tells him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche hits. <br /> <br /> Look, I will not reveal anything else. , all I can say is that this was a B movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact of not having any commercial proof that it's a B movie) anyway, it's a decent movie, but it is partially unreal. <br /> <br /> First of all, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. not just traced by dust. or how about a CD for a screwdriver? it's not possible. and finally, what I can not emphasize enough, is that an explosion can not stop an avalanche, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is worth renting or watching television, but not owning it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie is rated PG, but maybe it should have received something a bit stronger. a boy almost loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, dead people are lying down. <br /> <br /> enjoy.
