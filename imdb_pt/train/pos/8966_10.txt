this is a wonderful film, it makes the 1950s beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and attractive as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All supporting performances are great, from Jack Lemmon to Nicky and Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico, who is working Magic in Manghattan, Elsa Lanchester as Aunt Queenie. And then there's the cat - I have no idea how many witches (besides me) called a Pyewacket cat, but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart seems out of place, but only as much as his character is out of fashion in this strange underworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending, in which we believe because the films of this vintage have these happy endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have as much chance of being happier forever as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great film)
