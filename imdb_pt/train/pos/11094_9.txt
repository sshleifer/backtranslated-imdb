This sleek and bold film delivers consistently. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily Elmore Leonard's best adaptation to date (and if you're scratching your head thinking "but I love GET SHORTY" you need to punch him in the face). In my opinion, no one picks up the "feel" of the characters of Leonard better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The transfer of Detroit's (romance) story to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to astonishing heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, Primeval City and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer movies include SECONDS and THE CANDIDATE MANCHURIAN. I also have a special place in my cold movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
