Disney may be only in something here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a truth-based story involving sports and a small town in the middle of America. Now with Quaid and The Rookie ... plus a sports story based on the truth. <br /> <br /> Both movies take you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel good after seeing them. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we hoped it was a great kind of good movie to feel. We were not disappointed, when asked if we would be buying this on DVD when leaving, it was a no-brainer. Most definitely.
