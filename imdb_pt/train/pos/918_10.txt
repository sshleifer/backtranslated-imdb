IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING A COPY OF THIS MOVIE PLEASE READ THE SEGMENT OF THIS DESCRIPTION: First broadcast on CBS on November 30, 2003, the made for TV Finding John Christmas is a continuation of the previous year, A Town Without Christmas , with Peter Falk reprise his role as versatile guardian angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a nurse divorced from a small town whose depression ... due to the fact that the hospital she keeps being forced to close because of a debt of $ 100,000 is briefly raised when she sees a photo taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The image shows an act of bravery executed by Noah's brother firefighter, Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left the city 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to return quietly to the city without explanation or fanfare, but this is impossible when Noah's newspaper releases a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there's something, very, very curious about this photo: it also shows a suit of Santa Claus apparently floating in the air without an occupant. That elusive "Santa Claus" is, of course, the angelic Max, who appears from time to time throughout history in various ways to solve problems, give advice, tie loose plots - and even share a musical duet with his talented daughter by Kathleen. Help (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> INTERESTED IN HAVING A COPY: WRITE ME HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
