Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, is a fun comedy of camp horror, in which the fourth wall is broken a few times and the jokes often lie below the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become a character of her own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a hostess of horrors, who learns that she inherited her Aunt Morgana. Then she goes to a small town of Fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrendous of the monsters that ever embraced the earth: the comedy of morality. Elviras, the booby appearance is, of course, too much for the plums, but the city's kids amuse themselves with their different kind of approach to life. And, of course, there is even more sinister evil, his Uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), which is after Elvira's mothers book of spells. See, Elvira is really a real witch, she just does not know it. Still. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, even though the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most of the laughter comes from the difference between Elvira and people of good morals, but there are some good visual jokes as well. It's okay in all directions, but it never gets to be anything more than that. In all, a good comedy intentionally exaggerated. If you like that sort of thing, that's it.
