Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the script pop. There are a few films out there that can develop a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famous meeting scene could have been much more boring with lower quality actors involved. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar moreso in Odd Couple), and with all the little idiosyncrasies and mannerisms that Matthau enters into the character (the line in which he is arguing that he is with him since he lives in the city, while Lewis lives in the country where Lewis is "out of touch" is the quintessential example of this) make this one of the best performances I have ever seen of any actor in any role, be it comedy or drama. or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work very well together; the contrast they portray accentuates Simon's excellent ability to create comic conflicts. This film is simply one of the last must-sees and demands a place of legitimate prestige in the pages of film history.
