Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors ever to appear - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions," a funny comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con cheater who gets the curriculum from a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position at a company run by Malden - with the aim of embezzlement in mind. It is not good sailing; he attracted the attention of his competitor in the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him in the place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can not keep a job and is seen throughout the film in a variety of jobs - all ending with being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov to her curry apartment as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they are meant for each other. Of course, she does not know that Ustinov is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> This is such a good movie - you can not help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius and the ways he gets out of trouble. But there's an ending that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this movie, set in the 60's in London. It's worth it if you just listen to Maggie Smith complaining, "I got fired."
