I must say that I was impressed with the cinematography was amazing, the pictures close to perfection and the way he built the tension around a subject that sounds more like a terrible boring is beyond being. <br /> <br /> The film is about two narrators, one seen, one invisible. Both are trying to explain the meaning of a series of paintings that caused a scandal a long time ago. The film is about theories and explanations of points of view, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. Definitely a movie that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes to play the plot, the film still seemed like a complete work. Fantastic direction! I must say much better than Blood of the Poet, which for some strange reason reminds me a little. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call it by the "artsy" slang. It's practically a professional conversation about various impressive theories and visual effects, but the team and Ruiz have done it. At least for me. An incredible movie.
