I liked "Nemesis", by Albert Pyun, for his tacky action and semi-complicated script. Many people complain about the "confusing" plot of the first movie, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has an idiot when the stones plot with the same super action to carry it. <br /> <br /> This gives the name of the hero of the first movie, Alex, to a joined superwoman sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good part of the film only has dialogue in an African language without subtitles, which I liked because it made it look authentic (how many times do movies like this really try to do that?). It was not long before the evil cyborgs traveled back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, this sucks (not that the first one was great). There are subplots involving Africa's political turmoil, treasure hunt, and tribal combat. The picture is too short in brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. The image is basically an extended fight with some chases that comes down to muscle-babe vs cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just do not expect quality, or anything from the first movie.
