In this film, made just as the production code was being applied, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the boy-hunting partner "Kitty". The Missouri girl begins with the girls getting on a train, with Eadie making a promise to herself to make money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole - some in the process. It does not take long to meet Frank Cousins ​​(Lewis Stone, the gentle doctor of the Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the films "Andy Hardy"), but not everything is what it seems ... The censors must have adored the Harlow line: "A girl could not accept an expensive gift like that of a gentleman, unless she was engaged." Later, someone says "You know we've never been alone" and Eadie replies "Yes, and we will not be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, superior who comes to her rescue when trouble comes to look for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares "You should rip me off your list - I'm not a ladies man" .... I wonder what that line would have been just a few years before, before the Hayes code came to town . What was he really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the high "Baby Talker" as listed in IMDb credits. It seems she was only in showbiz from 1931 - 1939, with "Munchkin" in the Wizard of Oz being the last part she played. Fun, playful cleanmp as girls chase men across the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who was a 1920 Olympic gold medalist who became a movie star (he was on many of Dr. Kildares's members and would appear in four of Harlow's films.) Misplaced identity, twists the young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in bathing suits in "Palm Beach", although the outer scenes of downtown seem to be a backdrop.
