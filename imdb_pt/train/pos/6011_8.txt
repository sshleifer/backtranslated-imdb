for my opinion, in the middle of the movie, especially the love scene is a little too long, but all the time you can imagine this feeling of the desert. but the best, what made this movie unforgettable are the great images of explosion, its color, slowmotion and pink floyd music are unique in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> destruction in its most popular and popular form.
