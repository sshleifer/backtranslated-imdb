In your video store, you can find this gem. <br /> <br /> The human condition in modern times LA. No exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that can happen to any group of individuals over time. <br /> <br /> Help you understand the joys and despair of urban life. <br /> <br /> The direction and cut are first class. Cinematography and music suit the mood and situation very well. And the CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent performance. No one out of place or out of character. <br /> <br /> And you're not really as unhappy as you would expect. I gave him 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen, DO!
