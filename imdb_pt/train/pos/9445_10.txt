This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen. The first time I saw him, I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking around a bit before the rape scene. And when I saw it I was really shocked thinking "What kind of sick movie is this?". Today I saw this from the beginning and I really understood how great this movie really is. It's exciting, scary, shocking and incomparable. But the best thing is the end where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. It will torture their consciousness and they will worry for the rest of their lives about the bodies found in that river. And there's nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This ending is one of the most unfortunate finals in movie history and very clever, brilliant and horrible. <br /> <br /> And the acting is great as well, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Magnificent acting in this movie. In all, John Boorman created one of the best movies in the history of cinema based on the novel by Dick Chaney. A must see for all movie lovers
