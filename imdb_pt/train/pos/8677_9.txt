This film seems to be well remembered as the moment when Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while, but predictably sour. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat that the two Butch the dog perform at the beginning and end of the short. I liked a lot and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
