The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being the youngest has some teenage problems, on the other hand, her sister Val has work, boyfriend, bridal problems, like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, make mistakes sometimes, but do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. The priorities of life. I loved this show a lot. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm so sad that the show is over. I still watch the reruns from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to the comedy, but she plays very well. She's one of the actresses I like to watch. I like Vince and Holly's relationship, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he shows up. With Tina Holly met a real friend and I really like them coming out. Lauren's character is so funny and she's a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I wish the show was not over.
