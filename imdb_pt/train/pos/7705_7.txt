I've seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about what I like! Science fiction films of the 1950s were a mixed pack: they were done smartly and / or thought provoking or cheese cheap and laughable. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, color. <br /> <br /> He also had an early lead with the script - though Shakespeare may not have recognized him, it was based on his timelessness. Play and thus ensure a certain longevity in itself, if well. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the murderous id of a man artificially magnified infinitely by machines of a dead race left attached 200,000 years earlier. Along the way, the plot is shivering with the stereotypes of the 50's and with the corn so pure that sometimes you wonder why you're watching, but it always does. That love triangle thing ... yuk! The Disney cartoon still holds up well, and the cartoons taken from the covers of Galaxy magazine look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car over the desert in the distance is a hoot though! <br /> <br /> All in all, with all the flaws, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine impression survives.
