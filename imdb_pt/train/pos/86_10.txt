I remember seeing it in a Salem movie theater (where I used to go to "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a kid and I never forgot that. It simply surprised me and my friends. I wish there was some way I could see it again! I tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that without success. I just recently discovered that it was a Cousteau movie and this surprised me even more. How the hell did he do that is beyond my understanding. The fish is really in the cat's mouth at one point, if I remember correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see him again I would be extremely grateful!
