"Panic" is a kind of comedic drama with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the lead roles. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people for living. But at the moment he is facing a depression and that is why he is seeing a therapist. That's where he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and he falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to leave the family business (the murders), but now he does not know how to say it to his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a guy during midlife crisis, facing the common problems: falling in love with a beautiful girl and whatever happens to it. <br /> <br /> Very good acting performances from the cast. Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this movie and it was a good movie, but it did not deliver completely. The story was pretty flat and clich√© .. <br /> <br /> 7/10
