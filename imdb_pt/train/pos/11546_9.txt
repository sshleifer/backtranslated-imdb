First screening: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Very impressive script and acting and comic timing in this movie. Now 40, he has lost none of his power. Neil Simon presents an excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedies from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play that this movie is based on. <br /> <br /> One of the best Hollywood comedies ever written and represented! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Film Editing." Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made.
