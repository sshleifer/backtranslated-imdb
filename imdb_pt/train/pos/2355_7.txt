... but I enjoyed this show anyway. I've been reading some of the reviews that previous reviewers have had to say about this program, and I'm having trouble completely overriding all the reviews in my own head (except one: that the show was obsolete; this show was ANYTHING but obsolete) . Many of the things that people discuss about this program are in money: pretentious; forced; exhausted; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; incessant narration ever present. But you know what? I really liked. It was different, it was original, really, really TRIED; and this has offset all the disadvantages. The show was brilliant, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and wait and enjoy it. I'm going to mourn your death. But I do not think anyone will bring it back to life.
