A feathery plot and dubious characterizations make no difference when a movie is as fun to watch as it is. Lively action and spectacular acrobatics - for their day - give this film a true zipper. And there's some real chemistry comedy between the two tracks. Quinn is also a good villain, although his role is completely overshadowed. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's tough role, this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie of that era. You may be able to forgive this because of the time it was made, but it is still difficult to pass. Despite all the heroism and horribly adult situations off the screen, this is still little more than a good time for teenagers.
