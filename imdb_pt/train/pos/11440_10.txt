I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today. It's the second time in two days and yes, I see films that I like as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the brilliance of the images and the work of Goldsworthy. This morning, when I threw the coins I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity for water, hence the title. I received the 5th line that changed to the 7th Army. For Blake Art it was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few online reviews of the SF Examiner online. The critic adored the film, but said that Goldsworthy's comments disrupted his pleasure in the film. He would rather have just the pictures and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware of this while watching the second time around. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well, today I could stand a little beyond the pictures and hear what he had to say. Could I enjoy the movie without your comments? What he is doing, what he is saying goes far beyond "art." His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change and so on made me think that man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of your works / words are like Zen. Your knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Either way, the film is only (apparently) shown here in the Bay Area. Be a trendsetter. Go to your local cinema and tell them, do not insist that they have to book a movie that you've heard about the inland lands. It's called rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
