A thief in the night has to be the best of all thrillers at the end of time. I have no idea what people are complaining about what people are complaining about when they say that these movies scared them to accept God. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night. Do not listen! These films speak not only of one of the many possibilities of tribulation, but are also fun to watch in its simplicity. They are in fact low budget and this is a bit obvious, but it is not very obvious at first viewing. I had no idea why I actually assumed that many movies like those made in the '70s included low budgets all the time. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of the young, cynical Patty Myers who lives for what comes her way, until her husband and almost all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture that everyone he warned her. At first, the film is not based around it until the rapture happens. What this leads to show is that everyone around you is becoming Christian and believing in Christ, which is usually what happens to many people. Everyone around you who once knew and loved will be gone forever, and the one left behind is the one who blames everyone but himself. No one can blame themselves because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Just like those whiners who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I'm thirteen and you do not see me whining, especially since I was just like Patty before I once again accepted Christ in my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything thrown in a Christian movie instead of typical stereo, everyone is a wrong movie, than you will like A Thief In The Night. Do not knock before you try. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
