In Micro Phonies, the puppets are there. In this short trio, the workers are working in a recording studio. They end up taking a look at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing the voice of spring. The voice is incredible. Curly in drag is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cockroach. The three clowns end up going to the party where Curly will dress in teasing. They play a record of the voices of spring and everything is going well until Moe destroys the disc in Curly's head. They end up using lucia's sextile until the baritone recognizes them and unplug them. Alice Van Doren grabs the boy and shouts behind a curtain to help them. All is well until the baritone wondering how Curly is singing without the help of a phonograph finds Alice behind the curtain. The three clowns are revealed to be frauds, but Alice's father discovers her daughter's talent and agrees she should become a singer. The stooge is thrown out of the room. Great.
