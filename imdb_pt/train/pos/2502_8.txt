This movie surprised me! Never having heard of Hyde de Gackt, I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because someone mentioned that the movie contained some serious action footage in the John Woo style! I'm usually very careful when it's claimed! There is only one John Woo and to this day there has not been a director who came close to his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" would have a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with gun vampires! Looks promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie is that the pace was pretty slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie contains some nice Hong Kong-style action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship to each other! The pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job at acting and are very believable as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to jump! Example: When a gang member dies (very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking blood from one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the movie skips nine years and most of the friends are no longer together! Also without proper reason, since Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill themselves! I know this is meant to add some serious drama! Because of the actors is very effective, but sometimes it seems forced! In addition to the flaws in the plot, this film has an ambiance and elegance that makes it hard not to like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But that's all! The overall experience you receive is moving and sincere!
