I think this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And then I really love this movie. Especially I like all of SdA's perfect superheroes to be so perfect and disrespectfully parodyed. The brightest is the counterpart of Gandalf (the brave, wise and completely without humor who knows everything): Almghandi, cowardice and brain-dead transvestite. Sauron's counterpart ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) is wearing only a bucket with eye holes like a helmet. Aragorn's alter ego is still another accident-prone idiot trying to mend his broken sword ("Ulrike", the legend) with duct tape. And "Strunzdumm" (the counterpart of Wormtong) does indeed bear some resemblance to Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
