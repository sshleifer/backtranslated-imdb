I really liked this movie and came back to see it twice more in a week. <br /> <br /> Ms. Detmers preached performance - she was like a hungry cat lurking, playing with its prey. She attacks with anger and lust, picking up a "very young" mistress and dropping hundreds of pieces of fine china from her terrorist fiance on the floor. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of beautiful touches. The Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I particularly enjoyed the old Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'. He had a sense of 'Story of O' - that is, where the media people indulged in a rampant sexual adventure. As she walks through the fantastic apartment on the chandelier, she is comfortable - and why not, what is to contain a "devil in the flesh"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real treat!
