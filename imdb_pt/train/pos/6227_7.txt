Definitely one of the smaller Astaire / Rogers musicals. It is just very poorly drawn and stimulated. It only works a few minutes longer than the Swing Time, for example, but it seems much more time-consuming. This is due in part to the minor romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She's sweet and I love at least one of her songs, "But Where Are You?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan," her other number, is a weak leftover from Cartola, fortunately cut from that masterpiece). Follow the Fleet would really be a bad movie if it were not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance contest contests the first place of any number. The dance is simply fantastic. "I'm putting all my eggs in a basket" features the two rehearsals for a dance that they have not yet perfected. Your imperfections make everything more perfect. And "Let's Face Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So the film is worth watching for its great moments.
