Elvira Mistress of the Dark is just that, an exaggerated mix of fun, sex appeal, horror and comedy, all dumped into a low cut black dress and topped by a black bouffant black hairstyle high in the sky. This movie is sure to delight any fan of Elvira. It takes you up close and personal with Elvira and probes deep within her ... a past revealing her enormous ... ancestry. <br /> <br /> The movie takes you on a walk with Elvira while she goes from the TV Hostess Horror with Mostess in her hometown of Fallwell Mass to claim her inheritance from a late great-aunt. Where she finds a muted city, a movie owner, a scary great-uncle who seems to be behind her for more than her good looks. A series of high school kids who love her immediately, and a city council that will do anything to get her out of town, even if it means burning her at the stake! Watch Elvira woo the children, chase the stallion, avoid her creepy great-uncle, and stick her nose in the tense, dirty 'conservatives' who have no kind words for her in Elvira Mistress of the Dark! Elvira would say "I guarantee it's going to be a scream!" (Screams in the background) Wow! Glad I did not say it would be a gas!
