This film makes no pretentious efforts to conceal its true genre - an exaggerated B movie. He will tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this movie in ways that make you go, "Hmmmmm ... this is so stupid!" and then you're laughing. For example, there is a scene in the "16th Century Japan" which shows some samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. At the bottom of the temple, there are several tourists looking afar in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent to bearable, oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You'll see some decent actors and then you'll find others really awful. I have to do a little digression because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she's amazing. His air time in the movie was very short though. I also saw Bryan Yamasaki in various plays on the islands during my visits and he is also better at the theater than in this movie. Either way, it's a fun movie if you have nothing to do on a Monday night to Friday night.
