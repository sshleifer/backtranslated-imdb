And one made for the TV movie too, this movie was good. the acting on it and the plot was great. This is one of the only movies I saw that I felt that bothered me because after seeing it, I was afraid that Reaper would kill me through the screen of my computer. There were only a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it's a lot easier to look at. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr did an excellent part in this film along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie has so much suspense and made me want more because I never thought a low budget movie could be so powerful. After seeing this I read the novel that this movie was based on (four times) and also kicked it was great. If you see this movie appear on TV, I watch. The effects in this movie were very well done, I honestly do not know what a live calcifying human would look like, but with the way the FX team made this film I was impressed and all it shows is that all of this was bad for TV out there with low budgets should not be that bad. <br /> <br /> Watch. It's very good, is not it!
