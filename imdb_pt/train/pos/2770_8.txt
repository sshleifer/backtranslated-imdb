Watching David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get your Bible lesson going to Sunday school. Despite a script that is sometimes funny without wanting it, the movie is a lot of fun. The studio system had its flaws, but spared no expense when a prodigious production was requested. Peck portrays King David as a lustful but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murdering a sexy Bath-Sheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan makes his usual and fierce presentation. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young man Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
