I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Hard to believe that this is the debut in Mrs. Blom's direction, it's beautifully paced and performed. A large cast of characters could be out of a novel by Anne Tyler, meaning they are filled with potential stories and futures, no fake notes, surprising mood swings amid self-inflicted anxiety and very real dilemmas if not terrible. If you've seen "The Best of Youth," you'll recognize how well the characters are attracted through small moments, even as the story progresses quickly. I really hope this is distributed in the US. I live in a very sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish films of any kind.
