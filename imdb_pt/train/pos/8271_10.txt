One of the greatest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama featuring scenes of regatta and football that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a star. He is patented by Haines all the way: daring aleck intelligent who takes nothing seriously until he is rejected by all, becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. No one worked this formula like Haines. A great comic actor (Little Annie Rooney, with Mary Pickford, Show People, with Marion Davies), Haines could move from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. He is a total joy in this movie, as he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as the girl, Jack Pickford is very good as the sick roommate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton co-star. This film is now known for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for being John Wayne's first movie as a Yale footballer (but I've never seen him). Haines was one of the five biggest box office stars since 1932. It's a shame he's been forgotten and most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
