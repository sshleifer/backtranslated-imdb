After watching this movie last night at Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was first made in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the media idea being the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed videotape, instead we have a haunted studio and strange images appearing in the movie. In fact, the strange images that appear in the film immediately bring to mind the damn RINGU videotape. The only thing missing was the obsession with water that runs through Nakata's later films. The final scenes are quite chilling, with a slight nod to Murnau, who with the door opening alone and the ghost entering the room, reminds me immediately of NURSERATU. A creepy movie that will make you think twice before climbing the catwalk.
