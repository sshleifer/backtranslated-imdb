Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry, the mouse, Kelly dancing with Sharon McManus, 7, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi leading and much more. The Technicolor is perfect with some innovative camera work, such as watching a piano played underneath, through transparent keys and Grayson corner, seen through the finder of another camera. The plot is fine, but you get involved with the enthusiasm of Kelly and Sinatra. Seaman's license, they have to take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls in love with his aunt. To hire him with his aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this, and in his own words sung he falls in love very fast. While trying to get in touch with Iturbi, who is never available, he begins to fall in love with another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly's love is now falling with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is best remembered for the combination of live action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there is much more here that is worth taking a look at. I'm giving nine stars because although it's not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - is one of the first in its class of great Technicolor productions (maybe Meet Me In St. Louis was the first) and better than most others.
