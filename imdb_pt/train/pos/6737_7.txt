The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) have returned to this solid police force: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a police officer to sever all ties with the past, but can not control his violent methods while interrogating suspects, and a night, it goes too far; Gene Tierney is the distant wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who became involved with the city squad leader and Andrews best enemy Gary Merrill (who had been Andrews Snr's protege)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted film with a remarkable opening credits sequence and animated by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews senior owner), Tom Tully (as the father of Tierney's taxi driver) and Neville Brand (as the main villain of Merrill), with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens (as the squeaky and beating victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews 'sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' ). Having already been warned by the latter to correct his ways or else, Andrews panics and passes by Stevens for a few hours after his murder to put the police in the (in this case) wrong way of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (when Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes alone in Merrill's lair with the intention of being expelled and "framing" the criminal for his own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews faces the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the Fox noir style of the house.
