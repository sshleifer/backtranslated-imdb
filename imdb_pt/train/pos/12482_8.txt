I did not read anything but good things about this movie and finally got a chance to watch it late last night and it was all I hoped it was and more. That's the way a horror movie should be. scary was because it was so realistic. The scary soundtrack was perfect for setting a gloomy mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the film unfolded. It was very easy to follow and understand, unlike some movies that are too complicated. I would love to see more horror movies like this.This is easily one of my favorites.A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have created a nice atmosphere for this movie.Another then that had all elements good horror film needs.I recommend this movie for anyone who can enjoy a good horror movie that does not make any punches.I'll add it to my collection.The DVD has some interesting special features.
