"My son, my sister, dream <br /> <br /> How sweet all things would seem <br /> <br /> We went on this earth to live together, <br /> <br /> And there love slow and <br /> <br /> There's love and dies between <br /> <br /> Those scenes that you image, that sumptuous time. <br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> <br /> Based on Elizabeth Von Arnim's novel, "Enchanted April" can be described in one sentence ?? occurs in the early 1920s when four London women and four foreigners decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It's the correct description, but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - a "feel good" movie is the perfection of its genre. Beautiful and sunny, tender and peaceful, gentle and magical, it's like a ray of sunshine on your face during the spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and enjoy it forever. This is the movie that really affected my life. I watched during the hard times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and accept an unflattering truth about myself. This helped me regain my optimism and the hope that everything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised myself that no matter what it was, I would withdraw from misery and self-pity and enjoy every minute of my life - with its joy and its sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later That year I did and I was not alone. Enchanted April is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of the highest quality.
