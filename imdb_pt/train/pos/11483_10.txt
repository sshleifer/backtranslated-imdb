What makes this movie so scary is the way it portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal subjects. Definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers, since they have fun in front of the camera, forgetting script lines, etc. They are just making the video as a journal to show survivors how normal their lives were. His parents just think the guys are filming for a homemade video. Searching other children attacks on their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what not to do and they tell (usually a silly way like "This Old House") any potential "Andres and Calvins" who might be watching this video how to make bombs, get weapons and do not get caught before Day Zero (the day of the attack).
