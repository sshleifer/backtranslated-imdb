Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When beautiful Kee Nang enters her life, she tells him that he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Skeptical and driven only by lust and intrigue, Jarrell engages himself without realizing that he is about to embark on a fantastic journey involving the danger and, worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is the Golden Child a product of its time?, by that I mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity unique to the late 1980's? For I can vividly recall how much this movie amused people in that decade, its box office was $ 79,817,937, becoming the eighth largest winner of 1986, but since the 1980s it has disappeared from memory, it has become the thing to deny the Eddie Murphy comedy accolades that they actually had once. The Golden Child is not with the most accepted films of the 80s like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but when revisiting the film recently I personally discovered that it contains Murphy at his best, serious and charming! Invading a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by the Lost Ark Hunters in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the necessary gender buttons. Beautiful girl, daringly reluctant-hero with a joke in her arsenal, bold villain {Charles Dance so English I could kiss him myself}, wonderful color and a handsome boy with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in fun, not to dissect and digress its value as a skull fantasy image. Yes, the CGI demon looks now, and yes, the genre had much better pictures in the 80's, 90's and beyond, but really if you agree to the shameful rating of 5 here on this site then you might be catching that genre a bit too serious serious. 7/10
