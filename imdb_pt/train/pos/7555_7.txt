Gender Bender has sex for the x files a bit. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an ending that is missing. Gender Bender is also the x-files debut of actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of "The Kindred". You need to see this episode just to see the less spectacular start of Nic Lea. An interesting thing about the vampire's "power of seduction." When Marty does this to his victims, they become turned to him / her. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she is just disoriented and groggy, and is not attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience of it than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it would sometimes be horrible to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode it is so damp, soggy and muddy that it could not have been so much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
