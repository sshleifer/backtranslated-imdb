Idiot hackers, a baby, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add everything and you'll have the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with the power of a list of stars (at least-less ... ok, b-plus?) this movie has little publicity. <br /> <br /> But that does not diminish your genius. <br /> <br /> Fantastic writing, solid delivery and a group of compelling characters. Some truly classic lines, and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are lowlife thugs. They talk bad about low life and do bad things for the young. But they do it for fun and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
