The fleet was launched in 1936, in the midst of depression, when people were struggling all over the world, finding jobs or even finding food to put on the table. In Europe, Hitler was on the rise, along with other works of nationalists / socialists. In the United States, Cartel seeds sown with the Federal Reserve Act and the income tax amendment (16) were beginning to bear fruit for the connected financial capitalists and their dominant secret societies. <br /> <br /> For the average guy and girl, times were difficult. You enter Hollywood with at least some hopeful images - I do not think we can call them propaganda at this point, although this particular movie revolves around naval exercises leading up to the war. The real question for boys and girls, then, as now, was how to connect with the right path, lead a decent life, have wonderful children with a minimum of grace and elegance. <br /> <br /> The odds were long. <br /> <br /> For my full review of this movie and for other movie reviews and books, please visit my website TheCoffeeCoaster.com. <br /> <br /> Brian Wright Copyright 2007
