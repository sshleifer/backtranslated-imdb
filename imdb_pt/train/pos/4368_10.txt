This is a very exciting and romantic film. I've seen it several times and I never get tired of it. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> In fact, I prefer this film to Braveheart, since Braveheart contains so many historical errors. There are many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene. This is really good and amazing scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful ... it really suits the movie. The scenery is incredible.
