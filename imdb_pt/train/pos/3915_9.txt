I've seen this movie at least 4 times since 1984 and it's still great every time I see it. It is a very attractive version of the opera Carmen, with incredible flamenco dance, skeletal sets and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This narrative of Carmen is a story within a story, with every other parallelism, to the end doubly tragic. Obviously, a Spanish production of low budget, the film contains dances of some of the best Spanish dancers of Spain. The combination of opera music and the sound of dancers' boots on the wooden stage makes the storytelling even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Independent cinema is the best and probably the all time favorite. foreign film
