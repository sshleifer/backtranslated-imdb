It's a good thing that I rented the movie before seeing the viewer's rating of this site. It was a wonderful film that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast has been beautifully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role. I would tell viewers that they have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it. I rate it up there with the Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well. The things he says and does is how I would imagine a person with a lot of money to take action. The movie is much funnier than Santa Claus and Christmas with the Kranks. In addition, he has a good story and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, which is that you can not buy love with money.
