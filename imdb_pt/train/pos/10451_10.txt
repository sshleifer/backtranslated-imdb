"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my 5 favorite movies of all time. Dialogue and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course the romantic Vienna introduced in the film does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and you can not reach everywhere in just one night, or (especially if you are a strange and its your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although nothing really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm a bit skeptical about the sequel that will be released in the summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
