"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team called SG-1 through a device called Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> Having seen this series sporadically for its first few seasons when it came out, I did not know how good it would be this series, 10 years after having seen an episode for the last time. My old impression was that the show was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a science fiction series, it is one of the best-produced, interesting, long-lasting and exciting sci-fi ever produced. It's because? Because it works with an incredible premise. <br /> <br /> The value of this series far outweighs that of the movie it was based on and I think it's a great example of how television as a medium with a proper premise is capable of providing something does not work on the movie time constraint. The sense of familiarity created by a long series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing over time is impressive and only increases the ability to suspend disbelief, and is all a result of excellent writing and a lot of dedication on the part of all members of the team. the show. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" continued to offer great adventures over the course of 10 years but was never afraid of the challenge of changing the plot and gave way to some very different periods of time from the show: The first seasons, perhaps up to 4th / 5th, focused much more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes unrelated to each other, were it not for the imminent threat of Goaul. <br /> <br /> From day 5 to day 7, there were more and more episodes focused on fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After these seasons, the exploration of the planets was almost an excuse to put sg-1 in a place of conflict between Goaul and replicators / ori. <br /> <br /> - The eighth season is probably the most mestizo. It has a stream of episodes that includes smaller subjects on Earth, in which the star portal is rarely mentioned, but the last few episodes present some great replicating moments. <br /> <br /> - Days 9 and 10 travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil. Both are good continuations, although the first episodes of season 10 are a bit weak because they appear to be little more than SG-1 and human / Jaffa losing battle after battle for the Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically after the 7th season, exploration was pushed to the bottom, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery of each planet (episode) presented; On the other hand, he made for so many major episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the nature change of the show still worked and shows how big and bold the writers were. <br /> <br /> Even hard I believe the series have a high quality end that puts you well to rest, the feeling I have is that it can continue; the people involved were great professionals and the narrative of the series had a lot to offer. One last season returning to the initial nature of the series was very doable and would have been very welcome, but in the end things are as they are. <br /> <br /> In the end, because of the fact that I liked everything, it's a bit difficult to find that it ends. The overall picture, however, drawn by the work of hundreds of people over 10 years, is a vision of beauty and a true testimony to the dedication of the crew, these prominent actors and the characters we will always remember as a collective by name of SG-1.
