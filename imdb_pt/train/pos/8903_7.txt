Of course, it's a special 1950's drive-in, but do not let that fool you. In my little book, there are a series of smart touches with unexpected moods. Take the fearsome Mrs. Porter who should keep an eye on the doctor's place. It not only steals the scene, but close to the whole movie. And where did these indie producers get the coloring movies, a wise decision, since the blob would not look good in black and white. Yes, the result is jagged at the edges as the number of illustrative errors. But with the exception of several teenagers, the non-Hollywood cast performs well. So, too, the drift between the hot-rodders and the cops seems so lively and fun. Very good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive way at a time when the screen was full of "juvenile delinquents." Then again, the 27-year-old McQueen hardly qualifies in the old department, but in any case manages the hot rodder's attitude. The film was a success at the time, helped, no doubt, by the captivating tune of the title that won much of the radio. And with the exception of the unfortunate end effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or non-drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the bubble to come back now that the polar cap is turning, say, into the water in the refrigerator.
