Why is this so low? I really do not understand ... Is it because of bad acting? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about such things in low-budget horror movies? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in these films. People who hate movies just because of bad acting and bad dialogs should not be allowed to rate low-budget cheap movies. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is really bad (most of the time it's just animal bowels placed on the body of the actors and that's bad) but I do not really care because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the acting is hilarious (poor performance is a good thing in low budget horror movies), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a good thing in low budget horror movies), the zombie rapist with a huge paw is hilarious, the baby flying demon is hilarious and I could continue and continue but I do not want to talk too much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene where a girl masturbates a sex doll as if she were I live, lol! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> The best speeches of the film: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * sniffs cocaine * Detective Sloane: What * beep are you doing, Manners? What the hell did you snort? What the hell is that? Detective Manners: It's nothing expensive, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... Detective Manners: * Injects heroin into his arm * Detective Sloane: What the beep * is doing, manners? Are you insane? Detective Manners: It's a cold remedy. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac was rambling on demons and then he started banging his head on the rock! He just started banging his head on the rock! I think he's in PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
