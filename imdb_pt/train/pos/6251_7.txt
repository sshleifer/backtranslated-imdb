It's nothing shiny, innovative or innovative, but 'Dog Days' is, for some reason, a study of extremely fascinating character. It's like CRASH stumbles on a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It is an Austrian film that follows the lives of several depressed, disturbed and irritating people and their abusive relationships with each other. It's disturbing, but very well-played and it's interesting to watch the little crazy things these characters do. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation in the end, we just see the life of these sordid individuals over the course of two days.
