I had to give this movie a 10 simply because it did what so many films released in black audiences FAILED MISERLY to do. This movie was nullified from all cliches of video prostitutes, and also ignored the gangsters, rappers and foul language. He examined various relationships between doctors, African-Americans and African-American male / female romantic relationships on a whole new and refreshing level. I was highly impressed by the careful mixing of light humor with some very difficult and heavy problems. The movie will make you happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this movie reaches a much larger audience. Blacks (and everyone else) would love a movie like that - if the industry was SMART enough to put them out there! <br /> <br /> As an extra - if you are a doctor, resident, medical student, a pre-doctoral student, married to a doctor, have a medical brother, have a family doctor or know a great medical period - they would love this movie too. He portrayed the residence and practice in a realistic manner that was greatly appreciated by the doctors, residents and medical students who attended the film. Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine, so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and this is very apparent.
