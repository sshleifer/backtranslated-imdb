It's time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent move, but this film is not the only one. His other films of a generation ago were Ben Hur, the ten commandos, Omega Man and Planet of the Apes were his best works. <br /> <br /> This film made in 1973 attempts to prophesy a future land in 2022, This is so overpopulated that the human race was manipulated by the authorities to eat a universally produced food product called "Soylent Green" which is manufactured with human flesh. This bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its launch as it is now and assumes the population of India, which would be about 2 billion by that stage would then be meat eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston character supplanting the secret international conspiracy that the world powers invented to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation using cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for the producers of this film, the green message they convey is not the Green Party of today's ethos. Thank God. Cannibalism was practiced by indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until just 40 years before this film was made, but was abandoned long ago by human civilization. Another silly prediction in the movie is that women become sex slaves almost turning the tide of radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 when this movie was made. <br /> <br /> The film was stupid and is so silly now, but it contains a very memorable last film. performance of the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but there is still no valid reason to revisit the film, except for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a movie failure and I would not even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews in this film that I've read all sound the same, referring to a dystopian society in the future, of which the centralized theme seems to involve only the US, in which an ecological disaster occurred. <br /> <br /> The only merit of the film is that the earth faces overpopulation.
