Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty things than any other channel, this show was certainly a bummer. The host of this sometimes coarse adult chat show, winner of the BAFTA Four-time and British Comedy Award winner (also twice nominated), Graham Norton, was the perfect gay host for a good show like this. There were one or more famous celebrities in her midst. They basically had an adult idea that would either disgust, humiliate or humor the guest, but some are not for the faint of heart. They had women playing the tape recorder with their parts, men using their sticks to play a xylophone, women in the bath, men with or without pants under their kilts, and many other crude but hilarious ideas. This is for adults only, but enjoy! He won BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment Program (or Series), won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show, won an Emmy for episode # 18 (?), And won the National Television Awards twice for the Most Popular Talk Show. It was number 52 in The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!
