Carol, the young woman at the center of the story, is transplanted to a foreign land, Spain, at the height of the Civil War conflict in the late 1930s. For this girl, everything is new in its strangeness. The war and her father are her constant concerns as she has to plunge into a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York. <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this film by the numbers. Carol's family is obviously split, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is an air force pilot with the left faction, the rest of the family is in solidarity with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story does not add anything to what has been said, much better, but it is an easy movie to watch. The magnificent landscape of northern Spain is shown. Do not expect much action, since most of what happens is around Carol and the boys she befriends. <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is the mother of Carol, Aurora, the one who left for America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who becomes friends with Carol. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left behind when he left for America. This actor, who usually has leading roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, since he remains a conundrum throughout the film.
