"The Mother" is a strange, low-budget film, playing at least two uncomfortable, often unexplored themes in the movies: denying the mother's love for her own son and daughter, and lust and old-age passion. <br /> <br /> The characters are horrible: May is a disgusting old woman and I believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sadness for her. She confesses that she did not love her son and daughter. She cheated on her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals his daughter's beloved man, not to protect her from a morbid guy who does not love her, but only because she feels aroused by him. She is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's illusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life as she is. His brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists on having his store, a terrible deal indeed. Darren is an amoral addict idiot who dislikes no one, not even himself. <br /> <br /> The acting and direction are excellent: the actresses and the actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Re-Start"
