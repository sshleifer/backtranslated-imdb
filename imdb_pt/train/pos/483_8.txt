very few chess films have been made in the last two years, but this is more than a chess film, it is a story about the need to be loved and the need to conquer it, John Toturro plays a man with psychological problems, nothing it matters to him to accept 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates him as a person, when he loses a game he loses the only thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful way, even the love of a woman does not was enough to save him from his sad existence. This makes you wonder if there is another Luzon out there who is obsessed with the game, I'm sure they are, if you are a chess enthusiast it will not hurt to see it. properly arranged and well executed, achieves its objectives, unfortunately I doubt there is a sequel.
