I've seen this movie being addicted to Jane Austen and always feeling dubious about the cinematic interpretation of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, diplomatic, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect! "Emma" is one of Austen's most charming and funny novels, thanks to the general irony of situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element (Miss Bates, above all). What has involved me in the novel, and the film makes it clear, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist, and the modern look with which women, men and their relationships are treated, and it is amazing if we think of a woman novelist of the eighteenth century, who lived almost an isolated life, could grasp such depth and truth about life as she: what fascinates me most and still fascinates me. We can feel this modernity throughout the film: just replace the costumes and use more current language, but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or the insinuating envy that governs women's relations today, and still the difficulty in revealing and expressing feelings, especially love: every situation gains a universal meaning and out of itself. value of time. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited for this role (currently she would probably be too mature for that), Toni Colette is just great. And how I envied them by the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the stunning English countryside, where every situation has a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a really nice and deserving movie.
