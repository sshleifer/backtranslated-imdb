The three main characters are very well portrayed, especially An√≠sio, from the rocker who became the first actor Paulo Miklos. It is extremely convincing as a low class invader / invader. The film very well shows the snowball effect of getting involved in increasingly obscure businesses, the contrast and the similarities between the lower and higher classes. As everyone gets carried away by greed and greed. 9-9.5 out of 10.
