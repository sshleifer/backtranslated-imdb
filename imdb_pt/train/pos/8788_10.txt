Well, I'm very happy to hear a rumor that this can finally be released on DVD. When that happens, I do not know, but I'll grab it when it's released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when the ring career of "Gentleman Jim" Corbett begins in the film. So it goes from a good movie to a great movie. <br /> <br /> Few people can play arrogant men and still become a cool guy and Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example of that. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe it. You can just feel how much fun he was having here. Ward Bond also seems that he was really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, has never been better. <br /> <br /> There are just the right amount of action boxing scenes here and they are very well done as well. Corbett's family is also fun to watch while they remain in the stands during Jim's matches. Outside the arena, the constant arguments and cries of Corbett's family may get a little too loud and annoying, but they set the stage for proper conclusion. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the great The fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some petty critics (Variety, for example) did not like that ending or the fact that much of the film is fictionalized, but - duh - most films are fictionalized whether we like it or not. And in this case, it was a good story and a good ending. (In real life, Corbett was a true gentleman with a soft-spoken, unlike Flynn's portrait, but Flynn still makes him a nice guy.) This is one of the classic funniest movies I I have already watched and anxiously await the DVD.
