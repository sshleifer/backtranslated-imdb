This film, despite being more than 70 years old, is still a very moving and strong film. Bette Davis, as Cockney's sucker and cockney waitress, Mildred, is absolutely believable. Watching her performance is still fascinating. It makes the viewer absolutely despise it and pity her at the same time. The performance of Leslie Howard as the weak and obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I do not see how any actor could defend himself from Davis's acting. She chews the scene in every scene she is in, totally stealing the show. This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Oscars, but lost. It was shocking to the day with themes of unmarried pregnancy, multiple sexual partners and the cruel language of Mildred, so it's a bit dated, but still a great movie. Just to see the scene in which Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him ("You cad, dirty swine ...") is still one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in the movies.
