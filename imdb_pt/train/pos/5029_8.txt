I got into this movie maybe a little tired of the rampant hack and slash movies on the screen these days. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly strolled with a dark and gloomy atmosphere. Even more surprising was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. As with most good movies, this leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a great job in directing. Scenes made inside the car are well done, and after watching the episode "Anatomy of a Scene" at the end of the video, it was nice to see that some of the subtle but wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just a kind of "Oh, that sounds good, keep it." This is a snappy movie, full of cruelty. Still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion is filmed in daylight, even some of the most disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (Okay, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never surpasses the top. Au Contraire, is very moderate, which works very well for this type of film. If there is any area where this movie is missing, it is at the end, which seems a bit invented, but still works at a simpler level without destroying the mood or message of the movie. What is the message? It is something that each individual decides for himself. Overall, on the scale of 1 to 10, this film marks an 8th for those who like the southern gothic genre (ie, "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and about 5 for whom t .
