Another comment about this movie made it look bad. The spoken images were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and cool. She still had not found her own style we had expected. However, it's great to see her this way - still learning the trade. <br /> <br /> So many clich√©s came from this film and it seems that this movie has opened up a few ways for the next 70 years. My vote is to see and remember how young this type of movie was. Keep an open mind and you might be shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we see the early part of the last century as tense ... I love this and hope you make your own opinion on this was not influenced by other negative reviews and a note.
