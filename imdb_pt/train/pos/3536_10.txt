EA has shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the world of the 60's. The graphics of the game are excellent and also the voice recording is very professional. I received this game in April 2007 (two years after launch) and am still impressed with the gameplay. It's a shame that EA does not do more games 007. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 to the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game to anyone from 13 years of age. The only thing I did not like in the game is the level of the Russian boat, it was a lot of pressure. Overall I like the game A LOT !!
