I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The film is a diamond among embers during this time. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without fail. This movie should have made them stars. What a shame in the studio for not putting everything they had behind that movie. It could easily have been a franchise. DVD release is a must and a worthy remake would relive this movie. Look for it in your TV guide and, if you see it listed, no matter how late it may be, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). This is going to break you. Times have changed drastically since those days, or at least we like to think so.
