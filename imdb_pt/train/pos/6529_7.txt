I was forced to see this because: a) I have an 11 year old girl and b) we showed her the Nacy Drew films of Bonita Granville from the 1930s, which she liked very much. Personally, I did not think it was as funny as the movies of the 1930s, but on the other hand, it was not the nauseating sense of insulting insult I feared it was. It was a harmless and slightly fun movie. Although I'm glad they did not try to "update" Nancy to the "hip hop" of the 21st century (Veronica Mars holds the title of Modern Nancy Drew), I think they made her a little bland, that they did not do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the film could have been titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with what they had to work on. I liked Emma Roberts in that role, but they gave her a script for the TV, not for the theater, script ...
