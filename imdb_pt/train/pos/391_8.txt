"Zu: The Warriors of the Magic Mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You would never have imagined it was made in 1983. The use of Tsui Hark's special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued to do this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now, he can measure up to other such films. "Legend of Zu" is linked to "Zu" warriors of the magic mountain "It is not necessary to have seen this film to understand the plot of this. It's all about action and adventure! I was always wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on the CGI. Now we know, he made this movie. Maybe it's sometimes too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I will not be critical about it. There's so much going on on the screen, you just will not believe it! I think it's a great pity that this movie was not shown in theaters here in Holland. movie is screaming for screen time in theaters! This movie can easily hit big budget Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is the lack of humor! In most Tsui Harks movies he combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor. Somehow it's missing in this movie. Again I will not be demanding ut these small issues. "Legend of Zu" offers the action front with the most beautiful special effects you'll see. A real classic!
