Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, tearful and sentimental crap you could find, but actually it's a lot better than you might expect. The foolishness of the plot could have easily set the tone for the entire movie, but in fact in most other departments the movie is charming. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Purchased by a girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder during speech-language classes and ends up becoming a super-smart speaker. However, Paulie is sent away by the girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from NYC to Los Angeles to join her. <br /> <br /> So why does this horrible movie sound do relatively well? First of all, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Second (and much more significantly) he has the courage to embrace his ridiculous premise and tell a genuinely moving, often comical, story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws of the plot. Thirdly, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a sneaky con man, Gena Rowlands as an old lady and Cheech Marin (yes, the Cheech Marin smoking) as a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.
