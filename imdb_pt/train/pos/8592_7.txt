Good for one night entertainment - but the plot was not convincing. Garrison's case with the first lady was unreal and unenthusiastic; the president was a cardboard cutout. And who were the real villains? Nothing was developed or explained enough. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. The villains were anonymous and underdeveloped, so you never felt involved in your plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - persecution and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were unbelievable in their roles, Basinger totally lacked character and no Longoria could be a Secret Service agent. This could have been a very good movie, but somehow lost the way with many unanswered questions. Disappointing overall, despite some very good scenes. And did they use the 'West Wing' set for the White House scenes? "I always expected CJ or Charlie to show up!"
