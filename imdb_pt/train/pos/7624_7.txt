A memorable film of the killing variety of animals, specifically similar to "Willard", in that it is played by an elderly actor character (in this case, a step down to the level of Les Tremayne, which puts the only distinct performance I I saw him give) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who later decides to use his animal friends to take revenge on those who have harmed him. Yes, this is one of those movies where practically everyone is despicable, so you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. it could not be better to give the film an atmosphere of decaying decay. Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender," and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the film: a snake collector who is obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When the local preacher represses his practice of collecting small animals from the local school children as bait for his snakes, and his friend marries a stripper (thus disturbing his concert ritual Wednesday night), he panics, in the process. creating a memorable pile of clunkers under the cliff where he dumps the wreckage after discarding his unfortunate owners. A fun game you can play while watching "Snakes" is placing bets where cars will land farther on the cliff. <br /> <br /> All in all, very cheap and scary, but it will really be a lot of fun for fans of these types of movies.
