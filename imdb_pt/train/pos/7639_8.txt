Not a great movie. The acting is not incredible (some sub charter are even misunderstood). The movie is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this is not for you. still has a great deal - a lot more in history. Larry's story works because we know this story of our own lives. The girl we did not ask for a date, the test we failed, the friend we disappoint, are all in our story. This movie works because it plays, it's a great story because it's small. It is the life we ​​all have, with regrets we all have, and yet the message arrives: all the lives we could have lived would have their drawbacks. The first time I watched, I was 15 years old. It was shown at a party at my school. 16 years later, I keep reflecting on it from time to time, and every time I see him, he puts a smile on my face. Watch. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
