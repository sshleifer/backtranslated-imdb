Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers' popular novel is not without its part of controversy. When the first members released from the black community criticized the treatment of black men, others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black girl named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two sons by the abusive father who are torn from his arms at birth. His only consolation in his miserable life comes from his sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played years later by rookie Whoopie Goldberg) is married to a violent husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by his sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie's life. <br /> <br /> The story is touching when Celie keeps hoping that one day she will be able to reunite with her sister and her children. Throughout her life, she encounters a variety of characters, including Sophia, a tough-as-nail wife for her stepson, and Shug, a tall, delicious bar singer who teaches her a thing or two about love. <br />> Speilberg's direction is everywhere in this photo, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved! The Color Purple film captures the essence of what is a complicated story. While this tends to minimize the lesbian aspects as well as African history, both of which were so vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing Alice Walker's voice to shine. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to respond to the controversy surrounding this movie. Suffice it to say, however, that this is one of the few films I can watch over and over again, and that has left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
