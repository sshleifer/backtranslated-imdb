If you read only a synopsis of the plot, this movie would sound like a typical 1930's. The story seems quite artificial, the subject matter is corny. The strength and beauty of this film lies in the cast's direct and earthly performances. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow show a variety of sensations, with rich subtle nuances floating over his face. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel there is a depth of feeling so obvious among the main characters. Cruel emotions are so sincerely portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: when Clark Gable looks down with so much joy and surprise to his son, he raises it and proudly says, "My son!", I could not help but remember that Mr. Gable's own son was born he posthumously. This is one of the best examples of the movies of the Depression era.
