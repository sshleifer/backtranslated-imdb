Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant around the world (about 2 million children are trafficked each year) and does so sensibly and without manipulation - a difficult task that the Priority Films team does with great success . American actor Ron Livington starred in the film alongside rookie Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring to the screen what is common for people in the notorious K11 red light district in Cambodia. Despite addressing a heavy theme, the film retains moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters closely, preventing the two-hour movie from being too difficult to watch. I'm glad a movie like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a good first step. It's great and a movie everyone should see.
