You can debate Prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about his musical talent neither then nor now. He looks somber twenty years later, but the song remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Having lived the hype of this movie (high school in 85) I can say that there was nothing greater at the time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor "Little Nikki" and all the other things under the sun through the PMRC (Country Music Resource Center) for every "Air Band" at the time going by Prince was the hottest thing. For a few weeks, at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and got so excited when it debuted. It did not disappoint. EVERYONE was caught. I was an MTV addict back then (they played music then ... all the time). Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I should rate this comment by saying that, at that time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Bunch of Gulls and others in the genre Punk / New Wave "The Prince's music at that time transcended all types and styles. The reasons why some people seem so extravagant and regretful now is that it was so great.All things reminiscent of the 1980s were iconic.It was mainstream and seems like a clich√© now.It has become so popular that it has become ridiculous.It is like the rappin Granny for Wendy's Hamburgers. <br /> <br /> It sounds stupid now because EVERYONE was involved in it (unfortunately, like a bizarre purple macaroon or something.) Anyway, I hope this has given you a little insight.
