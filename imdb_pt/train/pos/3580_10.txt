I do not think a movie like this would be released today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists to keep you at the tip of your spot. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has: an interesting study of how families deal with grief. Like when the language to heal and overcome a tremendous loss leaves us dumb, and we rely on raw emotions. Mourning without reason and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a kid who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the movie gets more than his fair share. He finally leaves and moves with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), who makes it clear to him that it was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew this in his heart, but he needed to hear those words from his parents and receive his forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved in this movie: the lack of dialogue. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really watch the actors' reactions. Something that we can not do much with today's movies. <br /> <br />
