I lost almost the entire first season, but when the other shows went to reruns, I started watching. I ended up buying the entire first season off of iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedies. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor keeps me rolling all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a bit of Russell goes away. I like most of the other cast members (but I'm not saying he does not add to the show). Do yourself a favor. If you have not checked it, try it. If you can watch the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good the program is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long run.
