I'm far from being a fan of Sylvester Stallone and I think the only time I really enjoyed his appearance was in the French film Taxi 3, which is a small role almost non-existent. And yet, I must admit that this movie has not been that bad, even though I'm afraid of the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges into her death from a high top of a 4000-foot mountain, he can not force himself to continue working as a Forest ranger. For almost a year he does not put food in the reserve but returns. Shortly after he returns, they receive an emergency call from a group of hikers who were trapped in a snowstorm. At least, that's what the guards believe. In fact, it's a group of thieves who crashed with the plane in the mountains after the audacious plan to steal cash-filled cases from a flying government plane. The cases are scattered all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them ... This is not one of the smarter movies of all time but in its genre it's a Pleasant experience. 1. I especially liked John Lithgow as the master of evil and leader of the thieves gang. I know him best on the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun," but I also enjoyed his performance in that movie. Overall the acting was good, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one liners but it also offered a very nice decor. This film was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests ... Maybe that's why I give this movie a higher score than I usually give it to an action / adventure movie of that kind. I give it a 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect much, this is a nice movie.
