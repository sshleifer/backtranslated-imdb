This miracle of a movie is one of those movies that has a long-lasting effect on you. I have read one or two reviews of angry people who, in my opinion, are Republican or child beaters, and their extremist comments speak of the power of cinema to confront people with their own darkest secrets. No piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and this is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the film and its performance by Bret Carr is not to be missed. The very nature of its almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater or be released or question their own identity. Bravo on the next level of cinema.
