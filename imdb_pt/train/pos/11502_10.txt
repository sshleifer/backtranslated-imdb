As a forty-something urban explorer / photographer and long-time fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my childhood, one aspect that was not mentioned is the amount of urban exploration that Carl's character performed during the series. He always managed to get into a great abandon, sewer or tunnel after another. Armed only with his trustworthy penny (okay, so he had some torches in the tunnel of the episode of the primal monkey) and his camera, he never took any other equipment to protect or facilitate exploration. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently bought the DVD box from the two pilot movies and subsequent TV episodes, and slowly revisited all the shows. And although I remember seeing them in the early 70's when they aired for the first time, it's been over 30 years ... many of them look new again. Campy, dated and tacky - but charming and lots of fun. They just do not do things like that these days. Now all spin-offs regurgitated with predictable characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16 year old daughter has been sitting around watching the episodes with me and developed an appreciation for them (she likes the genre). This gives me hope and faith that the series will continue in the new generations of fans in the coming years.
