I do not think I could have liked it better, although certain things were disturbing. I will not say what, if you have not seen it ... you will have to find out for yourself. Anyway, what movie can you miss with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy eyes? All in all, the plot was sufficiently developed. Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were capable, and there were many hilarious scenes in it. The general idea is that the story is very tightly knit, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory ... for the sake of opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
