I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie with no swearing, no sex and no violence. You can think of it as "the best girl movie," but I bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who also love. Do not invite the kids, though. This movie is very discreet. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and stunning scenery, coupled with the gentle ways of the ladies, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> So that no one thinks that you really only watch one type of movie, I'll paraphrase a phrase I once heard on "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies are "The Deer Hunter "and" Enchanted April ".
