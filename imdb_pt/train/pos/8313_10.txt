First of all, I think the comment below is unworthy of a site like this. Obviously you have no taste and do not respect the taste of others. Do not give you a history lesson, but I think it needs to be done. The black actors out there are just, if not more, successful than the others. If you are not part of the "black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity, and vibrancy of old films such as "Sparkle," "Mahogany," and "Cooley High." As sadly you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics, so therefore you need to keep your mouth shut and just follow your run without dancing. Thank you.
