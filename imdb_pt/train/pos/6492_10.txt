I'm not a very good writer, so I'll continue like this. World at War is the best WWII documentary I've seen. I've seen different World War II documentaries (not just English / American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary I've seen. I think I could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it does a very good job of covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair to all. It does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It has a lot of original images, including colored pictures and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 70's, when many more were alive). It has great music and narrator. All-in-all I gave this a 10/10, because it's so good. (I did not see specials in the DVD version so I can not comment on that)
