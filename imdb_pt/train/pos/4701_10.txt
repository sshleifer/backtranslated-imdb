"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment about the movie. What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings the idiot Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to utter profane words, well, it would seem that it would be frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will fall into the annals of film history as one of the greatest idiots. <br /> <br /> There is, of course, a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an "R" because he could not utter profanity.
