I was shocked and surprised by the negative comments I saw on the web, I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very cute and funny sequel to everyone - kids and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find this very informative film, shows lessons about being true to yourself and following your heart. I thought I had a great animation, and the casting of the voice was very good; the songs played by Brooke Allison as well. As this film was divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite among the three is the story of when Jaq the mouse became human for a day thanks to the fairy godmother and her magic.
