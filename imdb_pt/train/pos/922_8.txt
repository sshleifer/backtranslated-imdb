At least half an hour a week. I have no interest in anything on the big networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, though Larry can be annoying at times. I really like the Middle-earth action figures they bring with Hunter. Most of the other characters are also interesting. The show next to Siegfried and Roy is also fun. The animation is top notch, and definitely the best CG that was made into a weekly TV show. Usually, when they get big names to star in a show, they try to hide a script or bad characters. Not totally true in this show, though, there are some characters who were weak and improved by dubbing, but overall the characters stand out. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for 16 or more. There is nothing here that most children have not heard before, and most of the jokes would probably fly over their heads. Definitely not as rude and brash as South Park, but it does bring some of the same "Bash everyone". One example is that he makes fun of Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in one episode. The father of pride and other productions of Dreamworks, like Shrek, also feel like spiritual successors to Animaniacs, Pinky and Brain, and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of mood that has grown. It may not be as spirited as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope it ends well this season and is renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, I will never find a reason to watch the big 3 again.
