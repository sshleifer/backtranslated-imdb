In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Epidermolysis Bullosa Distrophic (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered with agonizing wounds and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and his death, and the result was a film, broadcast for the first time in March, which was a uplifting, confusing and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Not turning away from the sad reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the fullest. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first screened in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off became the most talked about documentary of that year. It attracted nearly five million viewers and, after the screening, the public donated more than half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. A Memorial Fund Jonny Kennedy was created to raise another half a million in order to ensure that Jonny Kennedy left a million-pound legacy.
