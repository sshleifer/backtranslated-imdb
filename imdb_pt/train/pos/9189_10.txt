Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o'clock at night. one night, I could not sleep until 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> This short review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say that this is the best episode I have ever seen. I'm not saying everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, taking care of my father, in a coma in the ICU before he passed. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he's a salesman whose identity was mistaken for that of a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> When ten minutes passed, I knew that either Tony was dreaming or was watching some other program. It was not like the normal sopranos and I loved it. Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks up at the sky in a "helicopter spotlight" and we see the nudge, a doctor with a flashlight. We see this only for a moment and the sequence ends until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just said. <br /> <br /> Tony left the coma for just a moment. Her boys take A.J. House and Carmella, overcome by stress, break in the hallway: a defining moment in the episode. For the rest of the episode, we cut the real world: the family coping with the potential negative outcome of this coma, and Tony's alternate reality that accompanies what's going on in his mind and world around you. <br /> <br /> So comes the stellar point in the episode: after AJ ends up telling his mother that he was disapproved at school, she goes in to see Meadow sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> She approaches Tony, and utters the best phrase of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and lights a light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to dial, but he can not - like he's trying to say something back to Carmella, but he can not physically do it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out the window. A sparkling light that has been repeated throughout the episode now seems to call it across the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold I'd like to die for" Moby house perfectly with these latest images and helps to create an emotional roller coaster of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: Watch the next episode. You find out what the light is. It is wonderful.
