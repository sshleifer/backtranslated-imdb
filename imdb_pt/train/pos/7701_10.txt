This has always been one of my favorite movies and always will be. In recent years, I've become a 50/60 sci-fi fan trying to collect all the best that was made then. I love many things about them, how gaudy they could be to how technically correct some of them were. Great colors and sets also make me go. It's a shame when they redo some of those good old movies; they almost always consume it, just look at the recent re-do of the day the Earth stopped, it's crap! The Forbidden Planet is one of the all-time space-reference movies, and now they're trying to remake it as well, and I shudder to think how the new one will be! In my opinion, some things, like fantastic classic movies, should be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people a thrill in the process. Since they add all the junk we have available now, the movie seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I notice that the astronaut uniforms on the Forbidden Planet were also used for the "Queen of Outer Space"! That just says budgets were a little lower back then, were not they? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this film of Leslie Nielsen in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors) , Earl Holiman and, of course, Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> Special effects are fantastic, and the plot is no exaggeration. This is a great science fiction experience!
