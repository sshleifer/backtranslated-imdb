"The Lady in Question" (1999), starring Gene Wilder, is a well-played drama drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white series by Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and "Cash" left me guessing until the end. There were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but I had no idea which character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special charm about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections that make him perfect for the role. The parts of the film that portrayed acting actors went very well. I'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast. I'm not surprised to see that he did some of the recordings for the movie. Even his singing was delicious. I like him in this role more than his old "dumber" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope A & E continues this series. They should call it something like "The Mysteries A & E Gene Wilder". <br /> <br /> The music fits the period. I liked the live cool combination and the swing songs. I was a little unsure at first if we were seeing a flashback or if the action was taking place in that time period. And I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script. For me, this always distracts me. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I really enjoyed this second movie, at a well-done start, which we hope will be many others - as well as one of our other favorites: Raymond. Perry Mason of Burr.
