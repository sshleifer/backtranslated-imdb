If you played "Spider-Man" in the PS version, then you've seen it all. To really try it out, you should get the DC version. Simply put, it's a graphically superior game; the textures are crisp, the levels are easy to navigate and have a much better sound than the PS. I bought this game in the late 2000s and it continues to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game, but if you're a fan of the 'ol Web Head then you owe it to your game library. Rocking around the city as Spidey never looked so good and dead in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, get it for free. The DC version is simply amazing.
