Pinjar is one of the few movies that really makes a mark and makes you think a lot. Define on the India partition, this movie shows the true reality of partition India. Urmila receives maximum marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrait of a woman suffering without any way to go. His freedom, personal identity and family respect were taken at night during a tragic land dispute. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as his abhorrent remorse. There are several moments in the movie where someone is brought to tears. The movie in points is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are chilling, but Urmila's stamina and survival are remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to the woman who gave women freedom in similar situations. A remarkable film that must be credited by intelligent characters and storytelling.
