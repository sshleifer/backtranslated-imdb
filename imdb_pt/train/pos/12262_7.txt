About thirty years ago, Author Numa Sadoul published an interview with Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film approaches Sadoul today as he remembers the interview, while we listen to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and we see some old photos and images of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at Herge's request, and we now know that they dealt with his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of his associates (who would later become his second wife). . One interesting thing that the film does not address well is the shift in Tintin's books from the first right-wing and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in Soviet lands) to rather anti-imperialist books only a few years later (The Blue Lotus). Overall, I get out of this movie knowing a few more things about Herge and I see it as a bit more unpleasant than when I walk into the theater.
