If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters look very complicated for the series at this point. The situation is extraordinarily intriguing: the farmers of the province have two champions, one benevolent chief (for once) and one samurai philosopher who starts a sort of Grange; both are in conflict with the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because they increase their gaming revenues and their chances of picking up some land; his main or powerful ally is a seemingly Puritan who dies while drinking and playing, but secretly satisfies his own perverse appetites. (He also looks like Dracula, as villains in later Zatoichi films tend increasingly to do.) These characters have enough meaning for them to deserve to be pitted against Zatoichi as he was originally drawn, but now he has lost many of his nuances. , and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man Zatoichi killed, need more time than the film has to give, so that the story seems choppy, as if some scenes are missing. In addition, the film shows the virtues of most others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, creating a vivid, believable and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of what is obvious in the occasional episode where the director simply feels lack), and a technical quality that, by its very nature, disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets, so that its limitations do not seem to exist. And, of course, there is the lead actor, whose presence, as well as his performance, makes it all work. This must be one of the most well-sustained series in film history.
