I remember Casper's comics, but I do not remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know, but in my old age, here I am watching this animated short Casper yesterday. Then I was shocked to read the user comments here. Have people missed the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other ghosts, who like to go out every night and scare the c-p of everyone. "He sees no future in this," according to the narrator. Instead, one night he leaves for the rural part of town, inadvertently scares some animals and can not find any friends. This brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him shouting and befriends him. The two become friends, but soon the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress. <br /> <br /> Other reviews have mentioned what happens, so I'll talk about it too. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is in tears for losing "the only friend I've ever had". But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie" the fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, leaps into his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments "they lived happily ever after." Both characters look very happy. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about it? This is a good story with a happy and happy ending.
