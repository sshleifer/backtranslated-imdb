IT'S OK. There are people who should not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not see if you do not like black humor or satire. 2) Do not like if you take offense at The Watchmen. 3) Do not see if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, run, do not walk, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's peculiar, it's a tremendous pleasure from every evil superhero clich√© known to man. Occasional raids on junior humor do not spoil the understated fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as some funniest little pieces from Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's good to see Louise Lasser getting a job too.) I laughed all the time. Absolutely nothing serious, a bit strange, but good.
