I saw this movie again and realized how close it is to the novel if we ignore Cary's part about [Leslie Howard's] childhood. Considering that at the time not much can be shown on screen, [not that there is much in the novel] the character's obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well conveyed to the public. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen in love with someone else and the other side has tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that Maugham was invited to do a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started in the studio, he started crying and could not finish more than a few lines and the whole project was released. One can say that the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of a part of it, at least.
