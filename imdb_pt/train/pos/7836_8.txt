Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) insists on having the head of the murderer of his beloved husband, Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), but his brother King Gunther (Theodor Loos), refuses her request. When King Attila of the Huns pardons Kriemhild through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, she makes him promise by oath on behalf of his king that no man would ever offend her. Hagen Tronje hides the Nibelungen treasure at the bottom of a lake. Corner 2: How Kriemhild leaves his homeland and how it was received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings some land from where Siegfried died, and travels to the court of the Huns, where he is received by the own Attila, who also promises, by oath, to defend her. Canto 3: As King Attila besieged Rome and how Kriemhild summoned his brothers: When Kriemhild delivers a boy, Attila returns to his kingdom and asks Kriemhild what she would like to please her most. She asks him to invite his brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Corner 4: How Kriemhild welcomes his brothers: Kriemhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronje, but his brothers maintain loyalty to their friends and again do not accept his request. Corner 5: As the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but he refuses, because according to the laws of the desert, a guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers Gold to the Hums to the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight, and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> Corner 6: The affliction of the Nibelungen: The Huns lose the battle against the Nibelungen, but keep them besieged within the castle of Attila. Kriemhild promises to save their lives as long as they deliver Hagen Tronje, but his brother Gunther says the Germans are loyal to their friends. <br /> <br /> Corner 7: The End of the Nibelungen: After the death of Rüdiger von Bechlarn, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally captured. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje, ending his revenge with the destruction of the Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of Siegfried's poetic saga through "Kriemhild's Revenge" is also told through seven dramatic songs. The nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; The second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge and loyalty. The solid script with perfect character development, the excellent cast performances and the incredible direction of Fritz Lang produced another epic ahead of time. Margarete Schön is impressive with a totally different woman, obsessed and inflexible in her desire for revenge. The costumes that Kriemhild uses are also very impressive, and his performance is based on his face and appearance. I was a bit disappointed with Attila's reaction after the death of his only son, since I found him very passive. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Nibelungen?
