When I first saw this show, I thought it sounded interesting. I watched, watched as it revolved around Sarah, as the character sees the world ... spinning around her. I understood, but I was not laughing much. <br /> <br /> On stage and in her show, she is racist, coarse, insensitive, and extremely egocentric. I did not get it at first, and I took it all seriously. So I could see her movie, Jesus is magic. I think it served as a primer for Sarah Silverman for me, explaining to me just what 'language' she is talking about. She's like Marilyn Manson, working so hard to give us a world full of horrible ideas and images, but you eventually realize it's not an attack, it's a statement. And once you understand this, you discover that you are happy that someone has finally given it to you. <br /> <br /> I do not want to suggest that only smart people will understand, or that to hate this program is to prove their idiocy. While I enjoy many 'smart' shows, I still do not see the mood of Curb Your Enthusiasm today. I get the impression that it's good, but I just do not understand. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program, but I'm glad they showed up around. <br /> <br /> The creators of this program work hard, each episode is loaded not only with dialogue and plot, but with songs, or sequences of dreams, production numbers. These people are not setting up something to fill a schedule and please advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can ride. If I were to predict the future of this show, I'd say it will follow the path of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled ahead of time and will live in the hearts of fans and on DVD. But be brave, creators of the SSP, your target audience is out there, and we'll be watching as long as they let you do the show.
