While this movie will not fall into the annals of the big screen, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film is finally being released on video where it should have premiered in the first place. <br /> <br /> The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners they named, "The Hungry Bachelors Club". . Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a substitute in order to get a payout for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a man mysterious and in love with Cadillac who becomes his lover. Fox gives a discreet and touching performance and Nunn is as talented as ever. Micheal des Barres is a joke as a top lawyer. The castles - made up of familiar faces - work well together to bring this strange group of characters to life. This is a good rental and one of the few that you can watch with the whole family.
