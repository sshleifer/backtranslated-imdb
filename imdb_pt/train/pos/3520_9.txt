This is a "Series B" Film Noir, and my vote reflects its participation in this genre. I saw this movie last night at a cinema on the left bank in Paris, where it opened a two week noir film. The movie has some flaws, yes, but many delicious elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer commented, the drumming scene is incredible! (B-movies could walk where A-movies were banned from entering!) And the plot is intriguing. As for the Franchot Tone, however, I beg to disagree: for me, it is adequately mysterious; just the right tone of scary. One has to keep in mind that there is a kind of German Expressionism happening here (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and so an air of exaggeration fits into the entire film. However, it is for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the beautiful Ella Raines who, in only her third credited performance, kept this spectator enthralled throughout the film. A "Girl Friday" type with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it's a wonder she has not become a household name. But she's so good here that I just asked for another film of her ('Impact') from the Internet, and I can not wait to see it too.
