Time for a hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir- Vipul Amrutlal Shah Casta-Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** Eureka! We got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen in Vipul Shah's 'Waqt', we are likely to find this year's first genuine success. Filled with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood program, 'Waqt' has everything it takes for a movie to be clicked with the Indian public. It's the kind of movie that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplate your next visit to phoren! In this 'saga of Indian emotions', then, we have a happy family (is not it always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman who became a millionaire (do not ask how! ... is there anything about selling toys while delivering letters and all this? Seriously - who cares?), Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a father Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son's negligent attitude toward life's responsibilities. His love for Aditya, however, results in his procrastination of the grave question. However, when confronted with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house - hoping that the new situation may make him more conscious of his own life. But this presumptuous solution becomes a problem in and of itself, as the division between the loving father-son increases and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama. So, before the break, you have the first funny and then annoying comedy of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and post-break, there are your handkerchief moments between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati piece 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' on which the film is based) does a good job at keeping the narrative flowing. The dialogues tend to be inconsistent at times. It does not help that the songs appear as acne on a teenage face and undermine the process. Clearly, some numbers could have been eliminated. On the front, Vipul shows that he has a natural talent for storytelling. 'Waqt', as well as his first debut work, 'Aankhen', manage to keep him interested until the last round. On a personal note, the seesaw of emotions was a bit abrupt to me. But measuring from the public's reactions, it was working up to the fist. <br /> <br /> Finally, 'Waqt' is all about their performances, which amounts to a whole point in the overall standings! Amitabh Bachchan is as reliable as ever. Your energy is visible and so is your age! Shefali shows performance with fine nuances and combines with the superstar at every stage. Boman and Rajpal bring down the house with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do but fulfill the superficial role of a heroine. When it all comes down, 'Waqt' is Akshay's vehicle. I have always stated that Akki is as good as the paper suits him. Put him in a 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and he's fantastic, but in a 'Bewafaa' he's terribly bad. Here, Akki is probably at his best. Be it your comic timing or your emotional representations, it's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for your fans! Ironically, his best previous effort was in 'Aankhen' - with the same director and Big B by his side! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is by no means a memorable movie. It is not one of those that will be presented in the best films of our industry. But it's one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal success, 'Waqt' can simply do the trick! <br /> <br /> Abhishek Bandekar <br /> Trivia - This is the second of Akshay Kumar. consecutive film after 'Bewafaa', in which he performs onstage during the climax! <br /> <br /> * Bad *** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent * April 22, 2005
