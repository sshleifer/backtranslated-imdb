Well, if you have an open mind enough to like Barber Shop then you will like this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give the current score you have: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone prepared to watch movies out of their own racial motives. It's engaging, it's true for life, on two or three occasions you miss the connections between scenes, but often, especially at the end, you see yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors life can be. <br /> <br /> I like and recommend it to anyone open beyond the traditional American movie.
