Slow but beautifully assembled history of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling seems much less heavy than in his previous historical epics and his work tableaux is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is an absolute hog, Neil Hamilton is poor but dashing and Carol Dempster is ... well, Carol Dempster is most of what is wrong with Griffith in this period but she does not show up enough to slow down and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the curiosities for this movie say that it originally came in just over 2 hours when first released, but that there is no cut that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release was introduced at a slower rate of fps which increases the voltage and brings it back to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in terms of storytelling than sound versions, such as THE PATRIOT. Although not exactly the best in the Griffith league, such as WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, a great way to spend a few hours.
