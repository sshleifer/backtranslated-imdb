My favorite movie genre is the western, it really is the only genre of film that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them like the Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top of my list of ten favorites, the western is the Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only the black and white film of the partnership. director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of profits rather than a direct salary from Universal. Many of these agreements followed for the players, making them as rich as the tycoons who employed them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann had until then basically made B-shots, noir-type things without real budgets. Shortly before Winchester, 73 Mann made a beautiful western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, who never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen and decided that Mann was the one with whom he decided to ally himself. In this film, Mann also developed a mini stock company, just as John Ford was legendary. In addition to other Stewart cast as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future Mann films. <br /> <br /> It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why do not I say it, but until that moment we had never seen so much fury from James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann reached the soul of Jimmy Stewart and dragged some demons that we all dread. <br /> <br /> Hatred is aptly demonstrated at a great time toward the beginning of the film. After Stewart and Helper Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp, played by Will Geer, because the guns are not loaded into Earp's Dodge City. There is a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the favorite betting is the Dutch Henry Brown, played with threat by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer enter the hall and Stewart and McNally meet instantly and try to get weapons that are not there. Look at the close-ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. Another character that Stewart faces in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea's best moment on the screen. He is an outlaw psychopathic killer who is mortal as a southpaw, even though he has two cannons. <br /> <br /> Another person Stewart knows is Shelley Winters, who is engaged and engaged in a confrontation for Duryea and dead. Her best scenes are with Duryea, who is a fantasy for her. She plays for time until she can escape safely from him. Guess who she'll end up with? <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there is not a sour note in the cast. John McIntire, as a naughty Indian merchant, Jay C. Flippen, as the gray-haired army sergeant and Rock Hudson, had his first real news as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, better known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenic and Old Lace, has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times. Mann and Stewart made eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth-western Night Passage when they fought and Mann left the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.
