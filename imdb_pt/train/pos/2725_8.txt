"In Cold Blood," adapted by director Richard Brooks of Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and foolish murder of a family of four by a pair of unfortunate criminals. The film stands out as a character study of the assassins, particularly the trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The cast includes few recognizable names, but they bring history to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with different personalities. They throw away each other effortlessly, while Blake also has many opportunities to explore the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the cast is merely medium and not worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for his script and direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script is not calculated with a reckless narration in the last stages. Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is editing. Also noteworthy is the jazz score of Quincy Jones, who secured the last of the four Academy Award nominations. <br /> <br /> Unlike so many other crime films, this does not glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiful characters instead of categorically condemning them. Whether you agree with it or not, the film presents an interesting alternative to Hollywood's usual approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are treated.
