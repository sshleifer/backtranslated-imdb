Some movies simply should not be redone. This is one of them. In itself is not a bad movie. But it fails to capture the flavor and terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who simply did not bring the right feeling to Luke's character. But the main flaw of this version is that it has shied away from much of Shirley Jackson's story in her attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the emotion of the previous film in a more stylish special effects exchange. Once again I will say that in itself is not a bad movie. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the old version much more.
