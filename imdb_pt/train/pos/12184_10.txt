In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil) Orson Welles gave him the role of a lush man. In "The Lady of Shanghai" is the only time I see him holding the role of the victim. The role of the culprit, he gave to Rita Hayworth, I think it's because he was in love with her. So it's an interesting movie. But I also think the story is excellent. The direction is cool, as usual with Welles: two scenes are particularly bright: the aquarium and the end of the mirrors. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)
