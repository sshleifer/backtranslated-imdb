I'll start by reporting my first encounter with Prince's music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing naked for "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked the people who is this singer? I was told it was the prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful topless dancer. Later, I began to listen to other songs by Prince and "dig" them for real. When Purple Rain left I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesotan. The film surprised me. I immediately became Prince's # 1 fan of the "War Baby" generation. Later, I discovered that one of my cousins ​​was her secretary, and she got me, and my nephew in a v. Prince concert where we sit next to your mother ... how cool is that! Coming back to the subject at hand, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought Prince's acting was fine, Apollonia struggled a little, but everything in all was well. John Gielgud was not available to play 'The Kid', so Prince took the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly rhythmic (never slow) and terribly directed. I rank among the best music films of all time. The last time I attended was after an interval of 7 years and still delivered. I am so proud of the companion Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and would love to tell him personally. He walked right in front of me during the above-mentioned show and said, "Hi," to my nephew, but not me. He was talking to his mother. I was a little devastated, but he's still number 1 with me.
