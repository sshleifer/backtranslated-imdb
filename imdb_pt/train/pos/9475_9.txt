The most satisfying element about "Dan in real life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is very realistic. The cast of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, appropriately aged for the role! If this movie had been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. Another wonderful thing about "Dan in Real Life" is that it's a perfect movie for adults interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: idiot girls, chauvinistic faces and despicable jokes. "Dan in real life" is witty and has funny and clever laughs everywhere. While other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience with laughter, "Dan in Real Life" jokes are more natural and intelligent, and involve some thinking on the part of the public. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in real life" is that the middle rebel daughter is played very scandalously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's hard to say whether this was a personal choice on her part or a choice of director. Either way, your character is unreal and irritating. But, this is only a small flaw in the film, and it does not take away from the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dan in real life" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and moronic comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful and light comedy.
