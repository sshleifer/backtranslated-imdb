I had heard that this movie was good from many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew surpassed those high expectations! It had funny parts, kept me entertained by the action and all the guys trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was also very good. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys were trying to kill us?!" Corky: "Yeah, I was thinking that too. Actually, it kind of scares me!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate it when people try to kill me. It's so rude!" <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
