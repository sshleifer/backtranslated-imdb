Let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937, studio bosses believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role. The actors were under contract and did not always have a choice about what role they played. History end. <br /> <br /> This is a truly great epic story of love, individual rights, strata of class and issues of men / women. The centerpiece of the film are two brilliant interpretations of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer who is about to have a wife (Rainer). From the beginning, he treated her with respect, during a time when women were seen as little more than hired help. Without giving much of the film, they go through the ups and downs of all relationships, and even though the story may take place in the late 19th / early 20th century, the story and many of their feelings, it seems believable. In addition to the fact that the film is about 5-10 minutes longer than necessary, and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical characters of the 1930s, this is a truly wonderful film that unfortunately, became the victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
