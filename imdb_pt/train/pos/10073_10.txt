One of the great things about many of the great Chinese movies you can find, if you're lucky, in video stores, is that they are very accurate accounts of real and true stories. Goodbye, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Murderer, and this movie are perfect examples. Filmmakers have a real story and work hard to create a movie accurately without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience - the hallmark of many Hollywood movies and especially Disney. <br /> <br /> In this story we follow the last years of a famous local street artist nicknamed the King of Masks for his mastery of the Sichuan Art of Change. Throughout losing his only son many years before, he seeks to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids women to have that kind of work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well when he gladly prepares to pass his art. But the son ends up being discovered as a girl. From then on, the story gets very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - a regional operatic style related to the Beijing Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine must look closely at Master Liang's portrait of a man playing the female role in the Chinese Opera. This may help them understand that the actors in these female roles were probably not homosexual or castrati, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they are totally unaware of their own sexuality.
