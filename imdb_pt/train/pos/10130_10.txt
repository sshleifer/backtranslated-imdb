The pilot is extremely well done. It shows how the characters connect in future episodes. I do not think anyone could have created a better driver for this show. It displays remarkable creativity on the part of writers. Although not everything has been straightened out because it was the first episode, many events that happen in future seasons have been demonstrated in the pilot. An example would be the future relationship of Ross and Rachels. Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was outweighed by an incredible plot and excellent casting choice. Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to an unbeatable comedy!
