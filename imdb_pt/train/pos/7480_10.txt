This movie is one of Tom Cruise's best films. It captures the public's imagination with his role as David Aames. Your character can relate to all of us in some way. The plot is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the movie. I've never watched Cruise movies much before, but after seeing it, he showed me his true talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end where everything comes to a grand conclusion and he discovers the truth. If you have not seen it, you should definitely try it. It's one of those movies that once you've started watching it, you've only managed to see it through to the end, or it will keep you thinking and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you should just go buy it and take a risk that is what I did and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's A * 10/10 I promise once you watch it, it will stay with you and you will like it forever.
