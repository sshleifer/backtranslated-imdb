Fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), accused of killing her little girl. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspect. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mentality that led to the conviction of the woman, based on almost no concrete evidence. I love films that question the media, and also movies that take a good look at how people are attacked by the justice system. I have always felt that juries should be shown 12 Angry Men before they do their duty. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical examination of how we humans interpret events based both on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A scream in the dark is equally clinical. Schepisi takes care not to make the film anything melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I find it interesting.
