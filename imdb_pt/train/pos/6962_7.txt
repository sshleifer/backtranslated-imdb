My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a nice surprise for me, I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? That was it! But this movie had so many wonderful laughs and a fun storyline that anyone could have fun. I know this was a very cheesy movie but Uma and Anna were so cool and Steve was a great addition along with a great cast that seemed to have a lot of fun and that's what made the movie really work. Jenny Johnson (scary, this is my best friend's real name) is not your typical typical librarian, when Matt, his common man, invites her out, he has more than he expected, he asked the G-Girl on a date, the superhero of the world! But when he finds out that a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides it might be a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenny will not have her since he fell in love with another girl, Hannah, and she will make her life a hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not have picked a better girl to finish. <br /> <br /> The effect was corny, but you seriously go through them quickly, the story and cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was like a Prime step. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should not take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that I think if I could laugh at it, anyone could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
