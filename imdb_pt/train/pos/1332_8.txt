In 1594, in Brazil, the Tupinamba Indians are friends of the French and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portuguese. A Frenchman (Arduino Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás and, despite his judgment to convince them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes a slave and lives maritally with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle. To commemorate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "How Nice My French" is another great low-budget film by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is filmed using natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and actresses present themselves naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving a dazzling performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploration of my country by the Europeans, concentrating on the Portuguese and French of the time, negotiating with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors for our natural resources. This film was awarded at national festivals, such as the Brazilian Brazilian Film Festival of 1971, with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Set Designer. (Régis Monteiro); Association of Art Critics of São Paulo, with the best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other prizes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "How nice was my French"
