"Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise, is in my opinion the first series since "TOS" to regain the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "Going Where No Man Has Been Before." Scott Bakula is perfectly chosen as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the whole cast really show a real reverence for the legacy of Star Trek. John Billingsley is brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is totally delightful as the tempting, yet logical, scientific employee of Vulcan T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best episode of all the Treks, and I believe Gene Roddenberry would certainly be proud.
