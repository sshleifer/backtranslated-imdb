Miike makes an adventure movie for children, unlike the endless story. In fact, it's one of my least favorites of the director's films. Even the worst Miike is better than a good number of movies, however, and The Great Yokai War has much that is worth recommending. It's at least as loud and unpleasant as most American children's films. I would think that the children themselves would find it a lot to like (the DVD includes an English Dub), but, like all Miike films, it may tend to move very slowly. That means you have a kind of odd inequality where there is sometimes a high action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as the characters talk. The story itself is not very good, and Miike's perpetual flaw of incoherence raises her ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. This has to be Miike's most expensive film, and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and they come in all different, fantastic ways, and the costume designers, the special effects team and everyone else involved in the projects did a great job. I saw the 1968 movie in which this is supposedly based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the rubber monsters you can find there have been transformed into more convincing entities using cutting-edge makeup and special effects. I especially liked the appearance of one of the villains (or girls, in this case), Agi, who has a dark shadow, a fair white outfit, a white hive hairstyle, and a whip. It is touched by chance by Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you may remember as Lucy Liu's teenager in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the film is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who provided voices for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
