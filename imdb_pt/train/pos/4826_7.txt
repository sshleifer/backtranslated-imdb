This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her early years as King of Britain. <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has an incredible production. Each scene is designed and decorated with immaculate details. Extravagant costumes, luxurious locations and beautiful landscaped gardens make "The Young Victoria" a very impressive place. I was most amazed at the thoughtful cinematography. As each person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that struck me most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame of Victoria's angle, while the angle of Melbourne Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne was holding her arm at her hips. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, it is very compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed or even explained. I was expecting a great coronation scene, and unfortunately only lasted a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it were longer. , so that the events could be explained correctly, without haste.
