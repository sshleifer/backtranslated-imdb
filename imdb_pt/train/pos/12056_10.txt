Although I have loved haunted home movies like Amityville and Poltergeist, this has made the TV adaptation of Susan Hills' book a major impact on the horrors of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (many of whom star in Heartbeat and other TV dramas), excellent acting and fantastic scenery (which depicts the 1920s life convincingly), it has all the right ingredients to attract the viewer for what is a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence or blood to send shivers down the spine of an audience. Using her own imagination, the Woman in Black is a figure of fear and dread, and whose presence is never absent when she first appears. <br /> <br /> The main character Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, learns about his invisible spectrum. in its mission to liquidate the property. The widow dies and Arthur spends some nights in his dark house, in which he realizes many oddities, which may haunt him for a few days. Some of the scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, particularly the locked room that opens, which shuts off the generator and closes Arthur in the darkness. The film becomes more distressing the more you put yourself in Arthurs shoes, and your efforts to shake this ghost. The writer puts many chilling additions into history, an example being the reappearance of the tin soldier. One is eager to learn the meaning of all this. The fact that we have never learned much about the widow, leaves more to the imagination and makes everything even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The widow, most of the time, seems cruel and intimidating. The scene after rolling the generator sent the chills down from me, a woman who appears out of nowhere in the marshy land isolated with a howling wind? having been in such properties, I can understand how insulting this is. And the scene at the inn may have been the most horrible thing I've ever seen, one I do not want to watch hastily or show to the elderly relatives. I always woke up at night thinking she was behind me while I slept. <br /> <br /> Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost jewel. I agree to some extent that the Internet advertising campaign for this movie was totally exaggerated and I can see why people were disappointed after spending the best 50 pounds, but I think the network defeated hidden rocks because it makes overexposed films. I think it's still brilliant and fantastically represented and I consider the greatest ghost story of the last century.
