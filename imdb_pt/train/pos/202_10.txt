Give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of his time - Walter Matthau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this film + director Herbert Ross, all of which makes this stage adaptation come true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the '70s. I love the kind of humor in this movie, it just makes me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> I got this VHS movie 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper - only $ 3). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to watch it again because I missed some parts the first time. The second time I watched it, I felt much better, and I laughed a lot more. I'm definitely going to do this on DVD because I have to see the special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how it happens. Two people work together as animators / performers. They do well on stage, but really argue offstage, they can not survive another minute with each other, so some 15 years later, you want to get them together for a TV special. You can find this in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It's a shame they died. George Burns earned this Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive a gym award at an advanced age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was terrific at it, too. He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor. He deserved that Golden Globe. While many people may disagree with what I am about to say, everyone in this movie has given a strong performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I recommend. One more thing: whoever hates this movie is a "Putz"
