This movie contains more action before the opening credits than in whole Hollywood movies of that type. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li. This team brought you many Hong Kong-rated movie productions, including the Once Upon A Time series in China. The action was swift and furious with incredible wire work. I only saw the wires in two shots. Beyond action, the story itself was strong and not just used as a filler. To find any other action movie to rival this, you should look for a Hong Kong movie store in your area. They are really worth checking out and usually never disappoints.
