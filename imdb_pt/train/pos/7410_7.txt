It happened in "Shower" in the foreign movies section of my local video store and passed several times since, from the cover, it looked like a farce or comedy. I was then lucky to buy a cheap copy and I'm happy for my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, one parent and two (2) adult children, each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern China. As with many "foreign" movies, the Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fascinating features of the local Chinese color, setting the stage for this story, it is the difficult yet moving relationships between men and a single woman involved in history, all having in the background the bathhouse of a village. <br /> <br /> Family history goes from strangeness to understanding and makes me happy to know These people. Added to the main storyline are the numerous small characters, the customers of the bathhouses and their conflicts and individual friendships. "Shower" is a film that moves away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity.
