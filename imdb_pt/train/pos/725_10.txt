Fascist director Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is photographed by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she were three meters tall) has a plan to make it completely square. Following are complications that defy that goal in the wonderful rock'n'roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles who lights the screen - she also has a hot body) who is an obsessive fan of punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big goggles and nerdy paper can not hide their stunning beauty) joins forces with Riff to end the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll forever, which is the mission desired by Togar. /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything but sex. Kate is crazy about Tom ... if he could pull his head out of the sand and see. Clint Howard steals the movie almost (honestly, who can steal this movie away from Soles?) As Eaglebauer, "the supplier" who can get almost anything. Your office is located in the boy's bathroom! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff when he sings a concert of THE RAMONES. <br /> <br /> A noisy joke that defies all the rules of normalcy ... and I loved it. It's like someone saying, "Let's make life fun for an hour and a half." The film is really anarchy ... a chaos without plot worshiping the RAMONES with all their heart (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to gain new audiences with this film). <br /> <br /> Ending quite sums up the film as a whole ... Riff and his classmates take up high school and a great party begins. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! Unconventional in any way, this movie just releases a frenzy. Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack with some of the best songs from THE RAMONES, this movie allows a viewer to accept a moment in life when the war did not dominate the headlines and people just had fun. Those, I think those were the days.
