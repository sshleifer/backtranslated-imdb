The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is with just one word: authenticity. I will not repeat what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much historical research and the careful attention to detail that the crew no doubt passed was appreciated by this viewer. As a student of history familiar with the period and definition of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about "Bleeding Kansas". Yes, there were freedoms taken about the actual events, as all fiction is capable of doing. But the overall feel of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (nor PC retrospective here) even the actors seem authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small part in the film) looked like she stepped in the form of a mid-19th century photograph. Few viewers I spoke with expressed unbelief in the stylized dialogue. They can not believe that 19th century farmers would "speak like poets." <br /> <br /> What they do not realize is that in this age of verbal wrangling, the American public public of the 19th century was surprisingly literate and eloquent. These people were created in Shakespeare and King James Version of the Bible. The writers reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging by the documentation of the time. The stylized dialogue just adds to the magical atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But beyond a historical document, this film also works at a visceral level. Beautifully photographed and executed, it dates back to the days of the great Western epics. The attack on Lawrence, Kansas, made so many times before in so many smaller films, is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This film has everything a discerning spectator could want. <br /> <br /> In a year that was overwhelmed by garbage like American Beauty, this great work was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I am sure that the ride with the devil will be given in the next few years. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
