A brave and courageous portrait of a part of World War II history, which most of us in the US had no idea of ​​has ever occurred. I would love to have this on video. It was only shown on t.v. once, as far as I know, back to 89 or 90. I ordered this movie, and most of the rental companies do not even know it. Great actresses everywhere, I wish I could see again. High level series.
