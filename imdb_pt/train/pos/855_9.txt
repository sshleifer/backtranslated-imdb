This movie is fantastic. Finally, well written characters that you can love for everything good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is completely hysterical in this modest role. I think it's the best thing he's ever done. He did other roles that exhibited shades of being able to this kind of work in full right, but this role finally gave him the space to run with it. I almost died as he crossed the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a couple to aspire too, as well as aspiring actors as well. Kinnear is so goofy that his back at the end is truly rewarding. You give good actors good works to play with and they give us something else back.
