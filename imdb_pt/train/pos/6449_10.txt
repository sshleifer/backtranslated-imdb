I was taken to this film by a friend and was skeptical about a Swedish film with subtitles. However, I enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed with confidence, without overwhelming images - though animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a few seconds in the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy has been illustrated from a satisfactorily fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with flaws and very natural characteristics. I particularly liked how the film managed to deal with multiple aspects of hypocritical human behavior that pertain to prejudice, discrimination and hypocritical pretense. An absolute gem of a movie that I will promote to anyone who wants to listen.
