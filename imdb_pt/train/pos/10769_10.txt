I love Monte Carlo and I really enjoyed this movie. I thought they were all very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very kind, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the girl rejected and confused with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total idiot. Cybill Shepard made a very sweet performance as a good vulnerable and ignored housewife. Set cast delicious. Very talented, intelligent script, lots of things and beautiful places. Just a good pick me up for a sad day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon.
