Spoilers - as far as I describe characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The subject is both gloomy and exciting. The stubborn determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With all the excuses due to him, his abandoned dog, continually put into expression, serves the character well. He is, as we in England would say about the character of the TV series of Inspector Taggart, bound to be bleak because he sees three murders a week. Well, this is not strictly accurate as Chikatila operated over several years ... <br /> <br /> You have a real notion of the USSR's resistance to bureaucracy, brilliantly portrayed by Joss Ackland (which often seems made for this type of paper). <br /> <br /> A key character (and I write this as the Invasion remake of the Body Thieves is being shown on BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov." His silent support of Burakov is firm. And that lasts through Perestroika and boosts the FBI's involvement in profiling. Bright. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see as far as I'm concerned.
