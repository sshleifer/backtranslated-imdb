Not only does this film have one of the big movie titles, but also the third team of 70's kids actors, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. It seems like I remember this movie being broadcast Halloween week in 1978 against Linda Blair in Stranger at our house. I lost in the first race choosing to see the other movie. Later, repeating, I saw that I made the right choice. The movie is not too bad, but it really has no creeps or surprises. Although I enjoyed the scene in which Richard Crenna shoots the family dog ​​without success.
