I've always been a big fan of this movie, first of all you've seen the cast, the acting is superb and it helps to make that movie move very well. Cybill Shepherd received great reviews for her role and they were well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past, when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage, comes to a halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot in life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex goes to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to follow with his. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter, Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a lot of unwanted memories (that's where the fun begins and embarrassing situations occur). They are heart and very cute. You will not be disappointed if you give it a chance, Chances Are you like it. Very funny and sweet!
