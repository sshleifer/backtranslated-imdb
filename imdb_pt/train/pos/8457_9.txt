Gundam Wing for me happens to be a good anime. A bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but above all nice. Now, before anyone jumps on my case and calls me "extreme," I admit that I have observed all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, The 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit there have been some problems with storytelling and some characters may seem like "stealing" (ie Zechs Marquise for the original Gundam Char), but this is an alternate universe show based on original series, as is SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, make sure to watch the original Gundam first, and then know that you are watching a UA series.
