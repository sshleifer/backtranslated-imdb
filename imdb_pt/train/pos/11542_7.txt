The first time I saw this, I did not laugh much. At the time, I was only fifteen, and I thought maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I first saw her a few months ago, and this time it was because Felix's unsuccessful suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the film. This scene made some of the things that Oscar said and did with Felix later in the film seem unnecessarily cruel, and their personality clashes were not as much fun as they might have been. If I still did not know the story, I would have been concerned that some of the Oscar-winning antics for Felix could get him to the limit. As it was, it did not make me laugh or smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, after all, a very good movie and spawned one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.
