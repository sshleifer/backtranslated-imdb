Very good western.This was the first time the writer Richard Wilson directed a film, also this was the first time for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a young and beautiful Angie Dickinson as a lounge girl. Robert Mitchum arrives in this outlaw-dominated city and is hired as a city traitor, but people are worried he will go too far, also about the damage he will cause to the city's business. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" which was made in 1959. This film maintains a very fast and exciting rhythm, it really keeps you on the edge.
