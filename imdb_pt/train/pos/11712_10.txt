This is a great movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to appear in the public eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not record it, I tried to look for it, but to no avail. Does anyone know how to achieve this?
