I was worried my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the character "Dark-Heart" is a bit rude and I do not like the way he changes shape into a "middle" frog, fox, kid? I was wrong, this movie was made for my son, not for me. It "catches" when it has passed over (below?) Of my head. Of course I did not get it. This is not one of the NEW children's films that adults will enjoy as well. This is straightforward for young people, and the staff knew what they were doing. There is no political ether. There is no magic key that saves the world from ourselves, no one has the right to access the excess, and everyone is not happy all the time. And as a side benefit, no one DIES! russ russill.
