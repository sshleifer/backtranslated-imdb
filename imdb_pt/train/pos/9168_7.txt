this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem I had with this was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was very old and made Jane look very shy. in the book, Jane seemed a much stronger character. I was very annoyed with this picture of her. the part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she rushes to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice in pitching it. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that made this version not be 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the 80's for TV. if it had been a feature film and better quality, it would have been perfect. My main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely very old.
