This movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters. I put it on my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone reviews) and I was intrigued for two whole hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that ferries between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable, even with almost no physical contact. Towards the end, I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and heroine to take his bedroom or simply consummate his passion. RML could have done without a curious subframe and the traditional 100 minutes would have been enough. I'm nitpicking though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library, this movie restored my faith in creating great movies.
