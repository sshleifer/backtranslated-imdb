This is a generally good movie, with good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weaker points of the film is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Because? Does it hurt to try some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Someone? <br /> <br /> The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman-Rani). Priya can not conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry her child. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to adopt? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I think if the writers had heard of all this, the movie would not have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional. <br /> Salman acts very well. It's cool to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how he finds it difficult to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's tacky and unrealistic. Rani is almost right; she is usually effective and tries to do something with the role, but is completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show grandly with its impeccable performance. She makes the transformation from a noisy prostitute to a sensitive woman with ease and ease. She lives the film, emits and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her positive and magnetic personality. This is one of the best performances of his career. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her contemporaries in the industry. She should only do more of these roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie just highlights what I said above. It's raucous, exciting and very well-acted. Pay attention to Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
