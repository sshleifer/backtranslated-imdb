After graduation from high school, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to take a trip to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a charming Australian named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. They agree. At the airport, however, they are arrested for smuggling drugs and then sentenced to 33 years in a Thai jail for something they say they did not do. Not really knowing what to do, they end up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. They say that if you have money, he can help you. Things start well, but they still can not get out. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good because it does not show what is going to happen and it is interesting all the time. I could not believe the ending though. It was one of those finals where you do not know 100% true, but you still know what really happened to Nick and the smuggling of drugs because of 'possession' etc. <br /> <br /> Claire The Danes and Kate Beckinsale give good performances here. Beckinsales's performance was a bit weak. Both the Danes and the Beckinsales characters are good, but they seem stronger. Paul Walker even has a small uncredited role here. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I gave it a 7/10.
