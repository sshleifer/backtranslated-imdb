I'm 14, so you'd probably think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. Boy, are you wrong? I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar for it. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and I loved it. This one was really cool, too. George Burns did a great job. The same thing happened with Walter Matthau (this is the first time I've seen him play). And even having very small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That particular one they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done. Let me tell you this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
