IT'S OK. I'm partial. I live near Shrewsbury, England, where this wonderful film was filmed. It still looks the same now. I remember them filming here very vividly, and the fake snow on the streets for days on end. Often, when I'm walking through Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house and it reminds me of the movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other versions of the screen. . Your physical appearance is not the typical miser. Scott is big and awesome. A man who thinks that the younger than himself is inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know history and quotes. The book is one of the most appreciated works of the English language. And I do not believe there are many cynics who would say that people are not capable of change and redemption. This film version portrays all this beautifully. George C. Scott may be American, but he plays the English miser with marvelous ability. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not yet seen this version, I strongly recommend that you do so. Usually it is available for a very small amount of money ... or are you also bad?
