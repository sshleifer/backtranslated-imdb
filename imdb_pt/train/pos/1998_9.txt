In Cinema Retro # 2 magazine, it is revealed that Mark Lester's voice was actually dubbed by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although East was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all pleased with her singing skills. The secret was revealed in a 2004 documentary from the UK titled "Oliver! After They Were Famous". Greene received 400 pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation a secret, as did Mark Lester. They kept the word and only revealed that fact as part of the TV show decades after the release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
