As is often the case, when Britain presents a fun and / or successful Q & A program, the Yankees follow the format and produce their own grossly inferior version. Man About The House, of course, is no exception to this rule. The version of the Yanks (Three's Company) was unacceptable, roles that seem to last forever. An excellent example of quantity quality (non-existent). The original, on the other hand, is a fondly remembered jewel that had the ability (like Fawlty Towers) to pull the plug at precisely the right moment (unlike the 637 episodes of 'hilarity' Three's Company created). Jo was cute, there was a brilliant chemistry among the Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made it all seem so easy, the scripts, though not exactly Oscar Wilde's, were consistently funny and Chrissy was the most beautiful woman on the planet since the Dead Sea was just feeling bad. Nuff said.
