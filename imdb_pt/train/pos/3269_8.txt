CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after learning that she is pregnant. We then see the husband in the sky letting the powers know that he was taken very early and that his wife needs him. He is told that he can return to earth, but not as himself. Flashforward 19 years in which we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) getting ready to graduate from college and find a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) who is actually the reincarnation of his father. The film is a little on the predictable side ... the story goes on everywhere you wait, but it's so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but get involved in the fun. Shepherd has rarely been seen onscreen to best advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. A lovely and lovely costume that will swallow and delight you.
