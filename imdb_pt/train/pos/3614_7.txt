Girlfight is like cooking your grandmother: the same old recipe you experienced a million times before, but somehow turned into something new and fresh. Try and explain the story to people you've never seen before: a young woman on the wrong side of the track tries to improve her situation by taking on boxing while dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and his growing attraction to a male rival. . Watch them roll their eyes at the cliches, and they're right: it's clich√©. However, I was mesmerized by the good performance of this film, due to the excellent acting and the dialogue and the sensitive direction that makes it 'new'. I avoided this in the movies because it sounded like crap, but I did not make the same mistake I made. Definitely worth a look.
