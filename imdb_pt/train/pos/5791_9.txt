This has to be one of my favorite episodes of Twilight Zone, mainly for the interpretation of two solitary souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> The spider-cobbled shops and the rubble-strewn streets are mysterious. Although the parable may be a little heavy for today's drama standards, it is excellent - using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience. , as well as geopolitics, in a timeless way. The whole drama depends only on the shoulders of Bronson and Montgomery, who do not disappoint. May you both rest in peace. <br /> <br /> A true classic.
