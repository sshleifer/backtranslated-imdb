The Plainsman is a fun western, no doubt a classic, which is real to this day. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, no one I know touched her better. Even if it is not historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about Hickok and the time it takes. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that's what DeMille does here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to the Indians by a major manufacturer to make up for the losses he would have to the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the uncomfortable relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious woman, with Hickok a man who killed a lot, also the case of unusual love between Hickok and Calamity all this makes 'The Plainsman' an unconventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which already shows what great actor he would become. Much care was taken to show the original weapons of the time.
