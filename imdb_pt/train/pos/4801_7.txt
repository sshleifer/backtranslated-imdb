I watched this with my whole family at 9 years old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father observing that "this is how it happened-Adam and Eve." I remember vividly the scene where Adam meets Eve, his eyes were blackened. I asked my father why her eyes were blackened and he told her why she was tired and hungry. Not having seen this episode in 45 years, I still remember vividly - the TV broadcasts back and forth with the home planet, scenes of bombs shaking their thirst, with the final scene of the two pulling away, Adam carrying his backpack and Eve following. It may not have been a theatrical work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all those years.
