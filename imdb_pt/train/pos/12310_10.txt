Just read the original story written by Pu in the eighteenth century. Surprisingly, the film does not know very well the original spirit, although the plot has been modified tremendously. The language of the film, the rhythm, the special effect are all hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to match them. The result is pure beauty.
