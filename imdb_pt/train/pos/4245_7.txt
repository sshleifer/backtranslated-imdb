If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar, it should. That's because Anita Loos, who wrote the screenplay here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of media men's jewelry. <br /> <br /> And they are men of means that Jean Harlow seeks. She leaves the hash on the side of the road, run by her mother and stepfather, because she has decided that the best way to make a living is to marry her. Your talents as a chorus girl are limited, but she will be able to trade for that beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey begins with her and her friend Patsy Kelly receiving an invitation to perform at a party played by the millionaire. Lewis Stone. But, unbeknownst to Jean, Stone is only having one last attack before making himself because of the money he should not own. Still she pulls out some trinkets from him that fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore realizes. <br /> <br /> Lionel has fun with this until Jean prepares for his playboy son, Franchot Tone. After that, he is not amused and tries to persuade Jean to climb the family tree. The Girl from Missouri went into production in the middle of adapting the Code, so it came under a peculiar censorship. I have the feeling that we would have seen a much more risky film. Yet Jean Harlow as a younger, sisiosa version of Mae West is always appreciated. What a great comic talent that the woman had, seeing The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss that the world of the film suffered with its death three years later. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Patsy Kelly's cast with Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the success of shorts that Kelly was doing with another famous blonde platinum, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry that Patsy had with Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in a strange accident / suicide / homicide that no satisfactory explanation was ever really given. <br /> <br /> Do not miss The Girl From Missouri, it's brilliant and cheeky, it must be all shiny jewelry.
