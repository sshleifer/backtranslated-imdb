A great movie this, and a shame that gets little attention outside the art circles and students staying up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but works very effectively, the haze between childish fantasy and blunt nightmare is very well erased. The budget seems very low, but for the credit of those involved it does not appear very often. He did not date her either. I was lucky enough to record it on television when it was a few years ago, and it resisted half a dozen views. It's one of those movies that does not please everyone; though, as usual, those with a more thoughtful approach to filmmaking could take full advantage of it. <br /> Charlotte Buerke does a good performance as Anna, the spoiled pampered and it's a shame she seems to have left the acting scene. Cross is also very good, carrying the stature of your character very well within the context of the image. <br /> <br /> There are some genuinely disturbing moments (and I do not say this lightly) in this film, both half-second shocks and longer tensions. Watch with the lights off! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
