When you are in a dark or depressed mood, go watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple daily setting, and it is very encouraging, particularly from a feminist and humanist perspective. <br /> <br /> When you know both the Turkish and Danish languages ​​or the German language, go watch the film in any case. Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, synchronized to German in the translated version, the other half in Turkish, with Danish or German subtitles, respectively. When I saw it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking public proved that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, deplorably, almost always escaped me, being only misinterpreted in the legends. Still, the film is interesting even if you have no knowledge of Turkish. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, the film is playing a lot on the subject of speed and slowness. At first glance, there is so much rapid bodily movement as lightening, making it a fast and hectic movie. In particular, even if this is a Kung Fu movie, watch out for the racing scenes, beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions. But there are also some very slow and emotionally intense scenes. And above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about maturation; still, there is some movement in the characters to: Look closely at the villain Omar, whose part and performance I really enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The contrast of speed and tranquility contributes very well to the depiction of human fury and dignity. - shown at once, in the same characters, at the same time.
