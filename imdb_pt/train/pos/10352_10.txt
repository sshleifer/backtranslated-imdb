Religious fanaticism is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to this. <br /> <br /> A dingo picked up a baby and the mother was sentenced to prison for "killing" her own baby. I do not want to ruin the story for you, but you need to know the basics before you delve into what led this woman to find herself in a prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the movie and find out how deeply rooted human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive all over the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving film with a formidable cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is her native pronunciation, are remarkable. Those with support roles are also very good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See!
