Pecker is a hilarious and funny movie about a small town in Baltimore whose daily routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things". No pretty models, no handsome men, just living hard. This wonderful film mocks the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is a particular scene when a homeless woman who shopped at Pecker's mother shop bought the same exact coat as one of Whitney's art addicts for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This only serves to show you that no matter what kind of money you have, you will not always have good taste. Once again, John Waters sends you an endless spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special effects and celebrity mountains, but give me a "Pecker" or a "Hairspray" (another great John Waters movie) about a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" any day! !
