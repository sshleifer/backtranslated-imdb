I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this kind of movie. A bird that has suffered many "bumps" and has not yet lost faith in humanity and its sense of humor. What is special about this movie is the fact that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and it is not used as a push for a human actor. Also, I like the plot: Paulie tells his lifestyle to a cleaner at the point he hit the bottom of the pit. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci's!) And Cheech Marin, of course, man is humor to me. Ever since I've seen "Up in Smoke," I've enjoyed your naive way of introducing myself, making it a simple and hilarious situation ... I can not help it.
