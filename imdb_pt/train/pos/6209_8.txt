When I first learned that Hal Hartley was making a follow-up to Henry Fool, I was excited (it's been a personal favorite for years), and then I suspected it had something to do with terrorism. Having just seen this, I was surprised to find that it worked, while it was still a completely different kind of movie from Henry Fool. The writing and direction were dead and the performance was superb ... special praise goes to Hartley for tracing virtually the entire cast, even to Henry's son, who was only four years old in the original. As I said though, this film is quite different from the first, but it works: I reconciled myself with the change of tone and subject to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film finished. In this case, an unexpected adventure follows ... and that's all I'm going to give ... not to mention the fact that I'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's crossing twice with who . Although it was certainly one of the best movies I've seen in a while, it suffers as many sequences with its ending as it seems that Hartley is planning a third now and the movie leaves you hanging. I buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
