Enveloping, fascinating tale of the captured US Army captain who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman. Paul Ryker avoids friendly fire in an apparently doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. In the vein of classic court dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-crafted mystery, expertly guided by an excellent cast, the constant impetus of director Kulik, and effective twists and turns. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964, and subsequently reinforced by this review with the presence of many "name" actors and some action sequences. Dillman, rewriting his role, is right as the doubting defense lawyer, whose attentions sometimes stray into the personal situation of Ryker's supportive wife, though a little distant, played with aplomb by Vera Miles. Rounding out the frontline is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in important supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of Paul Ryker's character is a balanced description of a simple but dedicated man's back behavior is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin changes perfectly from resigned indifference, passionate determination, giving a convincing, often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place in the best lists of courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> However, despite its apparent obscurity, "Sergeant Ryker" still remains tense and convincing examination, like a book you simply can not put down. Highly recommended.
