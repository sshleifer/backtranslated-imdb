Refreshing jewel 'lost'! Featuring effective dialogue combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and envelop you enough to care what happens to them. The characters of Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is your usual evil presence. Widmark won the stalker fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a "logical" ending and a long chase on foot that embarrasses the exaggerated pursuit sequences of contemporary Hollywood. You know how this will probably end, but suspense and interest are sustained everywhere. The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you've ever seen. The movie seems to slow down a bit beyond the middle, but stick with it to the rewarding conclusion.
