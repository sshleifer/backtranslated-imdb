Revived at the World Premiere Screening September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This had an interesting premise, but it seemed to take too long with too many shots. (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc. shipped to China per tonne and then classified and transformed into new products to be sold) and another desolation. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to get more interviews from people to boost the human element, but were often prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was interesting. The pieces of a Shanghai real estate agent exhibiting and displaying its luxurious mansion and gardens, interspersed with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially remarkable. The opening screening of a 480-meter factory floor was also such a thing. Scenes from the Three Gorges Dam project activity also complemented Jia Khang-je's TIFF films (the Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and the Dong documentary) which were also built around this subject. Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick of Pencier, director of photography Peter Mettler and the guy Edward Burtynsky were all onstage for a question-and-answer session after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced by the audience and was thanked as the most important person who helped access land in China itself.
