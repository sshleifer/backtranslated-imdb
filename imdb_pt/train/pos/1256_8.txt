This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie. There are many twists and turns. The story or director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the excellent sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this do not miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I were given 8/10.
