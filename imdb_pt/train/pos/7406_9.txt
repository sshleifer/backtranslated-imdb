Very different topic dealt with in this movie. A direct and simple description of local Chinese customs, looking at the daily operation of a public bath, run by the old owner and his retarded son, when the eldest son returns home, mistakenly believing that his father died. As every man in the city makes his daily visit to talk, play, discuss personal matters and get honest advice, in addition to the usual spa therapies. When the elderly man dies, strong and loyal family ties cause the eldest son to take control, so that the operation of the public bath is not interrupted. And finally, the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and get along. The public bath has to be demolished, giving way to a commercial complex to be built.
