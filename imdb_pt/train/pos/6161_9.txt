Set during World War II, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for children starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evacuees and a 'Professor of Witchcraft', thwarts a Nazi invasion . <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with lots of laughs, this movie will delight children of all ages with their great characters, exciting stories and captivating melodies. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children to the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are equally impressive as the Cockney. rascals who help in the fight against the unpleasant Hun. <br /> <br /> Special effects are a bit dated, but let's face it, kids do not care much about these things, as long as they are entertained. And entertained, they will be. With some stunning scenes that blend brilliantly live action and animation with great effect, and movie magic more genuine than a hundred Harry Potter, it would be hard not to take advantage of this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, just a fairly extensive musical number on Portobello Road spoils the perfection of the movie, but with so much more to enjoy, it can be easily forgiven. <br /> <br /> And in addition, any film with British television The legend of Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry spiv style is guaranteed a good rating of me.
