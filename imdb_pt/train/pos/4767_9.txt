I do not see how this show is like the CO at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, the CO revolves around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life. North Shore is about a hotel staff that is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Second, the OC occurs in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox do a show like one of your other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show with good actors most of the time. It has a good plot and plot. I like the events that happen and how people take care of them and work with them. The most recent episode was surprising how the story worked. It was not predictable like most stories at most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it up.
