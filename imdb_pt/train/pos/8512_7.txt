I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and have not seen him yet, but I shudder at the thought of someone actually paying to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did that year. The thing is they probably edited it. Especially the scene where my roommate was sniffing coke from the breasts of a Mexican prostitute (they probably should have followed him). We made some appearances, but besides, I can not remember anything. I was the MC in some scenes (from what I've been told.) What I can tell you is that everyone has avoided the film crew since they want to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her boobs to the world the loser girl lost her virginity.) Overall, the trip itself was crazy, but people act differently when the camera is on them.
