I liked this TV show because it was the very thing that a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday discovers that she is a witch and she lives with her aunts in the house and both are witches too. Well, that took about a few weeks to get used to. When she first used her powers, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to go back in time and repeat one day. This series is really cool and is a typical series of teenagers but it got worn when she moved house and into an apartment with her college friends and then got bored and I stopped watching.I loved her aunts that they were so funny and the other one was really dumb. I loved Valerie and hated Sabrina's enemy Libby, she was ugly.
