I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Provides a view of something I barely understand - surfers surf because that's all they want to do; Nothing seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a life for these guys. * Buried in the movie is a great surfing story; I've never surfed, but I love surfing movies and I've seen many. Nobody taught me what this movie did. * The film was very well edited. That flowed well. The interviews were excellent * It's interesting from beginning to end. In summary, it's as good as a documentary as I've seen, so I have to evaluate in terms of that. Then 10/10
