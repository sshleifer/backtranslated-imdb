I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a short time ago, and since then I have been watching all of his films that come to my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he looks a bit like Owen) that just leaves the screen. I'm sure that if he gets some fleshy papers, he'll break an Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> That's not to denigrate this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, with very believable people (well, it's based on the first mischief of the author with rockets), a great cast ?? Chris Cooper is always good, and is Laura Dern always on my watch list? with the appropriate combination of humor, excitement, excitement ... and the great soundtrack with so many rock n 'oldies to get your feet. <br /> <br /> But this movie had a very special meaning for me. : in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked at the night stars to watch the Sputnik as it crossed the darkness; like Homer too, tried rockets in my backyard and even used the same fuel chemicals; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts at explosive disaster! Which was fun ... <br /> <br /> I did not reach its great heights (metaphorical and physical). But that's what you discover when you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a basic family movie, but it looks like it's an endangered breed. Take the time to see it with the kids: you all will have lots of good laughs.
