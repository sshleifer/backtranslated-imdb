Diane Keaton did a great job in this sad but funny story that involved some young people and their deep and dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone," 05, who had a single daughter and loved her beyond words can describe. She would always call her and say, "Deliver Dorothy," which was an expression used in the "Wizard of Oz" in 1939. A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie becomes deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie investigates, more truths she discovers about herself and her true relationship with her daughter. Great movie to see and enjoy, especially all the good acting of all the supporting actors.
