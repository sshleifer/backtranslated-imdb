This movie is very hilarious, and has a large compilation of actors like William H. Macy, who always performed that kind of role, perhaps his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney who is a very good actor showing his work comedian in Cohen brothers movie "Oh brother, where are you?" which results in being one of my favorite movies ever! But it has been hard to find "Welcome to Collinwood" here in Mexico. My city does not have good places to buy good movies. I tried to buy at Blockbuster, but they do not know by the original name, so maybe it's a little easier to find if I have the name they gave in Mexico, does anyone know this? Because I can not remember! Cheers. AN.
