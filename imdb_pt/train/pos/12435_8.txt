I had the pleasure of seeing that she had black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years and have been disgusted by the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the writers updated the period to include a computer, he did not. t spoil everything. In fact, I watched the movie twice in one day, a clear sign that everything was in line with the pattern. This is what I do with books that I like too. <br /> <br /> I thought all the characters were well represented and represented the beginnings of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evidenced both in book and in comic books. I would also have to disagree with a comment made by a previous reviewer about the bad guys having to be ugly. Did he actually read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very good and look forward to the sequels.
