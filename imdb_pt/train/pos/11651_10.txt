WHEN FRIENDLY KILLING, in my opinion, is a moving and moving drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Every time Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) vomited, I wanted to vomit. It's kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I enjoyed watching them do things together as well as being lectured by their parents. Before concluding, I would like to say, "If you ask me, WHEN FRIENDLY FRIENDS really show how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who has not seen it. You have a few tears and a good time, so the next time you go on TV, relax with a friend and watch.
