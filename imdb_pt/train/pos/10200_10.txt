All I hear is how badly the animation is done. It may not live up to what everyone expects, but look at it that way. Would you expect perfection in hell? I believe the animation was done in a dry and sandy way on purpose. It was great to see the transformation of your character in this movie, considering that it will probably be the closest to the live action that we will get. I expect a sequel very soon. If we want live action, I think we can be better off with chastity or purgatori. I do not think Lady Death moved well to the movies. But be that as it may, it is my personal conviction that all opponents about this movie are Wrong DEAD. No pun intended.
