The Europe of Lars von Trier is an echo worthy of The Third Man, about an American who comes to Europe after World War II and finds himself involved in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as the war ends to work with his uncle as conductor of car sleeping at Zentropa Railway. What he does not know is that the war is still secretly going on with a clandestine terrorist group called Werewolves that targets American allies. Leopold is strongly opposed to taking either side, but is attracted and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the owner of the railway company. His father was a Nazi sympathizer, but is forgiven by US Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help the German transport system to function again. The colonel soon enlists, or forces, Leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves could attack the trains. Soon Leopold is stuck on an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and noir-ish movie where everyone and everything is not what it seems. It's amazing to watch the naive Leopold deal with everything (his mistress, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even railway company officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally overflows and takes humor with violence. to control. The film is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed elegantly, always happens at night during the winter with lots of snow falling. His black and white shot with shots of random color appearing everywhere. In addition, the background screens displaying images that are counted will act with the images on the front. Add the hypnotic narration of Max von Sydow, and Europe becomes a dream place that is out of this world. <br /> <br /> This is now one of my favorite movies.
