As a former Okinawan karate world champion, I like movies about sacrifice for sport. But this movie is about so much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently been plagued by very serious injuries and a lack of disastrous passion. Almost lights off for me. And this little silly movie touched me so deeply that, as in a torpor, it reminded me of how life should be. This is a movie about life. Living your life for yourself and respect for others. Fortification. God bless Bend it like Beckham I believe it's a real gem.
