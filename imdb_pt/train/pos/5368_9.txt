This is an incredible action movie with great Arnie! It is done in style, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied. The characters were incredible, and Richard Dawson is very menacing as the main villain. Yes, it has tons of holes, however, it's highly entertaining with a great finish too. It also had a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. The development of the character was also very good, with some superb performances. The steering is great! Paul Michael Glaser, does a pretty good job here, with the incredible use of color, keeping him stylish everywhere, great camera angles, and generally keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. There's a little blood. We received some wounds of bloody bullets, exploding head, chopped throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood and impalement. The acting is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING, as always, he is excellent in the acting department, has tons of hilarious costumes, kicks that ass and, as always, is a great physical presence !, and it was so much fun watching! (Rules of Arnie!) Maria Conchita Alonso, does well here, she was very cute and had good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, it's decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, he 's good as the geek guy, he was cool!. Richard Dawson is amazing as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers. A must see! **** 1/2 of 5
