There have been many films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to garner support for our troops from the public. Seen today, some may reject them or just see them as propaganda - what they are technically, but of a positive kind and destined to unify the nation. This film is a very effective and fun example of the genre - to have a very realistic script and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays practically the same character he played in MANY other films (you know, the tough guy, but the "swell guy"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the other extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the training bombers). While the story is reminiscent of several other films about our pilots and crews, the film is well crafted to make it interesting and not very unlikely. That, perhaps, except at the end - where the film is a little overdone, but also VERY satisfying. About the only serious negative, and this is mainly for nitpickers, is that some of the footage is a bit loosely integrated into the movie and "crazy" like me who are history teachers and airplane lovers will probably realize this - will notice
