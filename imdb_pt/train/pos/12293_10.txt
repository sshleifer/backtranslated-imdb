This is an excellent movie, and it is the kind of treasure that can only be captured through sporadic movie screenings, as it is not available on video / DVD. The way the movie begins with the two lovers coming up, and ends with them coming out (although quite happens in the middle, and they do not stay in one place during this time), gives you a feeling of closure and a feeling that everything is right with the world. If you get the chance to see this movie then do it. I can not wait to see it again, and I wish it could be released in general.
