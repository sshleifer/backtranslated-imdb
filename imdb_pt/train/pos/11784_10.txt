As has been well documented by previous posters, the true stars of Rockstar: INXS - and, in fact, their sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Do not know who they are? They are the incredible and tight House Band whose musical talent and talent made it something more than a sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the night of the "strings"? That was precision and musical perfection, if I ever saw it. The epic interpretation of Suzie McNeil's "Bohemian Rhapsody" to Stones' memorable cover "You Can not Always Get ..." by JD Fortune singing "Suspicious Minds." The common denominator here is the amazing House Band. As INXS was at its peak, they are unfortunately a shadow of their old selves, although JD's live performance has given a new life to their music, this show is about the HB. <br /> <br /> Memorandum for producers: The third season (if we're blessed enough to happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get these boys a good vocalist and they are going places.
