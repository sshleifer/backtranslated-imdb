THE UNIT OF MULHOLLAND made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not just a filmmaker. His stories and style have a spell that crosses the screen. So, THE STRAIGHT HISTORY was a big surprise to me, with its easy-to-follow story and sunny sets. Still, Lynch is there, and while it's far from being his best, it's a movie not to be missed. The performance of the late Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
