Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and irresistibly charming Emma in this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I sometimes doubted that the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: for, honestly, she is so terribly hypocritical and intriguing that she is tempted to dislike her seriously. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation, however, saves Emma from herself so to speak: she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in view, and one can not help but give in and love (not to say love) of her despite of his less than agreeable qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only one, which is why this TV series is so delicious; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing to the maximum the personal magnetism of the character (which is even more remarkable because that paper was not very well treated by Ewan McGregor in the film adaptation of Emma in 1996), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. This production is, in short, a great achievement and one to see often with increasing pleasure.
