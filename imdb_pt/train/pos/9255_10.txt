If you want a fun joke with a lot of subtle humor then you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone would not like this. Accept what it is: A vehicle for Dennis Hopper shakes his head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and stands out in this - better than any Baywatch episode - and shows a subtle mood. Too bad she did not have many opportunities to expand this. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits perfectly into his role as "Royal Navy" and William McNamara does a solid job as a cheater. <br /> <br /> Play on a walk-by by Hopper in the middle of the chase for "The Cherry in this Sundae" and you have a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing. I bought this so it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain-sweet.
