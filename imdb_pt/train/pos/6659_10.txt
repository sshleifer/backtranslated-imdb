It takes courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, in which he is not shown as a man who could not do anything wrong. This movie shows how a Mahatma could not be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are great, the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous, but the movie trails. If the intention was to make this movie without any box office expectation, which I assume is the case here, then it's a brilliant attempt, but if the manufacturers expected it to be a commercial success then the fate of the movie was doomed on that they chose this subject. <br /> <br /> 20 years from now, this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrait of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this ... And honestly, yours is not the only show that deserves to be applauded, Shefali Chhaya is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> See the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death. <br /> <br /> There are no dialogues, no shout, but a wordless shot by Khanna. <br /> <br /> It is one of the best scenes ever filmed in the history of Cinema < > <br /> Gandhi, My Father is not at all exciting cinema, but rather, his excellent cinema and a must watch. Bright Try ..
