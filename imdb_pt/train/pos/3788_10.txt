This movie is beautiful. It is real and sad, but at the same time totally crazy. The characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have so many different minds, but each of us could refer at least onwards. In Canada, we do not have many Eastern European films, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go see Loners.
