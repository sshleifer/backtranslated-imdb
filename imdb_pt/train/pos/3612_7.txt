Michelle Rodriguez is a well-established high school veteran who discovers she has strong power and starts amateur training at a gym in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, little older than her, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and are attracted to one another. No sex. Santiago was instructed to save him for his next fight. <br /> <br /> Both are participants in a "blind to gender" sports program that makes no distinction between men and women, a misguided attempt to level the athletic field. A conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I'm not making this up - "Let's face it, the president is black." I am here to make an equally astute observation - "Men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases of 100, this does not need to make a difference in physical performance. But in the first percent - trained athletes whose skills have been perfected - men usually have the upper hand. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have greater muscle mass and strength in the upper torso. These differences in the constitution of the body enable women to give birth and raise children and for men to pick up and kill them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection. Without that, there may be no human beings. And that, boys and girls, is why they have men's events and women's events in the Olympics. I talk to you as your anthropologist. That will be ten cents, PayPal preferred. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this wrong blind genre program. As a talented boxer like Rodrigues is, as she approaches the heyday of the game, she will eventually lose to a man. <br /> <br /> That's where the complication comes in this movie. Rodrigues is finally compared to her boyfriend Douglas. Neither wants to lose the other's anger, not to mention roundhouse rights, but their pride is at stake, and pride is personal and gender-related. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what she sees as her paternalistic attitude. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I was not really expecting much from the movie. I thought it would be a steal from Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" until I discovered that it was released years earlier. And I've never heard of the director or any of the artists. This kind of obscurity often makes people cry poorly, and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised at how this is organized. The total absence of bathos left me open-mouthed. The same thing happened with the minimal use of boxing cliches - the worn ropes, the blood, the cut of the swollen eye, the shabby faces, the fat, sweaty spectator shouting "Kill him!", The slow landing of the nose glove, the spray of sweat from the battered head, the heroic music signaling the long awaited apotheosis of the victor. None of this here - well, almost none. The entire plot could be considered stereotyped. Hard boy finds exit in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling you feel is that it's probably that kind of amateur competition. Different from the ones we see on TV and in ordinary movies. No bell rings, for example, instead a referee who dances and watches screams "Stop!" And "Box!" Competitors use head gear. The academy is not occupied by a crowd of spectators, but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the events. It's a clean film, despite the gloomy atmosphere and the unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez may look pretty mean, with muscle mass and eyes glistening under the lowered eyebrows, but when you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can hit you whenever you want, and once you hear the feminine contours of your supersegmentals, it is not bad. (A scene in which she hits her father on the floor is exaggerating.) It was a bit difficult to understand Douglas's restraint when Rodriguez crawled on him in bed. The director, Karyn Kusama, chose her talent with care. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with some talent, imagination and a little money. There should be more movies like that. Take one of those billion dollar blockbusters filled with dinosaurs or spaceships and spread the bounty a little.
