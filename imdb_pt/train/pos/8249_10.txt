Oh my. This movie really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle. Truly an incredible man, if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman / killer, and then finally in Fido as a zombie! Your character in Fido looks cute to scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not either! Bouncing on the career of Matrix and Moment as a darker character, for a conservative housewife of 1950! Rare nowadays to see actors being able to not be so molded. <br /> <br /> Now in the story (no spoilers, do not worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (Author of Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z) happy with joy! Finally, a well-made twist of zombies and comedies. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you are bored, or if you are too busy, go see this movie!
