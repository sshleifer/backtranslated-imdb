I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it puzzles me as this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well, not really, because this movie is all that a Hollywood movie is not - original, creative, quirky and humorous. It seems like no one really wants to see this kind of movie today, because, in the simplest terms, it does not conform to the generic conventions that most young viewers look for in a movie. <br /> <br /> I've written a review for IMDb for centuries, but I was inclined to give this movie a special mention, even if it's during my 30-minute break between classes! Essentially, it is not about anything, since the two main characters are plunged into their own world out of nothing through the hatred of the world. The glow here is how the director sustains interest for most of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half house and a vast empty white space. This is due in no small part to the actors' stellar performances, which offer great laughs and, at the same time, add significant emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I'd love to write some more, but I'm on a time limit. However, I encourage everyone and everyone who experiences this movie. A unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well executed way, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, a pleasant sound and (quite) impressive visuals, creating a very entertaining film. <br /> /> Too bad that few people know anything ...
