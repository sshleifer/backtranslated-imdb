The police story is an impressive series of scenarios for Jackie Chan to show off their talents and bravery. Some of the action scenes here are among the best and most dangerous of Jackie's that the whole end of the fight at the mall is probably Jackie's biggest fight sequence, more brutal and less comical than saying Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of But unfortunately the rest of the film does not hold up to this quality as it is a somewhat stupid police thriller with some elements of comedy. I always prefer JC in films like Project A, where his natural comedic talents shine. In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story, this just does not work for me. That said, although this is still up there with the best Jackies films, due to the incredible stunt work and the show. <br /> <br /> As always, Hong Kong films avoid the DVD version dubbed in English as it is really horrible. the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Great acrobatics, OK movie a good starting point if you have not seen a JC movie before and it is worth watching any movie fan 7/10
