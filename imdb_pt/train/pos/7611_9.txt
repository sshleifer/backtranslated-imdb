"I looked into the eyes of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters of ABC's award-winning TV show, "Lost." The series could be summed up as a drama story about a group of survivors of an airplane crash stranded on an unknown island, but that would be a disservice. "Lost" follows a large group of characters that conflict with the island, with each other and finally themselves as they struggle with their new lifestyle and their dependence on one another. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not an ordinary island - and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories that they could tell us after a certain period, but this proved to be unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. The island is a character by itself, and to understand this comment you would have to see the series by yourself, which only serves to show its originality and grandeur. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this, review, only the first two seasons went on the air, and they are full of strong episodes. My only moderate criticism is that the second season seems to decelerate a bit in the middle of the road, but fortunately it returns in a form admirable for the final episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend a television series, you should be doing it right now, surely that would be it. If you like excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful locations, and an island that looks more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
