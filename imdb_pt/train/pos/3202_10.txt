I can not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why do they think it's too bad, and so on. It is not worse than anything else out there. Personally I think "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than most other films of the same genre. Reasons why I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, screenplay (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects, and direction (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think this is the best work I've ever seen from director Paul Anderson, who has directed the entertainment "Mortal Kombat" and the not-so-fun "Event Horizon."
