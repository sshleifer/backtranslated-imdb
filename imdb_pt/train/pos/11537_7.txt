Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives to WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposing types in The ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of two Incompatible friends sharing an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar, engaged in suicide after his wife's divorce and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau), with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says and does drives Oscar up and neither can bear the other's way, with Oscar being the most clunky man imaginable and Felix the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene for me was when the giggles The pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them at a dinner party. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put him in points. The talented Pigeon sisters are the girls who made the voices of Gabble Sisters (a pair of geese) in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here - their comedic timing at the top of Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to make the film into hilarity . where it remains most of the time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and enjoyed other screen treatments of your work, this is not to be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are perfect (despite considering switching roles before filming starts), and of course it's easy to see why this became a well-liked TV show later. <br /> <br /> In short: Top Comedy Simon, not to be missed.
