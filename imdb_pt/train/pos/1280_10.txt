I was lucky enough to have seen it on a whim during a film festival and it was so hard with what I saw that I came back the next night for the second of three sessions. A funny, savage and sharp attack on every aspect of conventionally engulfed entertainment without tasting by the smaller target audience of the common denominator undertaken by a lone journalist who slowly absorbs members for his guerrilla war against predictability is what the movie is all about, and runs in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you are left behind after the credits roll with renewed, and hope excited that the original movies can still be made. Anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations of something to brighten their imaginations would do well to hunt (and I mean, hunt) that ill-seen item. For Fight Club fans and any Charlie Kaufman movie, it required viewing for anyone who avoided multiplexes like a rabid dog.
