George Stevens, an engaging adventure director (before devoting himself to more serious programs such as I REMEMBER MAMA, 1948, and GIANT, 1956) set the standard for all future strands of action to follow. Vaguely based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers in nineteenth-century India. The noble trio must face a series of battles and several other dangers, including a cult thuggee and a temple full of gold. His onscreen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades, and have inspired much of everything from the cliffhanger-inspired STAR WARS (1977) to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). The biggest reason for the success of the film, however, are the perfect performances of the trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen has rarely been better as the toughest tough guy, Cary Grant is the best of comics, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr is as insightful a hero as he can imagine - maybe even more than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and such warm and compelling camaraderie is precisely what is lacking in most modern action shots - and they get tremendous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe who overcomes the obvious miscellaneous physics and does the title character a beacon of human sweetness and quiet strength. A great success at the time (the film was supposed to be the second largest money maker of 1939, behind the outrageously successful GONE WITH THE WIND), and remains undoubtedly the best film of its kind.
