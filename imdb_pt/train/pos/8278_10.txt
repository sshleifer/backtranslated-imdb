If you want the Scream or something like the horror product from the big studio that we forced ourselves into today, do not bother. This well-written film kept me thinking of all I had to say. Importance of the myth in our lives to make sense, how children interpret the world (and violence in it), our plundering of the environment and the ignorance of its history and legends ... all here but not directly on the surface. You could technically call it "monster movie," even though Wendigo does not take physical form to the end, and so it's up to you and your beliefs about what's going on with the legendary spirit / beast. Some standard suspense elements for those looking for just the basics and the movie never bored, though in fact the less you see the creature the better. Fessenden successfully continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us scared.
