Huge fun for adults and children, this movie works on many levels: there's everything from car crashes and face-up to very good (but subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> Glenn Close is in her sublimely evil best as Cruella (`call me Ella ') De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years at Dr. Pavlov's Behavior Modification Clinic, is she cured of her desire for skin? even the doggie hair she had longed for. She still has all her fur coats placed in the extraordinary castle dungeon she inhabits. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a "Dalmatian" movie without Cruella's subterfuge and machinations and you know that something will change your behavior modification. And now she needs an extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is instantly attractive as the hero of the movie that runs the 'Second Chance' puppy shelter. Although he was in 'Titanic' and last year's television version (as Pip) of 'Great Expectations' I did not recognize him; well, he was the fifth official Lowe 'on Titanic and I did not see' Great Expectations', so I'm not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a delightful spin as a pawn. by Cruella. Does he dance and stance in the most extravagant and outrageous skin clothing you've ever seen? and does well. His homage to 'Wicked Witch of the West' is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella's not-so-evil henchman? he was also Alonzo, Cruella's steward, in "101 Dalmatians" and you can also recognize him from all the "Black Adder" Brit-Coms. He plays his usual clumsy character, kind hearted, a little stupid, with great effect. <br /> <br /> The costumes Oscar is generally given to the totality of the costumes in a film. Is that unfortunate how the clothing worn by Glenn Close is incredible? is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she's being released from Behavior Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an exaggerated character. His clothes deserve at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Does animation have a special place in my heart? but comparing this movie with the original animated movie is like comparing apples to orangutans: this can not be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" is even better than the film version of "101 Dalmatians" launched in 1996. There is much to like here: from jokes of vision, dialogue and costumes to cast. It's a good movie for the whole family.
