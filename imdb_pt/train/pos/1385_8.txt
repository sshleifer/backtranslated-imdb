I saw it at the MK2 Cinema Hautefeuille just one night after its first public screening in Paris. A very beautiful film about three 15 year old teenagers, all of them roughly in the same psychological phases. Many of the scenes allow us to return to our adolescence and our first feelings about sexual intercourse. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the girls' first strong sensual feelings to lesbianism, but even then it does not corrupt the likelihood of the story. Sometimes you may find the film a little slow, but it's what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance young talented actresses, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many little details, but this film also allowed me to find out what synchronized swimming is: impressing!
