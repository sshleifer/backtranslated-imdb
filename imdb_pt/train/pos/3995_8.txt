Kureishi was not exactly blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. Recent transvestites such as "Intimacy" have ruined great writings. But the Mother surpasses all her previous incarnations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundry. A middle-aged woman beats the widow by having a very carnal relationship with her emotionally weak daughter's boyfriend. The fact that you believe in all this is credit for the quality of acting as it is for the finite present of writing. And in Daniel Craig we have a brave, bold and rude anti-hero who denies the public that they will ever question why a young stallion would think about sleeping with a flabby grandmother. Beautifully filmed, the film fails only in the weak representation of peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it is a winner.
