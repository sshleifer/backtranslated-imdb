The concept of having Laurel & Hardy, this time in the role of chimney sweepers, is surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, especially Stan Laurel, as always. <br /> <br /> The film also has a subplot with a crazy professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It does not sound like a logical mix of plots and incoherent, but both plots fit perfectly into the memorable end. It's still a little weird, but it's funny anyway, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of the film is amazing. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the wacky teacher. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of excellent timed and hilarious built sequences, which are all quite predictable, but become hilarious to watch, however, thanks to the way they run. All of this helps make "Dirty Work" one of Laurel & Hardy's best shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
