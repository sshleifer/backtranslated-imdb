Threw in the car through the windshield, someone is playing another song for someone, another person did not react, according to the voice. I just wonder how this came to be. There were so many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how a camera was there. If the scenes filmed where the Warhols came down in a post-BJM party are true, then this was an inexcusable exploitation to the fullest, if not then it was a total invention, anyway it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way through this movie I was wondering how the pictures happened. Taken seriously, a beautiful portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe to be.
