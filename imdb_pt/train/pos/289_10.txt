I love all Michael Landon Jr. movies and Michael Landon Jr's cast of Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not be better. Dale Midkiff has the ways to get this character out. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me spellbound from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of the Missie & Willies girl with Clarks time the visit was just God's time. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them do so was the love of a father. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies before this [Love Comes Softly, Love the Lasting Promise and Long Lasting Journey], I feel that you can see this movie and understand it easily. I still go out and want to see the 3 previous films, due to the story that all the characters have behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I look forward to many more of his films in the future.
