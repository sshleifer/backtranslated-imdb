OK, I overestimated a little to make up for at least one of those sullen comments. But I liked that. I did not laugh out loud, but he held my interest and pulled me along without letting me fall at any moment. The history built. Yes, you knew you would have a happy ending - that genre always does. In the meantime, it was peculiar with gags that you could lose, so pay attention when watching. Stiller and Black handed over skillfully yet again. Good team. They should work together more. I do not know that it will be a cult classic, but it certainly was a fun ride. Not as good as what about BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is it? It's still worth getting out of your way to watch this movie.
