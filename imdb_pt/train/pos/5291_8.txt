It's only been a week since I saw my first John Waters movie (Female Trouble), and I was not sure what to expect the second time. While the previous film was scandalously over the top, Pecker is actually a funny movie that satirizes art critics in New York with a T. Anyone who can not imagine what these "experts" think so enticing in modern art, you'll love seeing these pretentious snobs so full of themselves over Pecker, a boy who has just found a broken camera and begins filming his friends and neighbors. Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, The Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There was not much meat in any of the roles in this movie, but it really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes up with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a defining year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, the opposite of sex and Pecker.) <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, was also a significant part of The Movie and really made it enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of funny scenes, but I have to say the best was when a crown meets up screaming: "We want weed!" "We want weed!" I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the cops taking off the dancer. I'm going to have to look for more of Waters' work, especially Hairspray, now that's the news.
