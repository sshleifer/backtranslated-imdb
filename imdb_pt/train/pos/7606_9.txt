The first series of Lost began with a crash ... literally and slowly slowed down. That may have taken some viewers off, and people who started watching half way would be bored or just plain confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise new people in the Lost world to simply watch from the beginning and not be fooled by the slower episodes. The acting is excellent, but why the 5 series planned ... WHY ??? All this means there will be no answers for at least four years, oh, well, I'll keep watching if that keeps the tension and dialogue flowing.
