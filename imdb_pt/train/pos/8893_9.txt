The 60's is a well-balanced miniseries between historical facts and a good storyline. In four deliveries, we followed a US family, with 3 members. But we do not just see them. We also follow the story of various characters such as a black reverend, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is simply extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some scenes from the Vietnam War between scenes. The next chapter does not begin where the last chapter ends, starts some time later, giving us a little mystery about what happened. In general, the 60's miniseries is a must-see not only for hippie fanatics, but for everyone with little curiosity on the subject.
