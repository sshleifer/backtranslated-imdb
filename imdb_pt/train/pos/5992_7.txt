I admit I had no idea what to expect before seeing this highly stylized piece. It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all I knew. It started with great visuals, short stretches to get your attention and make your imagination run wild. As I continued, I quickly learned through the narration of what was happening. A good neo noir story that I felt was not a waistline of a few minutes of my time. The little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment while composing the plot. Along with a nice twist in the end is a legal package in general. The score, though not bad, gave the film almost a sensation of music video. I felt a bit old-fashioned, adding nothing to deepen the plot. Some of the presentations seemed overly dramatic, but they fit perfectly into the feel of the piece as a whole. I walk away from that very satisfied. I was given a lot of information in a short period of time, but through great editing and voice-over work, I did not feel rushed or pushed. Good job!
