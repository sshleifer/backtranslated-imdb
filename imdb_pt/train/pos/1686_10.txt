After a long, hard week behind the table, making all these serious decisions, this movie is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio broadcast, this movie will take you to a land of alien and sci-fi humor. Captain Zippo died in the great load of the Buick. He was a brave man. Jack Nicholson's prints shine through that alien face with the dark sunglasses and leather jacket. And always remember to be careful with the 'donut of death'! Keep in mind that the number one rule in this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and 'Prepare for the Earth Scum!' You just have to see for yourself.
