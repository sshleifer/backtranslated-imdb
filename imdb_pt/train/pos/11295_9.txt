This movie has always been my favorite since I saw him as a 12-year-old boy in 1962 when he was shown on a Los Angeles television show. The characters have been very exciting since the beginning of the scene, and it's a shame the film has never been released for video tapes, nor is it shown on television (apparently due to a ban on the property of Moss Hart, the playwright). / producer / director who wrote the story and first performed it on the New York stage during World War II - the reason for denying its showing is difficult to understand more than 50 years after it was made). I have not seen the movie again for over 30 years, when someone who actually had been a big cast member got a "pirated" copy on VHS (poor video quality, but good audio). My recollection was correct: it was still a fascinating and engaging movie to watch. An astounding aspect of this film is just how many of its stars, just beginning in their careers in the 1944 era), went on to become big movie stars or at least well-known and fully employed actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O ' Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are great, especially the close-up photos, where the details of the giant 4-engined bomber (for now) (then 18,000+ fabricated, now almost extinct) can be seen. A good view of the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew (of course, MENTIONED by gender as was the trend of the day: only MEN became pilots, them in their roles - hardly acceptable in today's world). I hope one day will be released on video for a new generation to enjoy.
