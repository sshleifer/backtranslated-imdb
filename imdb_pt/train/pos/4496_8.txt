Put simply, I liked this movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was not related to anything other than the subject itself. I had heard stories of my mother and grandmother about how the working-class lives and attitudes of northern England used to be (as experienced by them) and this is an interesting representation that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular, the paternalistic but arrogant father who "knows" what is best for his family, along with his stubbornness, when this paradigm is challenged. (Not much has changed there then !!) <br /> <br /> People who saw the play will probably be disappointed by the film because the story is not easily transferred through the different media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, even if only by the way it conveyed a social phenomenon.
