I read the negative comments before seeing this movie and did not get discouraged, I went ahead and started watching. I admit that I have had to step back a few times, since the film is incredibly complex, involved and full of details. This is a good thing, but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, gratuitous sex and violence in general that replace the development of plots and characters. In fact, what a welcome departure, however, I am so accustomed to not paying much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character development and plot; the kind we used to analyze when I was in high school. It requires real mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a legal change. I would compare this to 'All the President's Men' in terms of the generic subject. That is, it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with sufficient influence over employees to essentially 'own' them. <br /> <br /> Unlike 'All the President's Men', this film makes an effort to give the real personality of some characters. In this sense, the film is a study of characters like 'The Negotiator', with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this film, his characters are city officials and the plot is extremely intense. However, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to cooperate, trust each other, and ultimately unite against the corrupt Police Department. There are more shots in this movie and the specific plot is different, but generically, there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the City Hall demands much more concentration. In fact, I was struck by how much it paralleled the past and present political scandals that I saw in my life returning to Watergate. The thing is, the public knows something is wrong, for sure! but following the details is difficult to do. This movie is nowhere near as complex as real life, but in fact it is realistic for life in its complexity. I think that's one of the reasons the previous posters criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If someone observes this knowing what they are about to see and is up to the experience, it is really excellent! I watched it three times in a row! The acting is superb and the direction is impeccable. The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.
