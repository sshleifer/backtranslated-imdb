I have not seen this movie! At least not in its entirety. I saw some amazing clips that left me gagging to see everything. A sequence remains in my memory to this day. A spaceship (very convincing) is orbiting the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash device to photograph the hidden surface below it. The moon flashes in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds there it is. Lines parallel, square, Could be .. then the light fades and the brief glimpse of ... what ... is gone and it's time for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've seen a few other clips as well but would like to get the full movie.
