The filmmaker aspired to Andy Goldsworthy's art, his quest for closeness to land and water, and his sense of proportion - and so kindly, so beautifully, breathed back to film the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" adores Goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in the sight of everyone. Watch this movie!
