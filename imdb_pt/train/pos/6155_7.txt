"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, although not one of the best works of Disney. It has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and enchanting special effects, good scenery and lovely landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines live action and animation very well. The animation itself is, of course, very good. The animation is very reminiscent of the 1973 Robin Hood film and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are many wildlife such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like Robin Hood. "In addition, the King (a lion) seems to be a mixture of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear resembles Little John. <br /> <br /> This film is often compared to" (Carrie, Charlie, and Paul are cute), and they have both their own magic and a magical woman. a little bit like Banks' children.Two movies were directed by Robert Stevenson and both cast David Tomlinson.But instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a more cheerful and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne "The Age of Not Believing," and "The Beautiful Briny Sea. "are the best." Portobello Road "is cool as well. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is great in this movie one more time. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and the three children's actors are fine too: Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (a boy in the "non-belief age") and Roy Snart as younger brother Paul. I like the black cat. It is very cool. Looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series "Sabrina the Teenage Witch." I find it cute whenever one of the characters in the movie is turned into a white rabbit. Rabbits are very cute, cute and adorable animals. I just love them! Even more funny is that Professor Emelius Browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he becomes human again, he wags his nose like a rabbit. It's really hilarious, combined with his comic figure and that mustache. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie, but its the end is really bad. The first few minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it gets better. The end, however, is weak. That's my main criticism about this, largely because the lively knights thing is a little too much for me and also because of the feeling of war.
