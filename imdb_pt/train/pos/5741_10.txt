One of my favorite movies I watched in Seattle preview. Tom Hulce was amazing, no words could convey his feelings / thoughts. In fact, I sent Mike Ferrell some money to help the movie to be distributed. It's good. The system says I need more rows, but I do not want to distribute plot material. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and director, a writer I think and Mike Ferrell. They talked for about an hour later. Not really a dry eye in the house. Why is Hollywood still stupid? I do not know. (Actually I know, it's our fault, look what we saw) Well, you get what you pay for the guys. Take this and see with someone special. It's a gem.
