I found this film to be the usual French tapa in America's face. The camera often focuses on fat people, sloppy homes and gritty rural areas. While the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the people of the small town who are presented to the viewer, cinematography explores and lowers them. There were undoubtedly lean people to be seen in Glencoe and tidy and organized homes, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen. <br /> <br /> I just hope that some American filmmakers go to France to reveal their worst elements to the American public. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor to France, that everything is not well there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, thus creating serious social inequalities. But Americans are not eager to expose the French because of their prejudice toward their own countrymen and their envy toward the US, so we are not likely to see movies on the subject.
