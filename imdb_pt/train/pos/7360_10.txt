Wow!! This is a good movie! The acting was not good at all, but if you look a few moments in the movie, go back and watch again, it's great! The man at the beginning of the movie walks with his suitcase against three. WOW! I never expected that. Then he puts the coca in a suitcase and runs away. I bet the smoking guy against the three of them was one of his comrades who sold the drugs later. And the genius quotes: '' Nice tones, I need a pair '' '' your own .. if you think you can take them .. '' .. just brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen in a while. Look at the second guy he knocks down after he hit the first guy's head against the table. What a hit! And in the middle of the movie, a guy in a car shot once, so 3 guys fell, he's very good at looking. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The final was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoots Jason Peters after his distraction moves. Jason Peters falls and rolls again while he's dead! I can not say with more words how great this movie is!
