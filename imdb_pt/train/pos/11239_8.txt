The Hidden Frontier is notable for being the oldest series of Star Trek fans on the Internet. Although production quality is not on par with fan productions like Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier focuses largely on the story, and in that sense does it very well indeed. <br /> <br /> The Hidden Frontier does not have physical sets; instead, the actors are filmed against a green screen and the backgrounds inserted digitally. One of the greatest accomplishments of the Hidden Frontier is the sheer volume of work they have produced. One of the ways this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, rather than in post-production. While this saves a lot of time, it is worth noting that the quality of the resulting footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, although it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Hidden Frontier is well worth it, although you might be better off starting to watch the third season as it is where the producers really start to beat pace .
