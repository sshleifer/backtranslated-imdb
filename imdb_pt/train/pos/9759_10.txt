I believe I received this movie when I was a young buck. I remembered watching it as a kid, but I could never find the movie. I remembered good Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck. But one day, when I left my childhood home, I found her. We gather. I'm 17 years old now. I still watch. All the time, actually. It's one of the funniest and most touching movies I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should do a continuation. Mmm, yes a sequel, in fact. Now I'm even thinking of getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body!
