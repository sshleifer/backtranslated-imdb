This film does a superb job of describing the situation of an ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) sufferer. The subject is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS who found it hard to believe she was just acting. Kenneth Branagh, an excellent actor, lives up to expectations as the eccentric artist who behaves badly and is forced to provide companionship to Helena's character as part of his "community service," an alternative to prison time. Observing the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. You care deeply about both.
