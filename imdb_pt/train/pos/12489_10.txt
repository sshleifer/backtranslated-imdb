First, no one can understand why this movie is rated so poorly. This is not only the first really horrible movie since a long time for me, I'm very tough with a decades of horror experience starting with driving on dark rides (ghost trains) as a child. Second, leading actress Cheri Christian has a face that allows you to expect her to be the lead actress in great pictures of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so tremendously beautiful that I suggest to the directors that all those Cameron Diaz, Eve Mendezes, retire, and as always the names of these ephemeral lamps are. Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. <br /> <br /> However, "Dark remains" is also of considerable metaphysical importance. The idea that photographs show creatures of the intermediate reign between reality and "imagination" that are not visible with their own eyes is not new. But I've never seen in a movie before that these creatures are visible in the photographs only for certain people and only for certain times. This means that the picture is not just an iconic image of reality (whereby reality becomes a sign), but it becomes an alternate form of reality that can change as "real" reality can. Being a signal, the change of the image means that it influences the objects photographed, that is, the signal behaves like an object. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common for objects to change signals. F.ex., if someone creates a bird, your photograph will show him with a beard, not without, as before. But the opposite, the change of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is the first and only then the beard grows in the man. This is, quite simply expressed, the case that happens with the photos taken by the main character in prison in this movie. This is new, and we should be grateful for all that is new in horror movies, which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known, especially since the silent time.
