'An Itch In Time' is one of Bob Clampett's series of home runs for the WB in the early 1940s, including 'Horton Hatches The Egg' and 'Tortoise Wins By A Hare'. Drenched in a manic moment and an exaggerated chaos, it is basically the saga of a flea that is busy clearing the way for a new home, and the dog whose ground is being broken. As Master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he has scratches, the unlucky canine will be forced to endure an upward spiral of torment when the flea appropriates picks and power tools to clean the "earth." Finally, the little monster lights the fuse for a small mountain of explosives that he stacked on the victim's rear! There is a tremendous explosion, and the unfortunate dog covers his eyes as his rear end explodes into a fiery Fourth of July display! This really has to hurt, and the dog takes off, but soon he stops the action and says with a cheerful smile: "You'd better cut it because I think I'm starting to like it!" For years this perverted confession has been censored, but current impressions have restored the clip, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original and diabolical glory. Still cut off, however, is the closing gag in which the cat explodes the brain after he laments, "Now I've seen it all!" This was a common joke on WB, but since then she has been purged of this cartoon and several others, including "Horton."
