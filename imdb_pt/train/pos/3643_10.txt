The end of an era was released here in the United States in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie," a live action movie from Disney that seemed to be the "best for the last !!!!!" It happened here in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by an area code found on a plaque there. It was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: It was so good !!! !! It was a very good sports movie, ala "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. I had also taken spectators all over Texas, from somewhere between the enclave and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). I can tell you why I recognize that ballpark (it was "The Ballpark in Arlington", now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It was cool to see the end of Disney's "Golden Age" here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Disney's Golden Age <br /> <br /> 20s-2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with a mouse. .. and finished with baseball ".
