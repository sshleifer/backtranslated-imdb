10 ITEMS OR LESS was done in two weeks on a tight budget by writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small film filmed in Carson, California, that it seems like the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was lucky to associate veteran actor Morgan Freeman with his Spanish projects Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people with different advantages that can improve the other's life. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - but part of the comedy is that he is portrayed as an actor who has been unemployed for four years, looking for a place for a "filling movie" to get back to the flow of things . . His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is left in the decadent market in Carson, where he finds, among others, a Scarlet, the girl in the argumentative line of 10 Items or Less. Scarlet is not only tired of her static work, but is also annoyed by the womanizer husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy colleague (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pairs after some problems shared and off they go on a 'road trip' which results in each of the characters growing up in the presence and life story of the other. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, just said, but because of the tender bond between Freeman and Peace, it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and change is the message. Worth seeing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are moving, informative, and comic - a pleasure to watch. Grady Harp
