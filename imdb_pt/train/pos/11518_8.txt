You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Witch proved that. This movie supports this. It is no more than a comedy of size and complexity. However, because he has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be hilarious even on a budget that could not afford a low price. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as the bumbling and honest Watson, his lack of light and slowness frustrates Cleese's wit. If you ever come across the movie, watch for one or two laughs.
