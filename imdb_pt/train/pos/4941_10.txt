I believe many people rated the film, NOT because of the lack of quality. But it did not follow Hollywood's standard formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The ending is a little too real for others, but the journey the rich characters and the long list of supporters offer is thought-provoking and very entertaining. Even the cinematography is excellent given the urban environment, the direction is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book, this movie will take you to places the normal Hollywood script expected and not. They took some risks and did some different things. I think it worked well, I am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the film, because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
