The American icon Henry Fonda plays "Elegant" John Howard, an elderly truck driver who had his beloved "Eleanor" equipment recovered after a long hospital stay that forced him to lose his payments. Deciding he would like to do just one more perfect run, he leaves the hospital, steals Eleanor and meets old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to change his troupe of prostitutes. The wonderful performance of Fondas is a natural anchor for a movie that pulls the strings of the heart as effectively as it tickles the funniest bones of the most evil scenes. <br /> <br /> comic books. An excellent cast including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young man, Susan Sarandon (who is also a co-producer), and Dub Taylor (a delicious ham, as always, in the most comical part of the scene) helps immensely. The nature that confirms the life of the image and the pungency of the journey has an incredible weight; this is an image, as long as you enter it, you can remember long after its end. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is vividly shown here; The countryside looks beautiful. Defined for Craig Safans' wonderful soundtrack, it is a remarkable image in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> It loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions) but still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters. Not a bit of the exploration / drive-in schlock image one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), is a gratifying cinematic experience I can recommend unscrupulously . <br /> <br /> 9/10
