A terrorist tries to steal a secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. The soldiers are able to recover the case, but the terrorist goes to a hotel where he tries to hide. They finally arrive where they are hidden and "clean" the hotel and its occupants. Unfortunately they dismiss your body through the cremation, and if you saw Return of the Living Dead, you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 has been widely criticized by critics and fans of zombies, complete mess of a movie. While this is a fair assessment, it is not without its high points. On the one hand, there are many bloody deaths to keep the injured dogs happy. There are plenty of zombies that seem to come out of every possible place. They are in the water, in the beams of the houses, hidden in the trees and for some reason like to hide under a bunch of dead bushes, only to jump to attack as the heroes try to escape. There's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it, since the scene alone makes Zombi 3 need to see the IMO. It may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it's good to sit and watch a movie that requires nothing but your time and an open mind. Zombie 3 fits that account and then some. It's even nicer if you open a few beers and watch them with some friends. I give an 8/10, just because of pure pleasure.
