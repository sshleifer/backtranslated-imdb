Blonde and Blonder have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more of a movie you are being totally irrational. It sounds like a backlog, Carry On, when the show was no longer on fire, but it was even funnier than that, think of Behind or England and you will not be far from the truth. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece they are doing, although you can give me many things that tell me to like it. The support cast is energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a couple of duff spins in a movie that is already pretty much forgotten making a lot of difference to anything, so just smile. I really think Blonde and Blonder are stars and I hope you hate me for it.
