**Notice! Spoilers Ahead! This short is part of one of the two that expose the brief portion of "The Matrix," in which Morpheus explains how the matrix emerged. As we already know the story, the plot itself is not a surprise; and the short is not much fun as informative. But this is how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. The visuals are better than average, and the generally cool colors help the purpose of the short. <br /> <br /> Some problems. The violence of the tale is somewhat gratuitous and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenes), diminishes the direct narrative of the short. Also, it needs to be seen with part two to be complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite some problems, this short one still fulfills its purpose. It would not fit in the original film in style, content or flow. This is the perfect method to reveal the story. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good information. It could have been said a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
