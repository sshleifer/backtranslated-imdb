The autobiography that this film is based on remains one of the most heartbreaking books I have ever read. He tells the surprising stories of two sisters, both of whom gained devotion and respect, working well in their 70s as a teacher and dentist, and then lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly differentiated performance as the "blackest" rebel Bessie, the dentist. It not only expresses your anger, anguish, and wisdom; It lets you know exactly where they came from using word saving. Diahnn Carroll perfectly feels the older sister, the teacher, but I fear she will never make me believe she is over 100 years old. It does not matter - the stories are worth it. Amy Madigan is somewhat extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as a reporter for the NY Times. This is also just a little distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction, and although two or three are slightly impaired in the translation, most of them are very well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as essential reading for all the people I recommend. any books to. I can not much but this TV movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the taste to be worth it by itself.
