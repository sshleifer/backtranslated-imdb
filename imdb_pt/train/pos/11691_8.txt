Great movie when I saw it. I have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. When I got older and saw it again, I realized that the movie is medium. Compared to movies that are good ad comedies, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and any change with the racial material breaks the barriers a little bit which is great. Also the thought of how the movie goes is a good way of thinking. It's like most thought of a movie, but also a little twist that is a very nice touch. I like the movie in general, so I give a ... <br /> <br /> Still a good 7/10 for me.
