My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. Then 10 out of 10 of our family. How much violence? Not really so violent, especially the cover variety. No one really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so it certainly is appropriate for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​comic books where it should. Firstly, beautiful graphics, wonderfully made textures, with true depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. The moss on the stones, the rust on the metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone all contribute to the whole. <br /> <br /> Character modeling, unlike many contemporary computer graphics films, is quirky, not cute, again within an artistic whole. Faces may seem less malleable than in other films, but the characters are more like puppets than humans. I think it's a good thing, it lends truth, how strangely it sounds, it's easier to suspend your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, skin, clothing, at least with the likes of Pixar. . Just notice in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and they all have detailed clothes that made me stop the movie just to admire it. <br /> <br /> The scenery. Far beyond the likes of cars, and even the wall. Space has been made many times, but the fantasy ambiance of Dragon Hunters is only comparable to some scenes from Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but again it's an artistic whole with lots of good ideas thrown effortlessly. Magnificent views like the scene at Monsters Inc. where they mount all the doors through their storage facility, or Wall E where we see the huge garbage towers he made, abound in this movie, everything is grand, but never stopped; it's just the backdrop all the way! The interlude where they walk through the area with fantastic falls. The Chinese wall, the islands floating in the sky. The broccoli in the sky? That's really where I believe CG should go, do something that takes your breath away, and do it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not just epic, and fortunately without any vocals, and purely original to the movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is very good. Casting your inspiration for cartoons, especially some good use of stretching and compression. Sometimes it's not realistic, but 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu, the gentle and uncertain giant, is gradually growing in confidence, warming Zoe's attention. Gwizdo, the astute manager of Lian-Chu, redeems himself at the end, while Zoë is not really changed but whoever this cute child changes anyway? I at least loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters SA. <br /> <br /> The inner conflict in the group is solved by external pressures, just as it should in an appropriate fantasy story. <br /> <br /> The story is mostly reminiscent of the Never Ending story, especially as the world unfolds. Monsters are pretty standard except flocking. It does not have the emotional impact of Wall E, which is the really strong point of this movie, but it's a much more fun ride, and there's the annoying music scene repeating itself in the first, and it has action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has, as I mentioned, a complete vision, which seems to have been followed strictly everywhere. <br /> <br /> It seems, that the setting is ready for more adventures, and I would at least expect it to. <br /> <br /> A side note, the French actor doing Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm glad he's not, even though he's one of my favorites. Good to hear a new one, for me, voice. <br /> <br /> I give the maximum rating, a bit surprised by the mediocre and low ratings of some; I have tried to address some of the concerns raised by two of the lower-vote reviews. Addressing this film as an adventure and as a European film, is not opposed to Hollywood, but different.
