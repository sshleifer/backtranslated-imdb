Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the home of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often unbearably irritating. For example, a central theme in history is the inability of young France to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrait is executed flawlessly, notably in the way Denis frames the story with scenes of France's return to her childhood home, the lack of intimacy of the girl with the other characters in the film makes it difficult for the viewer to invest much interest in her development (or lack thereof) as the protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development hinders engagement in the vaguely organized plot. The film raises a great deal of tension between the characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The last scenes are powerful, but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
