<br /> <br /> Filmed artfully, the actors portray exactly their role. You get the real feel of seeing Lucienne rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl in the world. A sense of tragedy to triumph again in the tragedy. All in all I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And it CAN MUCH to say that Prix De Beute '(The Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) is a LARGEST favorite in my collection of silent films. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty along with a tragic plot.
