This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Jane Calamity, are the central characters. With the end of the Civil War, Lincoln mentions his concern that the dynamism of the country would be enhanced if people followed the advice: "Go west, young man," which, fortunately, the film did not erroneously attribute Horace Greeley, as several others did. But then he is murdered, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich by selling weapons to American Indians. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a boy, while a steamboat is carrying on a dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he finally gives the boy, calling him "Arkansas Toothpick," which was actually a different kind of knife, although both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock finally meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the real man. Cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down. <br /> <br /> When they reach their destination, they encounter Calamity Jane, who has a crush on Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is that your baba?" The line that caused the Hayes Board some problem, since a definition of "mopsy" was prostitute. Demille wanted the line, and one of her aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books on Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of evil virtue". It worked; the line remained inside. The Indians were getting restless, in part because of the superior weaponry they received from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help explore the area so troops could safely reach a besieged area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check on the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who led some of the hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Calamity Jane is captured, and Hickock is captured trying to save her. They are brought to the boss, and although neither of them speaks, the torture applied to Hickock breaks the willpower of Calamity Jane, and she tells the route that Cody is using. <br /> <br /> The two are released, and Hickock joins Cody. and their forces, in part to alert them, are entering a trap. With the help of Hickok, they postpone the Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoners. While they wait for the authorities, Hickock is shot by back-shots while playing cards. <br /> <br /> There are numerous historical anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of the legend. Very good for the 1930s.
