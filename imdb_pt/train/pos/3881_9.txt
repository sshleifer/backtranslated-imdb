This movie caught me with the incredible opening sequence that led me to a complete reversal of perspective, so I became addicted the moment the title appeared. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a complicated way, like Identity or the usual suspects, but the way we all try to do whatever banal life, we find ourselves a little more interesting . The scenes in the chicken depots are spectacular. At one point, Jorgen (owner of the chicken farm) attends a seminar in laughter, where he is the worst student. Your discomfort with it allows you to see the depth of your desire to change yourself. The movie made me think about the hidden mysteries behind the surface of the most ordinary people I see every day. There is not much plot here. Guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy, but the fascination is in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they find out. This movie appealed to me in the same way as the Sideways, although the characters could not be more different.
