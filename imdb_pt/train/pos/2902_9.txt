I sit in movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about movies for hours. The admiration that this film has caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation, because I am watching the scenes of the film and search within my thoughts for ideas of cinema and innovative dialogs that can emerge of something greater than the mind of Damian Szifron. <br /> Looking at the environment, so uncompromising, so simple, I'm thinking; this man is a genius. It is no wonder that he created what is probably the best television show Argentina has ever seen, and then a first movie full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet achieved. "El fondo del mar" is the name and, awakened (some years ago), my enthusiasm for our daily cinema. <br /> <br /> Starting his journey of people's daily lives, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero could never in "El Bonaerense"; the life of the Federal Police Department. Trapero's film was a journey in the mind and experiences of a man, not in the places he saw. Yes, there was detailed training and many crime situations, but Szifron in "in there" is more of a detective story, like the ones we know and love, with mysteries and electrifying music. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of humanity in his writings, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Diaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many high caliber actors in the film, but these two actors are those that the film can not do without. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who has just discovered that his wife betrays him; and have to work on a case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist who receives the detective's treatment. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but the sheriff takes advantage of the disposition of time and suggests that he join Diaz in his routines: "It's nothing, the usual stuff, no problem." But it is bigger than that, and will reveal a part of the doctor's personality that he did not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship developed between the two leaders can not be explained unless it is observed, because it embodies such complexity that demonstrates how talented some men like Szifron are today who are trying to leave a signature in our history. Reaching for points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high-pressure situation, Diaz tells Silverstein, "How do we continue our treatment?", And Silverstein replies, "No, I'm not your doctor, you call me to dinner, I'm your friend" We laugh because we can not help it. <br /> <br /> And we can not help laughing when Diaz hits a car on the street and does not care about him, or when he overtakes all the red lights on the street, or when he smokes marijuana on his police patrol and Silverstein can not believe (but also smokes because he's screwed); or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with Diaz's thieving friends. Diego Peretti's magic is what we get there. He, a psychiatrist, makes a presentation on the "Love Loves" plan, but impresses with all his reach. Luis Luque, on the other hand, is back on the rails with a high-level portrait that reminds us of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> There's a passion I have for it, and like I said, I could write about it for hours, but unfortunately that's not how it works and I have to be precise and sum up. Although I have to watch many of the old movies and study them, I could guarantee that "Tiempo de valientes" is the comedy that Argentina was waiting for and never got? So far.
