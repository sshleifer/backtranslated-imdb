VIVAH is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! PERIOD !! In my book is one of the best 100 films ever made in Bollywood. It's sad that this movie does not have much criticism and does not have so much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a true achievement of a director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar, Kiya Sooraj once again achieved a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and fluffiest movie I've ever seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP and later DHOOM 2, who even knocked Don on that subject, I finally see a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture that we have and we are making Hollywood style filthy remake movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and closely related to the Indian system of arranged marriage, which I would also like to be a part of. Our system that teaches us to obey the elders, follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie! Of course there is no force in choosing your life partner and should be a brief encounter between the couple and the two to decide how brilliantly shown in this film is. <br /> <br /> Coming back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a Journey story between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage. The stage where the guy knows the girl! .... They both understand each other. They both try to assess whether they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the several that occur during weddings. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are brilliant. ! I particularly like the HAMARI SHAADI CHAAR OF HAFTE REH GYE and Anjaane Ajnabi ...... General A must see for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition and I certainly do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS!
