I loved all of Cream's work, even though there is such a small and precious catalog of work. Even when they go for up to twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are great examples), they are still recovering from more than half of any rock currently in operation. This gel power on stage is given one of the most anticipated meetings of rock bands of all time with their shows at the Royal Albert Hall last year. They may have gotten older as well as their fans, but the energy is still there, with the great arrangements of the classic blues songs, as well as theirs. The interpretations of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, do not seem to miss a beat. Clapton's solos have a background that he sometimes does not have when he's on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, enough said. Jack Bruce is robust enough with his vocals yet with a kind of power that Clapton could never have on his own. Bottom line, if you want to see what were the best shows you'd like to have seen last year (well, some may have seen them), it's all about this DVD with special cool features.
