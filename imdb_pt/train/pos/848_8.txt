The turning point in "The Matador" happens in the middle of the movie, when Danny, an unsophisticated man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his Mexico City hotel, enjoying a moment of tranquility. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing that it is Julian, the killer paid, he refuses to respond. But does he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, director of "The Matador," introduces us to a character, Julian Noble, who does not show qualities that can be changed. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real bar in Mexico City, he talks and tells his new acquaintance what he really does to live. <br /> <br /> Danny who came to sell his program to a Mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local team that seems to be up front to get the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls victim to the charisma and charm of the clever Julian. It is not until some time later, on a cold winter night, that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to return a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this point that the secret that unites them is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against the type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble. Just to watch him walk through the lobby of the hotel in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this strange couple. Hope Davis appears in only a few scenes leaving us wailing why she did not stay any longer. Philip Baker Hall makes an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard runs the work with his own material with style. The musical track is by Rolfe Kent and the cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything.
