A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a block of doodles. A great cast mingling with an intriguing plot supervised by a Twin Peaks influence on director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrait of a man in a ligament looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, just like Dennis Hopper. It's a shame he never had a bigger profile in business. I'm sure he has followers, though. In short, this is a great movie that shows you do not need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be a fun movie.
