This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. Political reflections point to them: we see scarcity after the war, how the traders were able to control much of the day-to-day (delicious moment when Fassbinder, who plays a grifter, tries to sell a full set of Kleist to Schygulla, which notes that burning books do not provide much heat: she really wants firewood). <br /> <br /> There is some clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, should be faster. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls when she insults the GI - I cringed, it was so bad. But as the story unfolds and the years go by, I've been drawn more and more to this cold, lustrous world.
