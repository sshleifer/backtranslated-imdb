If you loved Long Way Round, you'll enjoy it so much. It's educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent videographers and a lot of Russ. Ewan makes some appearances, but Charley really does it himself. He's funny, engaging, and still a pool of stress and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> <br /> The series ends in 7 episodes. Like the LWR, the preparation is almost as exciting as the race. Although they cover the intricacies of the race well, there could be a bit more explanation on the trucks and cars, which are just mentioned and rarely seen in races. It's a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series features stunning photographs as well as a few interviews from mouths of people. Yikes There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR, but this is not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US, you know when it will be released, so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer like I did. Oh, and be prepared to buy another bike.
