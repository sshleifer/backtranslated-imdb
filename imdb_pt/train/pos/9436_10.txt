"Is it up to you, Ed?" "Now you start playing the game." The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this movie with his new girlfriend, the opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I was not sure what I was seeing, but I never forgot, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. Watching it today, thirty-six years later, still gives me shivers. <br /> <br /> My dad was a big fan of Burt Reynolds, which is why he was in line for almost an hour to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie'. I had seen two films in the Dome before this: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". Well, that was not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was in shock. <br /> <br /> But even at that tender age, I enjoyed the art ... and after seeing it again today, I'm surprised that I was still standing up after witnessing this highly disturbing but extremely well-crafted film. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year old adolescent who had not yet kissed her first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for taking me, but it was a little too much for a child to witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find this quite disturbing, but I'm still very impressed with the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds as an absolute marvel, as well as all the basics ... of Billy Redden as the wonder of the innate guitar, Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman ... everyone does a job admirable. The sound quality is unparalleled, from the chirping of the birds to the clocks. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first-rate. <br /> <br /> The moral issues raised, from the murder of sex killers to the result of killing a human being, remain as deep today as it did when this groundbreaking film was released. And the classic sequences of trying to survive in the desert after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life changers. These four men, city men, suddenly faced with a situation never imagined, elevate the pattern of action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic to be sure. And the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" was quoted incessantly, from Saturday Night Live to makeshift commentary around the water cooler at work, this movie is undoubtedly a large part of our corporate pop culture ... As far as "Make my day" or "I'll be back" have gone. <br /> <br /> So, what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted by men from the mountain, away from your life? in the city, cozy bed, wife and children? And if you took the steps Burt Reynolds made (and I would have done the same) would you bury your body under the lake, or would you be tried and risked? The bottom line is: Delivery Deliveries. You can take this to the bank. If this movie does not get under your skin then you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is still the same: Ed can not kill the deer ... then he changes. Life and unpredictable circumstances can change a man. And I suppose that's what this movie is about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his acting elevates the film to another level. Climbing the stones at dusk, terrified and determined to do the right things. You must see it to believe it. I guarantee your heart rate will be raised to a new level. With quick, tense, tense, well-drawn steps like a banjo string, this is a moral piece that asks questions that remain to this day. Times change, but our choices as human beings have not changed. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
