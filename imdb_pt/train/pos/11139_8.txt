Hardly dreams come true for this brass ring pursuit by a naive crook (JON VOIGT) and his co-mano partner (DUSTIN Hoffman), who will soon forge a friendship based on basic survival skills. <br /> <A daring film for its time, and a prime example of the type of sandy landscape being explored in the most graphic films of the 60s. It symbolizes the "end of innocence" in American films, since it was the only pornographic film to win an Oscar for Best Picture. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male who arrives in the big city hoping to find women an easy way to make money when they fight for his body but soon finds the city is a cool place with no welcome carpet for Yours. Supported by a sly lame (DUSTIN Hoffman), he undergoes a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the boundaries of a cold water for the promised sun in Florida, a land his friend "Ratzo "dreams of living. <br /> <br /> But even in this final quest, the two are losers. John Schlesinger delicately directed a brilliant screenplay of Waldo Salt, and John Barry's haunting theme "Midnight Cowboy" adds to the poignant moments of search and despair. <br /> <br /> In short: A true American classic honestly facing a difficult and daring subject to show the point of view of certain aspects of city life.
