It's a shame that Deliverance is mainly known as the Rapeback movie and for Dueling Banjos. Even the people who saw the movie can not get their mind off that rape scene. Not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. Certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. People tend to miss the power of the movie that contains the infamous buggy scene. <br /> <br /> Deliverance's acting, plot, cinematography, and soundtrack help her charisma. The backcountry was filmed is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject. The larger and smaller actors make you feel like you're coming down the river with them. <br /> <br /> What sets this film apart from others is the tangible sense of fear it inspires. Not many movies can make you feel so scared. In short: This movie is a classic. I can not say much more than that.
