Guy Kibbee gives a lot of laughter to the viewer. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very poorly rated actor, is superb at giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, it teaches you to say something that means nothing to the voting public. A campaign based on no comment, "I take this under guidance," and "Maybe yes, but again, maybe not," is the almost perfect way to win an election. Briefly, the more candidate, the greater the chance of winning. After all, the public can identify with that person. With regard to the film, this makes a lot of comedy.
