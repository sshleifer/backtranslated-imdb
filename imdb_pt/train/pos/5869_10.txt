after having watched The Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, the Jacknife movie had great shoes to fill. It has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie, as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here, as well as Kathy Baker. But this film belongs to Ed Harris, who performs a powerful, emotional and shocking performance. The film is based on a play, and there are one or two scenes. where this seemed obvious to me. Why I just want to say that for those one or two scenes it seemed like I was watching a play. That was not a big deal, and it really does not shrink the movie. I really really liked it This movie is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They have similar epochs and have similar themes, but they are two very different films. I thought The Deer Hunter was great, and I also think that this movie was great. in this one that makes it so great. for me, Jacknife is a 10/10
