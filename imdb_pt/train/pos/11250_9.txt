Having just seen the miniseries A Perfect Spy in one go, you can not do anything but take off your hat - a pure masterpiece, compared to other Le Carré minis on Smiley, has very different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the minis about Smiley, it's Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, you might say. <br /> <br /> Here is ensemble and story that is important, as the lead actor, played excellently by Peter Egan in the final episodes, is nothing charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan plays a guy named Magnus Pym, who by lying, being dishonest and telling people what they like to hear, is much appreciated by all, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech manipulator. <br /> <br /> Never again the machinery behind a spy, and / or traitor, was said better! After having followed his life from a very young age, we fully understand what makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and pretend everything is what makes him a "perfect spy", as his Czech coach calls him. <br /> <br /> And following your life, we understand perfectly how hard it is to go back to the straight and narrow path, once you have strayed from it. He goes on, even if he never achieves anything economical, except the promotion of his MI5 espionage masters. Everyone is happy, as long as the fake information flow continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a not-so-good man who always dreams of schemes to fool people with money. In recent years, it is your child who has to save you, again and again. But for the example given by his father and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mother is sent to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way to survive, not telling the truth. At first he exaggerates a little, but quickly learns to tell the right lies, and to be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that he tells those who want to hear about him and his father. His Czech handler Alex, skillfully played by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existent informants, which provides false information to the British MI5 for years and years, just as the English did with the German spies who were active in the UK before and during the war - they continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been transformed, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> Young boys who play Magnus in the younger years do this wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, more cynical and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you buy the difference with ease, for it is always how we change over a lifetime, from enthusiasm to sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> It was really worth it!
