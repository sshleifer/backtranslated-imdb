If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to a loving hobo and you have your belly laughing at pathos, watch something else. If, however, you love slapstick comedy as one of the best, watch this one. <br /> <br /> The image is of the bum who really can not get the girl. He sees another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has fun spoiling the fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "park comedies," filmed in Mack Sennett Park, with pickpockets, police officers, and couples. These shorts work, since the format allows Chaplin to shine while he goes through difficulties. <br /> <br /> I checked the box, as this could be considered a spoiler, although not if you saw those movies. Everyone ends up in the pond, except for Chaplin. He gets the girl, who in this case was played by Minta Durfee, Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
