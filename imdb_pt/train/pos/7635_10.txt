I have seen this movie many times and I have to tell you, I have enjoyed every moment. This is the pinnacle movie of Belushi in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so friendly and identifiable with the common man that you can not help but get involved when you start watching. The film has a wonderful cast of stars, some were already large and others were just beginning. It's considered a good movie, and it's exactly what it is. This movie teaches that life is not always that bad. Sometimes you just need to look at things from a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you are finished watching, you will enjoy things that have a lot more and you will also be smiling. You can not ask for much more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention that it is a hilarious movie and you will never lose interest. Very much underestimated movie here folks. <br /> <br /> Rate me: 10 I'm out !!!
