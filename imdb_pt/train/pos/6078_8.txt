I was especially happy that Othello himself was dark-skinned in this film, and Desdemona did not have blond hair as he often did. The cast also played very well, and I enjoyed the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say that some scenes were interpreted very erotically for a character like Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and that is why it is not appropriate to show her in bed with Cassio - although this was only happening in Othello's imagination. At first I was a bit surprised, even though a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying at the death scene.
