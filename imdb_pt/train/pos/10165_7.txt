In fact, my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, there are those funny parts that make it worth seeing, do not get me wrong, it's not the funniest movie in the world, nor is it original because it's an idea we've seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a movie for boyfriends ... I do not think exactly, but who cares? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, this is a very funny movie, see the two if you want and I know you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his film. I would like the male character protagonist to be given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the movie is good.
