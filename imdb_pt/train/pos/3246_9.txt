I saw this movie for the first time out about 5 years ago and I could not help laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the plot, the characters, the scenery. As for the movies, I would not call it a great movie, but for what it's supposed to be, it's fantastic. Gets its meaning. The cast is perhaps as good as any already assembled in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who have not yet seen, I'll give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank robbery. However, when his friend is arrested by two police officers who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is really a great comedy of bank nickname and is a kind of mansion version of Oceans Eleven, with only four criminals who do not support each other, and in Montana instead of Las Vegas. All in all, if you like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie.
