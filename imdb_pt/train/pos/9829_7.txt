This movie is incredible on so many levels ... and none of them is the level that was meant to be awesome. <br /> <br /> Just remember this: When you're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... whether they're good or bad ... This is the formula they're using. That's what makes zombie movies so good. <br /> <br /> And what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does not go on. There is never a point where you think to yourself "come on, let's go" ... it moves quickly and curves well. This is the small number of zombie movies. So horrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a great deal of time on your cheek ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> As a big note: if you are watching on DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects during the menu screen, below the soundtrack ... Well ... this is because the song was taken directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only working copy of the song that still exists, which is enough time to loop.
