Once again proving his incredible versatility, John Turturro plays the introspective genius of Russian chess preparing for a return tournament, and forging an unlikely relationship with a classmate (Emily Watson) in an Italian hotel of the 1920s. They fall in love, to the horror of their social climber mother (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story, whose chess glow can make you look brainy. But despite its origins in a Nabakov story, it certainly is not. The romantic elements and the notion of time and place outweighed the psychological analysis. John Turturro, having appeared in "Barton Fink", "O brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he does not depend on the Coen Bros films to assert his stature.
