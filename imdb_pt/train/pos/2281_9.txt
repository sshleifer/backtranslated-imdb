There are countless films related to World War II, but Mother Night is quite distinct among them: In this film, we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, a CIA agent, Major Wirtanen (Goodman), recruits Campbell, who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the upper echelons of Hitler's regime. However, the agreement is that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and so Campbell becomes a hated figure across the US. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can not do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply touching as we watch the Campbell tragedy that, though a great patriot, is treated with disdain by all who surround him. Not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the people closest to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's desperation increasing and almost suffocating the viewer. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the part of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in "Affliction", although in both roles he interprets tragic figures that are meant for self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the overall cast. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book, so I can not judge how the movie compares to it. Anyway, it does not matter here: my review is in the film itself, and the movie deserves a 9/10.
