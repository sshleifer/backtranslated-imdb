John Travolta, the world's greatest honkeytonk, and a mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for! Yes, you probably will not have many surprises or deep meaning in this. However, I've always found it quite enjoyable to watch this hickory romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you can expect from a hardcore couple. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bull riding and, of course, the necessary fights. He has a good soundtrack from 1980, with "Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places," "The Devil went to Georgia," and "Hello Texas," from my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break your cowboy boots and have a boogie of boots! <br /> <br /> *** (Out of 4)
