* SPOILERS * This is only the second pay-per-view I gave a perfect 10, being the first the Royal Rumble of 1991. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, just fun disposable . And that's why I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase as well as Ludvig Borga against Marty Jannetty were the only low points. They were games OK, but DiBiase deserved better in its final pay per view match. Nowadays, such a game would have disagreements and a greater climax for Razor's first big push. And Jannetty, just out of a race for the Intercontinental title, could have had a better combination with Borga. But I do not think anyone really cares. They just needed a Borga push on the pay per view television. <br /> <br /> The IRS and The Kid were great, as were Michaels and Perfect. I wish that Perfect could have won, but Michaels lies down for no one. Notice how soon after that, he left the WWF not to have to work for Razor. Bret Hart had two big fights with Doink (note how the best game of all is against Hit-man) and then Lawler. His rivalry was a classic; that's why this year's Feud of the Year was obvious. How often do you see two legends winning Feud of the Year so late in their careers? <br /> <br /> The fight between the Steiners-Heavenly Bodies was one of the best of the year. Who knew the Bodies could defend themselves against one of the best teams of all time? <br /> <br /> Many say Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF (as in, pre-WWE) great was the mix of athleticism and freak show. Is there a soul out there who did not like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, though not even close to the status of the year. They put Lex Luger well, but they made a wise choice in having Yokozuna holding the belt. He was the first heel since Superstar Graham to hold the belt for over two months. Nowadays, jumps are champions all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF to the WWF of the 90s, if you blinked, you lost a jump title. <br /> <br /> As a fan of old school wrestling, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
