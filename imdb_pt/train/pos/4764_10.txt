There are some comments about this movie that say he is a bad and silly and an excellent actor like Pierre Fresnay should not have agreed to act on it. <br /> <br /> I think, just the opposite, that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so formidable that it turns the film into something excellent. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very controversial scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe a priest? even a defrocked ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps bizarre. But for someone who was raised in a Catholic structure, it is very emotional, even if quite unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The death scene of the younger priest is tremendously shocking. But it is very well represented. Pierre Fresnay transforms the mad act of murder into something understandable within the temporal madness of his character, the tortured Morand who, in this terrible way, returns to his duty.
