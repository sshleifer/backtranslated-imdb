I could not believe the low 5.6 rating on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously at the time I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote that part of memorable comedy as much as I can. Seriously, to get such a low rating, people who voted should have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very shallow open mind. If you do not like humorous movies, do not watch them! Combining absurd humor, a very good narrative and an excellent rhythm given by the various gags, this movie came into my DVD collection. And not to mention the visual farces embedded here and there and of course the use of "clin d'oils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite films of organized crime. <br /> <br /> I've shown this movie to many people and being introduced to it with no specific expectation (except watching a comedy) - the state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion - everyone enjoyed it very much. It goes well, it does not take long to watch and there is absolutely no slowing in the evolution of the story, which I think is really simple. Of course not perfect, some jokes are a little short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other opinions of yours. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This movie is in my opinion a precursor as "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well thought out comedies. Which nowadays are increasingly absurd, while reducing the side of thought and naivety. Sometimes jokes need more culture than most people imagine to be understood correctly, if at all. As a final word, I would like to say: Watch yourself, do not follow Joe's average saying and if you do not like it then you will know for real that it was not good for your taste, which is understandable but unlikely in the my opinion.
