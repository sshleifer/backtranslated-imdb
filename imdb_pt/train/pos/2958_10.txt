A comedy of epic and funny proportions of the guys who brought you South Park, and most of the faces of Orgazmo. This vulgur obscence movie has totally disgusting, eggotistical and satirical content. It portrays the incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals. I LOVE IT!!!!! That's a funny thing. Really funny. Two loser friends create a game at the entrance of the house, which explodes into a national feel. Corruption, greed, and blackmail make the sport sour, and Coop solves it. And along the way, you will laugh. Very. That's all there is. Appreciate!!!!
