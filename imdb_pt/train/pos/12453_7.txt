Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate low budget with not good. Anything else this movie might need, more budget really is not part of it. Big sets and many special effects would have made it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty, and this is crucial for this movie to work. Your wise smiles and looks are formidable, and you find yourself wishing the camera does not leave your face. This makes it viable that villain Nikolai, played by a notorious (at least in the US) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau may have an unusual brain interest in it, something that Modesty can exploit. She is able to divert her rape with just a jerk and spitting "stop wasting my time!" then attacking among his heavily armed, but suddenly confused, henchmen. To make a scene like this plausible does not happen by chance. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with Staden playing Modesty is that it's not very easy for her to go hand in hand. with an athletic and muscular face like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She's not a Peta Wilson or an actress of the Hilary Swank type who can give a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau letting himself be dominated by Staden seems like he's just fighting with his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not really an action movie, this is not a big flaw. I just hope they do it better if and when they do sequences.
