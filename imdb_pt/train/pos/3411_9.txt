This is easily a 9. Michel Serrault, best known for his comedic roles in the early part of his career as an actor, does an impressive, even disturbingly striking, work of imitating Dr. Petiot, a legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> He is so believable at any and all times in the movie, that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the best of all times gets this done, and when they do it is only in a handful of parts, at best. The whole story (a true story that happened in 20th century France) is so powerful, so sinister - that it makes a very strong film that it remembers for a long, long time.
