This is a very entertaining movie that follows the rehearsal process of a Macbeth NY production. Although there is much to be said about power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's themes) in our modern world, the film works best when you are not taking yourself too seriously. Actors recognized as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do good work in the lead roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where Banquo's "murder" (John Elsen) is rehearsed. Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in the theater, but those who like Shakespeare must like this movie.
