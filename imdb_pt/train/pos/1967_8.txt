I do not understand why the reviews in this movie are so universally bad, unless I'm just out of it. I found it sick, shiny, distorted, and psychologically sophisticated. You will not delve into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this one. It has layers inside layers, nuances acting by Stone, and a plot that will keep you guessing, even after you've finished. People need to overcome the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and that Michael Douglas is not in it. I predict that this movie will be a huge success on DVD, once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the professional critics who launched it. Give it a shot, you can be glad you did!
