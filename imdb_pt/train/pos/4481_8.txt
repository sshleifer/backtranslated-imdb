The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is horrible and 2) the love interest of Kelly's character leaves much to be desired, (IMHO). Make love to Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, it 's the little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most fun and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my favorites and my kids. I'm 28 and she's 4, so although the character is less iconic than Mickey, he's still a favorite with many children and adults nowadays. Kelly is always captivating, her eyes full of fun and excitement. In all the movies I've seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paula Abdul "tried" Kelly's moves. I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the twentieth century. If you were to watch only one part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
