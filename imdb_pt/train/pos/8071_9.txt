This film deals with the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and, more specifically, of a man's life, after he informs a friend the reward for the head and the subsequent consequences. Watching the movie, I had the feeling that you could pick up the script and with just a few minor updates, do it again and unfortunately still fit into contemporary events. But the remake would not be so good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he deservedly won an Oscar) and a great cast that includes most, if not all of the actors with brogues in Hollywood at the time, most of them character actors recognized or established at the time or just beginning . A very good movie worth watching. Highly recommended.
