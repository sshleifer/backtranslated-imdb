While traveling by train in Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States and Celine returns to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite novels, actually one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It's a low budget movie with a very simple and real plot, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogues are impressive. The direction is incredible, conveying the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just completed my review number 1,000 on IMDb, and I chose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number, because it's a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar, with such a script, direction and performances. Yesterday I probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Before Dawn"
