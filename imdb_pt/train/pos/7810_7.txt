What is "Cry Freedom" like? It is simply a great and unique experience about the making of South Africa and how blacks in that country were repressed by whites. The main character in the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he talks critically about the visions of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Biko and he changes his view on him and also begins to understand what the authorities are doing with the blacks in South Africa (from the top, even the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides he has to write a book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it. But Woods must escape from his country to publish this book and he must also put his family second, so that the world can discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with main message that black and white are the same, because we are all people. The story takes us to South Africa and this (film) is a great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and I am disappointed that only 3200 people have rated this movie. This is a movie from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story could not be presented in a shorter way, because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to publish this book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> There was also a great relationship between Woods and Biko, as well as the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Biko's death) before the truth can be revealed (Woods' book).
