A good image is worth every word. This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed about people with Down syndrome. And I will not ruin it by telling you. You will want to see yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an incredible actor. I did not need to understand a single word he said to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie has its own magic. After watching it, I understood better that we attached great value to the achievements and not enough for the people we love. Passion and simplicity is all we need.
