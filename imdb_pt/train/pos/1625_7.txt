A surprisingly good movie! Got some good jokes through the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are. We understand, you stupid blondes, keep this up! <br /> <br /> The evil plot dodges from being called "tacky". And breasts are always one thing more than the film, for some strange reason, does not play much with this letter, even though the plot introduces two black women who act as the perverse part of our two blondes. <br /> /> So, after all, a good movie to watch. I almost got an 8/10, but we're not going to be crazy.
