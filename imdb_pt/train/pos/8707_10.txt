"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I have ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as "the bearer of the sword". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that appears under the skin in his hand. On the first side, he may seem more of a foolish superhero of the senseless movie about unrealistic events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly be called an anti-hero. I think he is just a person who has lost the meaning of his life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life he never knew anyone who could understand him and love him (except his mother). His whole step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everyone for his gift that has become a condemnation for him. And suddenly he knows her. She does not need idle conversations and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She does not care what he did. The fact that he is beside her is more important than anything else. But soon she discovers her secret: he kills two people (his ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before his eyes. Even after that, she could not escape her feelings. They try to run, but it's hard to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. He is caged; She is in a psychiatric hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she believes he will save her. He overcomes many obstacles, but finally finds it. They run again, but they are not invulnerable. She is injured, she needs a break, but the police almost get them. He does not know what to do, they drive to a corner, and then his sword begins to chop down trees, chopper around them, but there is no need of it, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in all the world again.
