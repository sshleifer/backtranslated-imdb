It made me think about it for days after seeing it. This to me is the mark of a great movie. The tightly closed eyes had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people demanding these happy endings of Hollywood cookie cutters. I'm planning to go see him again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but regardless of that, the emotional messages from the movie were totally felt.
