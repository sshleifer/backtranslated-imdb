Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only familiar thing in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to the international audience: Canadian History and First Nations Culture. "Gray Owl" is a light examination of how a man came to be adopted in the Ojibway of Northern Ontario, learning and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. This torture, however, is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact it can cause. <br /> <br /> However, it is a film that keeps its audience without any violence. It pays deep respect to Canada's First Nations and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotyped manner. Brosnan's performance is a bit harsh, but I suspect it's exactly how Lord Attenborough wanted him to be. Thank you for a proud Canadian.
