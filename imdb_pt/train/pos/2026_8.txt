I saw this mini-series for the first time a few years ago on British television and I was immediately captivated by the story. This surprised me greatly, since I'm not a big fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I consider the heroine of the former as a pharisee, and the latter work as an exaggerated claptrap. <br /> <br /> "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", like the works mentioned above, is also a bit depressing. in parts. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, the incredibly savage and beautiful scenery of Yorkshire and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This movie successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle. of all the women of the time. At best, they suffered from a form of small domestic tyranny, as portrayed by the treatment of women in the Markham family. At the other end of the scale is the unfortunate Helen, who is married to a rich man of high incomes, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation, alternating with long periods of neglect. She flees and experiences a brief moment of freedom, but, as a mysterious woman living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the object of gossip and rancorous speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suppressive Helen Markham. Not only unbelievably beautiful (despite terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most incredible cheekbones, she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film. Tara is dignified and indifferent while at the same time letting us see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves It's the depraved but curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing it, I could never imagine another actor playing that role. Pam Ferris deserves a special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as well as the actress who played her sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is the non-charitable vicar with a taste for good things in life. Finally, I was able to watch this movie just for Toby Stephens; he is so handsome, robust, sexy, sensitive (but not in a sentimental way). I'm not even sure if he's a good actor, because my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the movie, it is the use of flashbacks that I felt that interfered with the movie. flow of history and made it a bit confusing. Other people who watched this movie with me also had a problem with that, and I discovered that I had to explain to them that certain scenes were, in fact, retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am extremely thankful for the people responsible. to make this movie. Not only did I prepare the video (a rare occurrence), but it also led me to buy Anne Bronte's excellent novel. Of course, this was better than the film, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend that everyone interested watch the movie and read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
