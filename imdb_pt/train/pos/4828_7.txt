Rupert Friend makes a performance, such as Prince Albert, which takes "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is superb. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a deep and deep depression after the death of Prince Albert, and, looking into the eyes of Ruper Friend, I understood. The film does not lead to death, but to an incident that may well have cost him his life. An act of love. I believed, or should I say, him. I believed that what he felt was real. Nothing or no one comes close to the delicacy and depth of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I did not believe for one minute that she was Victoria. No real sense of period. It may not have been her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
