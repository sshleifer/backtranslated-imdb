Yes it is. In fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. Anyway, I'm not usually into the plans, but I think the plots work best in anime and RPG games, (Final Fantasy 7, for example) and not in movies. But this one has it all. Vivid designs of planets, stars, an extremely well written script. While this is not really for kids, they can still watch it, it contains no graphic blood, courage and silicone. But I do not think they'll understand that.
