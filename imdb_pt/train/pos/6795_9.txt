One of the most intelligent serial killers in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers a creative insight into the history and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. Filmmakers create an unexpectedly good view of the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers the Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to find out more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, the Zodiac was not insane at all, but very methodical and self-promoting. The director here reproduces the spectator's expectations and withdraws them. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a "cold case" thriller. It's a clever investigative / procedural horror film that will draw the attention of lice hunters in search of cheap emotions. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like any movie recorded on video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It is an attitude and vision of films that poses technical issues above the entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are coming out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low budget movie, no doubt, but the most demanding viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully constructed preciousness.
