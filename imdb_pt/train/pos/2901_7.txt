Brave Time fits perfectly into the genre of action movies of friends, but transcends his roots thanks to the excellent cast, excellent relationship between his leaders and excellent photography. Diego Peretti stars as Dr. Silverstein, a psychiatrist assigned to mount the shotgun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who was assigned to investigate the murder of two smaller hoods that appear to have been involved in a conspiracy to smuggle weapons. Diaz has been suspended from service but he is the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help to be reinstated. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves involved in a conspiracy involving Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive investigative abilities. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of the team of protagonists Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not classically handsome as Hill. Surprisingly, even for almost two hours, Tiempo de Valientes does not calm down and, in fact, screenwriter and director Damian Szifron prepares a potential sequence in the film's charming coda. All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither favors the smallest common denominator nor insults its intelligence.
