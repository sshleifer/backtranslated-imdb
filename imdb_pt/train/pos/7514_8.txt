She is not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful players in the NBA whose career light has been diminished by no other good reason than the moment of their birth. Their names may stumble so easily on the lips of the public as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets a bit low for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other big players who have always lost the headlines for Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw it written that Gretchen Mol's career was inflamed. following the cover article in the 1998 edition of Vanity Fair, which provided inevitable stardom for Ms. Mol. It was later said that she had been more sensational. I disagree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that for some time after I saw "The Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98, I was confused about which actress would play Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> I had seen "The Thirteenth Floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I had practically straightened them, but I still put them in the same drawer of mental files. Both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on. <br /> <br /> Theron, however, received more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was absolutely intimidating. <br /> <br /> In 2003, "Monster" was released and from that point until the delivery of the Oscar himself, all the movies knew who was the "Best Actress" award was going to. And deservedly yes! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos would be to somehow replicate the digital video stuck in Selby's head. And for a great talent to become physically unattractive! Unprecedented! <br /> <br /> In 2005, "The Notorious Bettie Page" was released. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was in Mrs. Theron's shadow. It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration of the defeated presidential candidate, no one came and no one cared. It was seen as a continuation of an old tale, since the promising actress with a declining career plays a bare part in a "B" movie. Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! No matter what you think about the movie (and I enjoy movies about the fifties) if you pass this movie, you will be missing out on one of the best performances of that year. Mrs. Moll was as Bettie as Mrs. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately, Aileen, for the movie goers, is the nicest character. Whatever the reason, an amoral, sociopathic murderer is less embarrassing to us than a naive, unsophisticated, uninhibited religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life fully confident and fully exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her pictures and movies were never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented as a near-caricature of all perverted things. There was no sense of realism, just parody. Moll captured the essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for several photographers in the film, her body was Bettie's. His total frontal absence from any inhibition fits exactly to everything that was published about Bettie. Kinematic nudity usually portrays eroticism or sexuality. In this movie it's all about innocence. Seeing Gretchen / Bettie naked did not make me want to jump at her, but instilled the desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you spend in this movie, you will be missing one of the best performances of the last few years. By the way, shame the MPAA to give a rating of R.
