I've seen the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but there's something very sweet about Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this movie. Jean Arthur shines when he looks at Powell. There is an unmistakable underground current between them. This movie may not have the wit of the Thin Man series, but it undeniably pays off in charm. As I watched, I thought for sure that Powell was having an off-screen case with Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is a movie where I wish I could go back in time (to schmooze and lock my lips with Powell!) It seems like there's no end to your kindly playful smiles! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." Okay, this is ringing a lot, but I can not help myself.
