I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really funny moments, and makes a very good trailer and many people came up with the expectations of the trailer and this time the movie does not live up to the trailer. It's a bit slower and drags a bit slowly to such an exciting premise, and I think I'm seeing in the comments that people have a love / hate relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not for what could have considered the talent of the cast, I think it is still very good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she is so dizzy and carefree that she stands between everyone else's compliance, she just shines and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, the work filled with testosterone from Lee, his elegant mother-in-law, his brother friend Jim and his fiancee do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boredom that make Stiles. are highlighted first. <br /> <br /> Lee does not live up to his colleagues, I do not think so, but you can see it as something more difficult to live. Maybe this is a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite a bit of slowness and some jokes that do not come out as funny as the writer's intentions, is still very funny and I found a little clever film. The themes of compliance and "following the safe path" seemed to align intelligently in multiple layers. For example, there was every reason why he imagined scenarios, but would never act on them until the last scene, or how he was listening to a radio program on the road talking about how everyone is conforming, or just how everything is selma and julia stiles 'characters said and did was echoed by a person's subjects being the safe choice and being one of them the risky choice. The other good thing about the movie was that it was a kind of screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying through the movie and that through luck (for example: the guy from the pharmacy turning into a good chef) and some cleverness on his part gets away from it most of the time. <br /> <br /> Although it was not as funny as I expected and there was a little bit of wasted talent, but overall it's still a good movie.
