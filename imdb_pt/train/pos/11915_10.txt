But how can you keep a baseball team that can not win? For George Knox, this is not easy. When the film begins, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend, J.P (Milton Davis Jr.), are riding their bikes around the angel's stadium. When they return to their foster mother's home, Roger is surprised to receive the visit of his father (Dermot Mulroney). Your mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they're going to be a family again, he jokes, "I say when the angels win the division championship." Then, later, Roger and J.P hide in a tree to see the angels playing baseball. When the manger George Knox (Danny Glover) picks up his pitcher, the pitcher gets irritated and gets into a fight with him, and soon the team of angels enters the fight that causes Knox to be kicked out of the game. That night Roger prays, as the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP go to a basball, Roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) catch him, leaving the prey and play-by -Joker (Jay Sanders) How did he do it? Roger learns from the angel of the head (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles, because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
