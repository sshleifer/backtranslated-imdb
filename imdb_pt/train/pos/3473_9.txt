I admit that I had some fear when I first saw the previews for this movie. Was VH-1 stepping on hollow soil here? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not really look or sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit, this movie really surprised me. It is far from the film of exploration that I expected. Instead, it is a study of character, a discreet, capricious look, and finally bittersweet with friendship, and the last lesson we have learned: it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we have already had and what has passed us by.
