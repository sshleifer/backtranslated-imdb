I could not wait to get my hands on this when I read about Fred Astaire joining George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script written by P.G. Wodehouse and Gershwin music. It's definitely worth seeing, but it lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies. <br /> <br /> The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where moods get better. Some of the performances are frankly painful to watch (notably the boy and the maiden). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but the boy does her in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand on one of those spinning discs at an amusement park? Imagine tapdancing in a high heel! It accompanies wonderfully Astaire and adds a lot to the overall quality of the image. <br /> <br /> Several cool songs, particularly fun, are: Nice Work if you can and Stiff Upper Lip. <br /> /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns and Allen. I had to go back and watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
