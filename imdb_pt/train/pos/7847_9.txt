Believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this movie (for 1912) is a complete movie. Very, very few movies were longer than at that time, but that's definitely not what sets this weird little movie apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all actors (except for a frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This little domestic comedy might look a lot like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead, Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked like bugs). Chaplin, Laurel, and Hardy were still to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved, danced and fought incredibly well - and much more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking around for a long time. He goes to an obscene club while his wife supposedly waits at home. But unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he gets caught on camera by a local movie buff. Besides, he does not know, but Mrs. Beetle is also doing a bohemian locust painter. Of course, there is much more to this domestic comedy than that, but the plot is old and very entertaining for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Strange, but also very surprising and watchable.
