I found this a very entertaining children movie that really is geared more towards adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. Some things are inappropriate for children, but only a few. Likewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) breaks so many jokes that you can not keep up with them, ranging from sexual to cultural, from insider-Hollywood to racial. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairstyles of people here are fun to watch. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasing, so having his narrative lifts the film further. Your rhymes are fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the theater, although it was "fair", but on DVD, it was much better. I've seen it three times and it got better each time.
