This is making movies in a simple way and it's best. <br /> <br /> I had my doubts, because even if Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects; This is not one of those moments. <br /> <br /> It's a little story that lasts just over an hour and a half, in an age when we're getting used to having ever longer, not necessarily better, movies, the director uses the short time to his favor, because the characters are so well defined from the outset (great portraits of freeman and Vega, by the way), that the little background information on them seems real, Morgan is himself name is not mentioned, he is out of the movie there is a few years because he was saturated in business and developed a fear of committing to a script, and is researching a character in an independent film where he plays a movie. store manager / supermarket. The story begins with being dropped off at a supermarket in a rustic neighborhood where he finds the box of 10 items or less (Vega) and has to get a ride with her because "production" forgot to pick it up. In many ways, it's a road movie, Morgan provides the laughter and quirks with his unbeatable smile and positive outlook at everything, showing an accomplished actor who trained his mind to be able to set everyone he sees in a character he could interpret, and Peace (by the way, that extraordinary beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a twenty-five-year-old woman who works more than anyone else without receiving any credit from a dead person. Finish work in a low quality supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a talkie, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well sustained, the characters become so kind that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for longer It's a strange couple, but the brevity is in the nature of the story, so it was a good call from the director not to give in.
