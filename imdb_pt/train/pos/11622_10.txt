Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action / suspense written and directed by the own master of the suspense Wes Craven. The entire movie begins with some problems at The Lux Atlantic, a Miami hotel. The problem is solved by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. So she goes to the airport, and that's where the whole problem begins. She knows Jackson Rippner, who does not like being called Jack because of the name of Jack the Ripper, if you know you and I mean. Then they board the plane and, crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrified, tormented and terrified by Rippner. I will not give up anything. Then we head to where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. So Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is well, and madly, Rippner is already there. There are almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout the scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action come at the end. <br /> <br /> Not only was the movie intense, but it also had a great plot. Like I said, I will not give anything because it's so shocking and exciting and a bit disturbing / scary. And the performance of each character in the film, even those without lines, were all perfect. It was amazing. Everything was amazing in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the makeup, the direction, the edition, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the master of suspense. Red Eye is definitely a must-see and it is definitely worth spending your money. You could watch this movie over and over again and it would never be boring. <br /> <br /> The Red Eye, I have to say, is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The MPAA: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence and language < My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Unsettling Content
