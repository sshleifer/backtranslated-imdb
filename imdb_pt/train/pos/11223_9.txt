Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the game world proud. The various movements with the fists had to be learned, since playing dice is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I expected the 'good girl' to cry for her grave, instead of her friend. Especially with her remarks about "going to her best friend's funeral" when she met Matt. And of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid on Allen's face, blinding him (Bruce Dern's interesting role). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of the other Hollywood finals happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting so careful that you have not the slightest knowledge. <br /> <br /> And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Taking us back to the 1950s, when our "native passions" were unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a bit of racism boiling in Chicago, but in a club called, wonderfully, "Biloxi" with a Confederate flag supporting racist remarks. I'll be watching again, just to listen to the song. Glad I got the FACTOTUM soundtrack, so I can hear it in the car. Watch the two together and you'll see how Matt has matured .... playing bar-room characters in both. No matter that he owns a bar at Paramount HOtel in New York, he probably has a great opportunity to do his studies. Great actor, just coming on your own. He shows well differentiated performances ... the good and the bad in his characters. His "young boy off the farm" is a great study, especially poignant because of his dachshund eyes. He makes love convincingly too. Since he's been in several movies with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how it's ... making love to an actress you kind of grew up with. Add conviction, I'll say it.
