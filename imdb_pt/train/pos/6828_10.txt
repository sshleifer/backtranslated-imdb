The film stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, and John Cassavetes, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a special guest of Peter Falk. The premise of the film: an aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands) reevaluates her life after an obsessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark quality, scary and scary. It has a cinematic look from the 60's and even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are those that every successful actress has - she is aging and she will become useless in her career. In addition, she feels that she has lived a life that has no spirituality, humanity and merit. She lived only for her career, she has no children, no charity, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the flesh of this film. She's falling apart. She is in crisis. Gena Rowlands really enters the character's tormented psyche and acts very well. She is a great actress and this 70's movie is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the time and the movies of catastrophe or adventure thrillers. It's a movie with a lot of deep emotion, but it has a cold and cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes was criticizing the main films and actors of the 70's generation. Either this or this movie is a product of the 70's, which was cynical in many respects - the mistake of Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although production figures are not large, and this film is not well known, it is a very haunting film with haunting moods. Congratulations to the underestimated and late director Cassavetes, who died in the late 1980s.
