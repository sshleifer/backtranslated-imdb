This movie shows the kind of work you want in all the movies. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play the role of husband and wife) are chilling, discussing the "family business" like a grocery store or a laundry. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are great too. They have fun as members of a high-level theatrical troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support others disinterestedly. And finally, there's Sammy (David Dorfman). What an incredible performance of a child ... and what a strange resemblance he has with Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We are treated to a unique story in "Panic", and this is a rarity in these days of tired stereotypical crap. The dialogue is crisp and clever, and this relatively short movie, however, has the power to extract a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be horrified, to be sad, excited, angry and loving. It's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy, but when it's over you're more than satisfied knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes trying a good job. <br /> <br /> Most of us go to theaters if we were treated to such a quality fare. When will the powers that be in Hollywood wake up? It's a shame when something like that can not be exposed beyond festivals and homes that are lucky enough to have cable TV.
