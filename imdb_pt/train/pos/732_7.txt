Well, I finally reached Rock'n'Roll High School, almost 30 years after it became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Delayed that I am, I'll probably see the new documentary this summer " Patti Smith: "Dream of Life" by 2040!) And no, the film does not seem a bit dated, but worth the wait. This is a high energy comedy that features lots of good music and some amazing moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, played with adoration by PJ Soles, and the battle she and her Vince Lombardi High counterparts fought against the new repressive director, Miss Togar (Danny Peary in her book "Cult Movies" Mary Woronov's performance as a "Eve Arden.") A typical story of teenagers versus Establishment is reinforced here with some absurd humor (those mice that explode, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel monitor) and some truly exciting songs I la ff is, of course, the # 1 fan of the original punk band The Ramones, and this band features a dozen of their biggest songs throughout the film, including five in a show that is a total blast. In fact, Riff's vision dancing furiously to "Teenage Lobotomy" in this explosion may be the funniest moment in the picture. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later sneaking down a street singing "I Just Want To Have Something To Do", is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that, I imagine, the wet dream of every high school kid. Fun things, in fact. On a side note, the Ramones were one of the loudest bands I've ever seen in concert, so I had a blast to note that the DVD for this movie comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aged punks out there found these necessary legends, I wonder ....
