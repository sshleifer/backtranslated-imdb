On paper, this movie would sound incredibly annoying. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling the interior on a lawnmower certainly does not have much appeal for this, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenager. She is pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about her own kids, a long time ago. He made each of them take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he made them pack the sticks and try to break them. "This package," he said, "is family." So many other films would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we are smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate thinking and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey through Iowa is filled with such a refreshingly non-Hollywood character. interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can not help but smile when he makes his way to Wisconsin to make amends with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not fate but the journey. It is a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he knows - for his benefit and for ours. It is a slow, simple and relaxing walk to remind us of everything we have lost with the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare "G" movie live. This really should not be missed. Grade A
