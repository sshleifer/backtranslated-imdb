This movie is great and I would recommend renting it to anyone who has the local video store. Or, better yet, you could buy it because you'll probably watch it over and over again. I remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then. But after watching it again yesterday I found it incredible. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (although not as good as "Mr Magoo" - another of my favorites) and action. That deserves 10/10 and I hope they do a follow up soon (fingers crossed). If you do babysitting or have to take care of small children for anything, then I highly recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :).
