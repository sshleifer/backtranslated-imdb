for anyone playing video games here noticed that the GTA: Vice City Mansion inside the game and a few other things, including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the creators of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy Some things in this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80's movies out there, I recommend this to anyone who has not seen it yet 10/10 without questions
