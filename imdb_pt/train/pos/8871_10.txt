This was a great movie that had a lot of underlying issues. It dealt with issues of rascism and class. But he also had a message of knowing himself and taking responsibility for himself. This movie went very deep, gave the message that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way to fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe this movie did a wonderful job in showing it. The actors that I think were able to convey each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. With a look of astonishment, you would not see how deep the film is, but as you look further, you see the underlying meaning of the film.
