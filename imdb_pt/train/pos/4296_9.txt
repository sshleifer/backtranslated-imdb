This would have been my number one film of the year for 1991 except that it was hit by the brilliant JFK. This is a wonderful movie! I loved. I love stories in which the lives of different characters intersect with each other and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here but is overshadowed by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I've never really liked Martin or his style, but here he's great. I loved all the speech he gave to Kline near the final over the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, along the paths of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought-out stories, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives. A truly excellent film. 4 out of 5 stars
