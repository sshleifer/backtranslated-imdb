Definitely a very good idea, the script was just OK. It could have been better, the good points are that you will not be bored if you are an adventure lover, a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The natives are that I personally feel that this idea had a lot more potential than that. They should have ended up with a better adventure than that. It was not bad, but it would have been much better with a bit more runtime. I really enjoyed that, saying it was boring or not good .. Good for people who like adventure animations like Sindbad, like the road to el Dorado. This movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very good happy ending.
