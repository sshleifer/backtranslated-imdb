the first and only season just went on the air here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! all the story lines are so good! and it's a much more realistic view on teenage and family life today. however, still maintained strong family values ​​of uniting and being there for each other. your problems were real, and really attracted you to the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (gay daughter), Cooper Day (son from outside) and Nathan Day (son of genius). each episode one day of his life, with prospect of coopers on things throughout it. I loved cooper their sight through the show was great. he was by far my favorite character. ended with so many things that could have continued, I'm really sad that another season has not been made. It was a great show that I'm going to miss.
