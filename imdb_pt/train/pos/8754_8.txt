I watched this movie 11 years ago in the company of my best friend. I took my teeth out of the judgment so as not to feel very good. <br /> <br /> I ended up enjoying it very much. It is a hard watch if you take into account that deals with friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug dealing and the extreme difficult situation that deals with life in a foreign jail. <br /> <br /> The acting is at its main level. Two of the women I most like star and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as cute and charming as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is extremely sexy and performs well. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many twists in history and an interesting visual experience. It also shows the difficult times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie. Not many movies like this have emerged in recent history. This should make you think about many things ...
