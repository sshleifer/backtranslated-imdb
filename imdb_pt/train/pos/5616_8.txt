What can be said, really ... "The Tenant" is a first-class thriller made with equal amounts of suspense and total paranoia. It's an intricately planned movie - every detail seems included for a reason - even though the plot seldom makes sense, and much of it is never addressed objectively. So we stayed with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - a tame Polish man who got an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide - to guide us through a world of increasing fear and uncertainty. After a heated apartment party thrown by a group of obnoxious co-workers, Trelkovsky undergoes a seemingly inexplicable examination of fellow occupants of his building; the rest of the film recounts his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough understanding with the later efforts of David Lynch. "The tenant," however, is more thoughtful and sinister, bound with unexpected comic relief, great performances, and a truly astounding score. It's a movie that is better experienced than described, so go for it.
