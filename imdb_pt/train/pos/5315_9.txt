This movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. All the actors are very real and very strange. The "general aspect" of the film was also different, half dreamy and faded, which only contributed to the spatial vibration, strange and weird of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean, it's not what you'd call "mainstream," but that's what I liked. It's unlike anything I've seen before. . . unpredictable, with a strange beat and punch in the strangest places. Children are so painfully goofy (and prickly) that you can not help but feel for them. In other words, they are far from "hollywood" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> All this, to me, is good.
