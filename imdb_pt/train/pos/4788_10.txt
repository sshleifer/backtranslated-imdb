This is one of the biggest movies I have ever seen: I shone through the entire film. Music and cinematography held the spell when little happened on the screen. The slow pace was defined by the mode of travel (a lawnmower with a large trailer) and was maintained by background visions and sounds and the slow lives of the other characters. <br /> <br /> The story really happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no action; everything was completely real, as if the actors had become the characters. Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat handicapped daughter who suffered a lot, but moved on, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was chosen to perfection and he became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who crosses Iowa to visit his estranged brother, Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin learned a lot of wisdom during his lifetime and this seemed to bring out the best of the people he encountered along the way. <br /> <br /> The film highlights the importance of the family to this man and, hopefully, to all. of us. I look forward to seeing this again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves his ability as a director. Farnsworth was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; at age 79, he was the oldest candidate to be awarded.
