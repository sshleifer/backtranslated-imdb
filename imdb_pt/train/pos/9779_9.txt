Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home but change in some way. In the first story, our former cult member is now in a madhouse and is visited by an account that wants to know about what happened in the cult. A bit slow as the story is told in flashbacks as the two sit in chairs and face each other. Reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants. What seemed a little boring suddenly becomes very exciting with an astounding twist in the story. Things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> The second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist to do mandatory therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda, but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again, things get a bit smaller and they look strange. Then there is a strange twist in the story that is very well written and amazing. <br /> <br /> The final story deals with the spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the illness from their person with their hands. One of the patients is a former member of the sect, so successful healing becomes more complicated. Once again, we are surprised by a turnaround. There's a pretty bloody scene over there. <br /> <br /> There is some beautiful frontal frontal nudity as well as male frontal nudity for some reason. I found the stories very well written and the director succeeded in putting together each story with its amazing turnaround and bloody consequences. <br /> <br /> Note: Review of the German DVD.
