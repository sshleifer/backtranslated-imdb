A humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to spend a week in Tomawka, a camp in Ontario. Canada by its former consuidor (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder drew on his experience in the same field as the main source for creating a smooth and understanding wire that makes sense. In addition, the film has many funny moments, some of which are completely bizarre as my favorite, which involves the use of duct tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") provides the film with some stunning images of the Canadian desert. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of the films "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as Arkin's clumsy right-hand man. One more thing, this film has assured me that a camp does not have to be a bloody murder site.
