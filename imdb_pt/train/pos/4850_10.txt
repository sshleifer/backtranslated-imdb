So your kids are out in a sleep? Is the wife visiting her mother-in-law? You are at home. Is it a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the television and the dishwasher needs to be stacked? So now what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make an old-fashioned cocoa (Frys is the best!) Take some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now go select and play Arthur Askeys two World War II thriller / horror The Ghost Train, go back to that comfy couch and enjoy the evening! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a genuine British wartime classic! Arthur Askey with his side kick, Stinker Murdoch, entertain him and I suspect the cast, at a high octane, thrill and leaks, espionage thriller.It is in old rural England during World War II. <br /> <br /> It centers around a heterogeneous group of people who need to spend the night in circumstances beyond the control of anyone in an old railway waiting room that they discover to be haunted by an old train . <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit for the whole cast is humorous in parts and sometimes truly scary! <br /> <br /> (The tale was written by the old Godfrey of Dads Army and it's clever) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is fun and is very much at home pre-forming his routines for you and the cast , it also shows that he can act a little! The cast is never staged though, even the railroad porter and the parrot help give the film the seriousness it needs. <br /> <br /> Oh, and when you finish please remember to stack the dishwasher!
