I loved this movie. Not being a fan of Ed Wood Jr., I'd rather appreciate his "unlimited enthusiasm" and recognize his shortcomings. Your movies are fun, but your personal story is full of pain. I hoped, and was happy to find out, that this movie would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply huddling him with posthumous compliments. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary to a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we have are people who knew Ed Wood Is better talk about it from all perspectives, positive and negative, and show us his character as much as Ed's. We have a vision of Ed's personal and professional life: from his novels, his drunkenness, his sexuality, his friends, his enemies and even his movies. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is filmed. in a low-budget way that seems made out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most movies released in the movies in 1996 was disrespectful (as if it were a prettier suit than the president). The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great vision by combining each member of the cast with his past. <br /> <br /> Fans will be excited to hear the personal testimony of Ed Wood's controversy, and the newcomers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of finding impossible gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the true treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story. Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through his association with him (for good or evil), to the point of a woman entering the story as "Pool Owner" for once let him and his friends be baptized in his pool. This ability to define a person's legacy comes in a universal way, since the most amazing effect of the film is not only to give a complete idea of ​​the man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community he created. Somehow, without ever having one cast member being interviewed onscreen each time, Ed Wood's connection between the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer gets a great sense of involvement. <br /> </ p> <p> Even the title suggests the B-type horror genre, but in the end, we even see that it's a kindness. What begins as independent stories of random people ends with the conclusion that the entire cast will forever be transformed into an unpredictable and cohesive fabric that history will bring to obsessive unity with Wood's legend. <br /> <br /> In many ways contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed into a single point of view. This collaborative effort is as close to knowing it as we can get. Being in itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at the same time respectful, provocative, thoughtful, exciting, amusing, sad, gentle and gratifying.
