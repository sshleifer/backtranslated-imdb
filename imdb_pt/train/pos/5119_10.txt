I just have to say, this is one of my all time favorite movies. I can not even count the number of times I've seen this. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera does his body after he's all shaved and handsome for his first trip to Gilley, I was amazed. Debra Winger, as always, performs perfectly as Bud's naive young wife, but with the attitude necessary to marry a stubborn, hard-working cowboy. If you are not a country music person, which I was not, this is a soundtrack that will make you sing along with every word. If you have a chance, please watch this movie, it will not disappoint.
