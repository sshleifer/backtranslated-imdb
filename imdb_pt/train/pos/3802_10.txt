Dragon Hunters has to be the most beautiful animated film I have ever seen. It was jaw-dropping. The movie is about some ladinos in search of some money, their weird blue hairy dog ​​that makes fire, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent on a mission to go to the ends of the earth to kill the gobbler of the world, a vastly immense dragon. But honestly, it does not even matter what the movie is about. Because, it's cute to drop your chin. The gravity in this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float amidst cathedrals, castles and villages, and there are forests of floating lilies. The world is so creative, so singularly beautiful, with a kind of soft storybook. The world looks like a set of beautiful paintings. The monsters are visually stunning too, like a fire dragon made up of a swarm of evil red bats. Some of the plots are not very original, like the main protagonists who want their farm to the one of rats and men and never seem to be able to do it in the world; but the beautiful graphics, some seriously sinister scenes and the emotion-evocative dialogue make this movie spectacular.
