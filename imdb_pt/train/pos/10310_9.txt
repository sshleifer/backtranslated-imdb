Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was actually quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual nightmare. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is more sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is not sacred, but neither is it sacrilege, at least not to a great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low point. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who has his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell them right away that they love each other, but the relationship is in a very unstable terrain. <br /> <br /> Bruce then has a shot at the anchor, only to have him stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously, no please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television in a way that is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired. <br /> <br /> Much complaining and complaining about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of calling, then he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the chief, electrician, and janitor of the building. I found this a lot of fun. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is the electrician, and Jesus Christ is the caretaker. Think about it. Chief, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Keeper, the guy who cleans up the mess the world left. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Bruce is a bit skeptical about actually finding God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a chance to play God, he starts to believe a little. I wonder why. Enter the blatant abuse of powers for personal gain and for abusing enemies. <br /> <br /> Once this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually learns, learns his lesson and begins to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he cries out for God to take him away and prays that his will be done, not Bruce's. <br /> <br /> As it is Jim Carrey, the film is a lot of fun, and definitely there are some very fun. moments in it. The film is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it's definitely a good try. Many statements in the film can be quite thought-provoking and challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this film. <br /> <br /> So, while far from perfect, definitely a fun popcorn movie with a little thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a sight or two)
