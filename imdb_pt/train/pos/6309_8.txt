I saw this gem of a movie in Cannes, where it was part of the directors' fortnight. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun everywhere, with all members of a strong cast acting with their socks. It's a comedy that sometimes laughed out loud about a petty thug (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and get sent to jail. While in prison he meets a 'lifer' who tells him about 'the last bellini' ?? What for you and me? is a fast and rich scheme. Turns out there is a way through an abandoned building to the jewelry store of cities? which could yield millions. Does it sound simple? ??? Well play on all sorts of crazy characters and incidents along the way and you have the ingredients for a wild ride !! ??? The word goes from a low-quality loser to the next and soon a team of them is set up to try to gain the lead of Cosimo `bellini 'by bankrupt boxer Pero (superbly played by Sam Rockwell - certainly a star in training) and reluctant Crook Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby along with him while his wife was arrested for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Great Deal on Madonna Street), which also inspired a movie similar to 'Collinwood'? `Palookaville '. This hits points of the last effort and although it is written and directed by the Russo brothers it definitely has shadows of the Coen Brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but fun role as a crippled safe breaker.
