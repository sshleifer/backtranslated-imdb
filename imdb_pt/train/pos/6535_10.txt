This movie was great! Even though there were only about 15 people, including myself there, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mother even liked it. There were two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to have fun. I love the part where Corky and Ned are like liking Nancy and stuffing her cute lol. And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there. Yeah, that was a great movie, I even thought people underestimated it. Come on, I bet you'll like it !! I really liked it and my friend too. <br /> <br /> People were so hard on this movie and did not even see it. I bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance. They all did a great job in my opinion. But if you have small children it is still appropriate. I'll probably take my 7 year old niece to see it too.
