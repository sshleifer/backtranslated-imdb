I originally saw this movie years ago during the Cinemax Friday after dark series (when the cable box was built as a keyboard), and it intrigued me. Even if there is a meaningless aspect to the film, it is well represented. The performances of Depardieu and Dewaere are very pleasant. They have good chemistry together and Miou-Miou leaves the skin pink with an exciting look. be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the US), since it seems to sensationalize things like violence, theft and casual sex. This film proves that with a talented and also talented casting a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject. I was saddened to find out that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the near future I will check him out with Depardieu & Miou -Mie in Get Out Your Hankerchief.
