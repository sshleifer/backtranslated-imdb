A masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was, the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is all that a sequel should be. He does not step on the fingers of his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that it was the first film to live in some unique immortality. <br /> <br /> Snowy River II Man is based on Jim Craig's return to Snowy River Country after a three year absence. The film subtly tells a tale of change in the 19th century, from Australian history, legend and horses. The plot demonstrates a Hollywood touch in lighter tones, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, but this only fits in with the distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more vibrant than the first film, and much more colorful, with particular aspects of the former incorporated into the film, although The Man from Rio Nevado II has all the essential features of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, an impressive focus of the Australian highland, the second most impressive horse filming ever filmed, and a fantastic and deeply touching soundtrack by Bruce Rowland, who equals the first in every way. Geoff Burrowes has done an excellent job with this film, and is highly commendable, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian film industry. The main cast, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and a well-replaced one, Brian Dennehy, carry their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film. As far as the sequences can go, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspiring experience once again.
