As the Padrinho saga was the mafia vision of the executive suite, this series is a complex Mafia tale from the worker's point of view. If you have never watched this program, you are about to receive an extended treatment. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never gratuitous and it is necessary to contrast Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of life he was born to, and frankly, he would never have left even knowing how many of his associates had ended up. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of fury, and while dismembering and dismembering the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch the TV while you eat peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew's advice at their upcoming wedding as they had just finished a Sunday afternoon watching NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when given a chance to leave, discovers that she really prefers life with Tony and the benefits that go with it and that, looking the other way, are indiscretions against life on their own. If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you did not, believe me, you've never seen a TV show end like this.
