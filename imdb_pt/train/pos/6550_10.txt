Look, if I was interested in a Nancy Drew book, what I would do would be to get a book and read it. I'm not. As far as I remember, I read people destroying movies because it was not like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age, we can no longer watch movies on flipbooks, but I'm sure it's still possible to find some short films in book format. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won an Oscar - "The book was better." When I watched To Kill a Mockingbird, "the book was better." Now a lot of people are upset, yet again, because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew will win any Oscars - if anything is going to be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm saying give time to the movies. It's film, not paper. As a film, I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring special appearances by Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper in O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I see Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I like her work more than most of Julia and Eric; his character remains consistent throughout the film and reacts well to conflict. A cheerful movie in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is good from time to time. <br /> <br /> I'll give ten stars because I really liked the movie, I'd love to see it again, and I'll probably buy it on DVD release.
