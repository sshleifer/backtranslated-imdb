This western is done in a way different from most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming to work on Rip Torn at his ranch. As this is presented it makes for a more interesting slice of Americana. I'd rather see this on the big screen than on the tape, but it's worth taking a look to see how life was back in the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excel in this movie.
