The Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors that I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the most entertaining comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> This is a good Three Stooges short. It's funny and its cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Bonifacio, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Conklin Chester, Theodore Lorch, Brent Lynton, Judy Malcolm, John Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess. The Stooges did very well in this short! I highly recommend this!
