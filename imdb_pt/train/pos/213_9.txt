Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedian, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for more than 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took the personal side and held grudges ever since. This is the premise of this hilarious piece by Neil Simon made in a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns at their peak, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau's nephew and agent. There are even old clips of real-stars from the golden age to get you into the rhythm of the movie, and actor Fritz Feld starts it all with a pop. Rosetta LaNoire, who started out in the 1930s in the theater with Orson Welles and later was a grandmother in "Family Matters", is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with her (and maybe I'm being very picky and / or serious) is how Matthau treats Burns when they meet. It is true that he has had much resentment all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or simply bad ways out of context. Besides, I'm used to seeing Matthau acting like that in other films, but not in George Burns. And, Matthau's scream tends to get a little old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a consistently funny movie to help and forget about your problems, put it in "The Sunshine Boys". They will raise your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slip." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to slip."
