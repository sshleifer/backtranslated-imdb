I'm certainly glad that a movie was made about the incredible life story of Carl Brashear. Just as happened during the Civil Rights era, Brashear has become an inspiration to people of all minority groups who do not want to settle for the expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he chose. Much like Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and kept him faithful to his character and conduct. Like Brashear, Gooding knows he does not want the life of a beggar that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it very clear to take more of his life than he has. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman joined Armed Services after World War II, the Navy still has its restrictions. A negro can only be an official cook or knave, the real combat parts are denied him. This is not good enough for Gooding, who is applying to become a Navy diver. <br /> <br /> Once at the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding takes everything for him, especially by the Chief Master Chief. responsible, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have a few prejudices left over, but he is nevertheless a hero and one that can inspire if one can pass the racial divide. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, they both become Men of Honor. Other good performances are Charlize Theron as wife of DeNiro and Hal Holbrook as the head of the dive school, a guy the Navy would like to retire for reasons you will see. <br /> <br /> Men of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.
