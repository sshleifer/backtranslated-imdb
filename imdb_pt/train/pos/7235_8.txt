"A Girl's Folly" is a sort of half-comedy, half-mockumentary look at the movie business of the mid-1910s. We get a glimpse of life in one of the first movie studios, where we try to set up a scenario by passing for a scene, dealing with beloved movie fans and even having lunch in the cafeteria. We are also aware of little-known cinematic facts - for example, did you know that "actors of 'movies' often do not know the plot of the image they are working on?" The plot of This movie, in essence, is the discovery of movie star Kenneth Driscoll and the romance of a young star he discovers while filming on location in the country. I believe the 30-minute version I watched was summarized, included on the same tape with "The Cheat" by Cecil B. De Mille. It's a very credible film - an easy watch with a great cast of extras. As a bonus, it includes some of the best illustrated captions I've seen with a silent movie.
