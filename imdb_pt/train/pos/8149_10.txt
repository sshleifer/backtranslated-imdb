I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in 1994 and I watched it recently and it's still funny. I do not know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you understand. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal disputes between groups and members when separated (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There were also the wanna b's, accessible rappers who started making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc). This movie makes fun of it all in a way that looks like a documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of a fictional name of rap group N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott) and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence) who are a rising rap group whose politics makes them controversial. about this movie is that he's so rich in his 80's hip-hop interpretation of the hip hop industry and how he enjoys it, but if you know 80's rap, you know how true that is. , by itself, without the knowledge of hip hop, is still a funny funny movie. And for all those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie as well. Spinal Tap is a heavy metal band, Fear of The Black Planet is for Rap, and the songs are off the hook as well.The DVD is full of extras chalk to include music videos from NWH as a group and as solo artists. The brilliant performances of Rusty Con dieff and Larry B Scott.
