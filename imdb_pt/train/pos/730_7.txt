I liked this movie that I remember there was a very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is lying in her bed smoking marijuana and then she starts to visualize that the Ramones are in the room with her singing the song " I Want You Around "... very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes, I admit the ending is way above expectations, but it does not matter, because it's fun, it's a really fun movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll Forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that originally would star in this ... But I do not know if this is true or not.
