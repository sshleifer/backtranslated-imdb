If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy / girlfriend, or the first love of dog ... this movie is for you! Okay, so this movie would and never win an Oscar, but as a Dominican I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that can go through your head if you're not part of the culture ... the kids being raised by a grandmother who is mother and father, the younger son being drooled and bathed with a can of Bustelo coffee (sooo Dominican!), Judy being harassed by the men of the neighborhood, going to church and lighting a candle of prayer ... the brilliance of the film was in those little details. Sure, it was not a cinematographic extravaganza of all the works, but it was not to be NOR, it was to be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (hint: make new friends). More than a documentary, sweetly false, this film kept it real without taking it too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien," this was simply the tale of a boy's coming of age. I recommend (especially if Dominican!) = O)
