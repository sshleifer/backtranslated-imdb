The woman in black is fantastic in every way. It's scary, suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life. I saw this for the first time on TV in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume on, it was probably the most frightening experience of my entire life. I managed to get a copy, and now, I bring out every Halloween and show it to the unsuspecting family members, who have no idea what they're doing, and all I can do is laugh with joy. As for the movie: It starts with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is assigned by his company to go to the mercantile city of Crythin Gifford to solve the roles of a recently deceased client - Mrs. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This movie begins as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story. But then, Arthur attends the funeral and, from that scene, we do not feel safe. We are constantly on the edge and bite our nails, and this continues for the next hour, until the final and exciting final. <br /> <br /> An alert to all new viewers: do not watch it alone. ..
