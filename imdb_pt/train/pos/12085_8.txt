Shirley MacLaine in other sized paper. As the aunt of a single mother in a working-class Chicago neighborhood in 1962, the veteran character actress gets another job as a brave woman who does not allow any setback to defeat her spirit of success. The children, a preteen boy and a girl, are drawn to the lively Aunt Zoe, although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her and applied at all the wrong opportunities end up being expelled from school. <br /> <br /> The plot is cleverly involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis with all the social implications. Men building anti-aircraft shelters, people watching news shows on what appeared to be the only TV set in a diner, and a general haze of malaise and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is blown out of proportions, the climatic conclusion, however, makes the viewer feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will rise tomorrow! Clearly a low-budget production, this is still a sweet little movie, full of the magic that Sunday's Matinees was made of. With some "Oldies" cast on an effective soundtrack, the whole family will surely like that.
