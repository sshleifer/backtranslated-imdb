I saw this movie when I was little. And I've enjoyed this every time. Of course the graphics are a bit cheesy, compared to now, but in the 70's it was great. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. That's how I remember that my Christmases were with my family - magicians. Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, raise them by watching this old version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version of the one we're used to today, but who says there's a way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good versus bad. I do not know how the subtitled version is in English or if there is one in English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Merry Christmas!
