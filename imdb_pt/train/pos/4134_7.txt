Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star in "Lady X's Divorce," a 1938 comedy based on one play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the fog of London is too dense for guests at a costume ball to return home. The next day, a friend of his, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man in the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. Believing the woman to be Oberon, Olivier panics. Oberon, who is single and granddaughter of a judge, pretends to be the lady in question, Lady Mere, when she is really Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We've already seen this plot or variations of it dozens of times. With this cast, it's delicious. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, this great team in Wuthering Heights? Very special. Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with comedy while portraying the nervous and nervous lawyer. Oberon gives his role the right touch of light. She looks extremely young here, fuller on the face, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears some pretty street clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress she tries on, with that hairstyle, she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is charming as the real Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color of this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
