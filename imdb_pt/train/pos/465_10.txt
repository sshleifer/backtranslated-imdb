Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the great directors of the world. This sensitive and visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well the writer's somber irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his best performance (I'm not usually a fan of him); and Emily Watson is brilliant too. Worth seeing.
