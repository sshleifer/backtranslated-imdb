I went to this movie just because I was dragged there and would have gone out again immediately because the audience was mostly elderly people and I felt out of place. However, the film was totally fascinating and far from being aimed at older people. The characters were all very real and believable and I found myself discussing the movie, the characters and the plot for hours afterwards. There are some very engaging scenes, but they are necessary and help you better understand the situation. All in all, this is a great and valuable movie - a bit off the mainstream, but that does not mean that this movie can not be enjoyed by people who prefer the mainstream. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
