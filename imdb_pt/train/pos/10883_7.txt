This is surprisingly above average slasher, which is nice and well done, with some decent blood!. All the characters are decent, and the story is a lot of fun, and Molly Ringwald played the boring bitch very well. I bought this at a pawn shop for a dollar, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were very good for the budget, plus I loved the mask that the killer wore as it was actually a bit scary. The ending was really cool, as I loved how they defeated the killer, and the final, while predictable, was a lot of fun too, plus all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly very friendly! It's decently done and written, and I found it to be quite creative and original at times too, and some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer did not move, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really like this movie, but the opening was also very bad with them filming the movie! This is a surprisingly above average slasher, which is nice and well done, with some decent gore, and I say it's worth the clock!. The direction is good. Kimble Rendall does well! work here with solid camera work, using a scary setup, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace. The acting is solid! Molly Ringwald makes the bitch extremely well, and I had trouble feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she got better in the end, but not much, I'm surprised she decided to make this movie, however, she did a excellent job !. Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, scary and had a hell of a mask, and this guy did not fiddle, he was fantastic!. Kylie Minogue plays very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and works out just like the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall well worth the clock!. *** of 5
