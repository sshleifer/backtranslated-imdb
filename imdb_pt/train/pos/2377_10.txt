I waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of H. G. Wells's classic novel, "War Of The Worlds." Timothy Hines finally did it! I just could not believe how good it was! From acting, to wardrobe, to special effects out of this world, I just can not say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances by a first-rate cast! It has to be seen to be believed. I am sure that it is not. And I read all those negative comments from others and I can not believe what they were saying. We should have watched a different movie, huh? And those really bad comments from that Vegan guy, dude, whoever he is, well, he just does not know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, mr. Hines
