I really love this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter leaves you wanting more. This makes you think about what will happen in the next episode, and the struggle of trying to maintain your friendship over the years. After the end of each episode, leave a sweet and bitter taste in the mouth knowing that: A - The show was good, you can not wait for the next episode and really makes you think about what really happens to friends over the twenties. And two - the fact that the show was put "on hiatus" and we will not see the show end in its entirety. Fox obviously does not know what they did, they claim they are losing viewers in Category 18 - 49, they clearly do not know what people want to see if they get rid of a good show like "Reunion". I have a query I would like to raise. If they brought the program back and went on to another season, how would it work, since each episode is done within a year and the story is based on what happens in the space of twenty years? Your answers are most welcome. Bring back the Reunion! Bring back the Reunion!
