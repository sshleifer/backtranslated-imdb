This movie is great. I found very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. The performance was also great, as were the costumes, production, photography, direction and screenplay. <br /> <br /> A very happy family on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. A hunter then appears and is very angry and outraged at the fact that one of the deer's horns is broken. He then begins to chase the family and strange things begin to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Worth it. Congratulations to the cast, team and filmmakers. Two thumbs up!
