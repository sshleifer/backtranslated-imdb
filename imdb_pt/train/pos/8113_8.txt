This science fiction masterpiece has many flaws after publishers massacred it after its inauguration in 1936. Visually it's a wonder to behold, but the script allows for many intellectual speeches about war and progress. This gets very tacky when the actors are given the recitation of many high level messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, seem like a couple of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as the "The Boss", a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of World War II was very strange, considering that the world was on the verge of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I'm sure the war is not over as in the movie. There are some visually stunning mounting sequences that link the time jumps between different episodes of the movie. Although not as fun as I expected, this movie stays on your head long after you have seen it.
