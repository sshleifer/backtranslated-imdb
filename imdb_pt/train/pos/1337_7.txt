......... and you receive Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or even) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new topic for Bollywood. The theme was accepted, but it is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. To be honest, the topic is presented in a very clear way. But the plot has its number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented in a very "filmi" way. There are some small holes in the plot. The film picks up once Rani has her miscarriage, where you feel like you're watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the entire family sequence was exaggerated at first. The acting could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes disappoints you. Around here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, your paper is so well written that you clap whenever it solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the film, you feel more for your character, but she is overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is the perfect image. Of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money. It's amazing how she can be so compelling when she's innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from her neighbor. That role is one of the reasons I rate it as high. The support cast is like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but I found them tolerable here. The songs are really cool. The title song is my favorite of them all along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the World View) are two songs that fit perfectly into the film. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been shortened, while Punjabi's No. 1 looked boring, despite having a good dance. Otherwise, the movie is definitely worth watching.
