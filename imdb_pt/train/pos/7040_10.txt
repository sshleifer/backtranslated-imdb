This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great scenarios and scenarios. 2) It showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside a technological environment. 3) The performance of John Cusack was great. He portrayed the anguish very well. 4) It showed the vulnerabilities of all in a war situation. 5) It gave us an image of what may happen in the future in many ways. I was also impressed with acting most of the time. Hilary's performance was, I think, the most blistering. The morale and values ​​of everyone in a war situation are in dispute. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are capable of doing anything in any given situation and are equally unpredictable. Good stuff. PSP
