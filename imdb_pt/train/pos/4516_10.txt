Since Rita's Educating, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her acting as a woman helps the man she loves to tune into her feminine side is magnificent. I would never have believed in his character in the hands of a minor actress, but Walters pulls him with taste and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to date in the men's.
