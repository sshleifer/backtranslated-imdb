This is the most attractive and excellent performance that Robert Taylor has ever given. He even outgrows his wonderful performance as "Johnny Eager" coming 14 years after that movie. His appearance is still a marvel to see, but he has a maturity now that gives him an advantage in this violent and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his race, a buffalo hunter who does not kill for money, but for pleasure. His killing of wild eyes, not only of buffalo, but of human beings, is amazing to see. He is basically a lonely man, needing the people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopathic behavior. Her partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is tired of hunting, and only goes along, because he is a failure in anything else. Along the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her without success, but sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is kind of sad to watch, so fed up with the hunt, eager to get away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunk skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing. Russ Tamblyn plays the half race trying to fit into a white world. The group is a strange mixture of good and evil, young and old. In the end Taylor is scared of the buffalo, like many hunters before him had, and flees leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon his return, that night Sandy leaves with the woman, leaving Charlie in a murder attack on a quest to get Sandy and have the girl to herself. The final showdown comes in a snowstorm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Taylor's movie all the way and he was actually a very underrated actor of the time.
