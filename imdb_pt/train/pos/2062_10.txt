Firstly I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a little overdone. A scarecrow perhaps less acrobatic would have made this film much less extravagant. But overall I think it's one of the best films B. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this movie does not have the important nude factor, there are several other movies to view it. But here she gets all the spitfire, especially at the end, while she's pulling away from the swallowed scarecrow. Also Richard Elfman does a great job as a sheriff and as a drunken boyfriend. Yes, it's a low budget B movie. But of all of them I've seen, this is definitely one of my favorites.
