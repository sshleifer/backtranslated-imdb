A twenty-something spinster (played by John Travolta) leaves the ranch and heads to Houston, where he learns about life and love in a Texas honky-tonk. By face value, it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There are lots of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer plates and references to large belt and rodeo buckles. The song, if not from Texas, is adapted to Texas thanks to the talents of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and Charlie Daniels Band. And this Texas accent ... "you." <br /> <br /> The story and the characters are as subtle as the taste of the Texas Five Bell Pepper made with Jalapeno Peppers. It's enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a refined classic, one of which starring Laurence Olivier or perhaps Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I kind of like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is generally good. The dialogue, the design of the production and the costumes are all realistic; editing is skilful. And both the cast and the performance are commendable, if not Oscar-worthy. I would not have cast Travolta in the role he plays, but he does a great job ... like Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are also good at supporting roles. But cinematography seemed weak. The copy of the movie I watched was grainy, and sometimes suffered from a reddish / orange hue, a visual feature I noticed in other movies of the same time period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message". But I would say that when "Urban Cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had prophetic implications. By 1980, the US had all sorts of problems, with US hostages held by Iran. In the minds of many people back then, the US was being pushed, intimidated. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of its time, offered something that Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. .. toughness. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical film. The characters may not be the brightest people on earth. But, they are tough! <br /> <br /> Everything about "Urban Cowboy" is anti-intellectual. As a vehicle for cultural expression, then, this 1980 film was one of several that ushered in a new era for the US. It began in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that era continues to this day, with a President who probably will not be remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his toughness and aggressiveness, characteristics that Americans seem to gravitate as surely as Texans crying with five alarms.
