This movie is neither morbid nor depressing. It's sad because AIDS in the early 1990s was sad. But your true message is one of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term loving relationship. Their devotion to one another is immediately evident, and as the ravages of AIDS increase and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly comforting. When "Silverlake Life" was originally launched, I was deeply involved in the education and health of HIV / AIDS, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film was talking to me like no other AIDS movie of the day, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the same experiences I saw everyday in real life. I knew firsthand what it was like to see AIDS consuming people who were once vibrant, young, and healthy; seeing this happen to Mark and Tom in the movie was a lot like watching my real life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all those years later, still affects me.
