Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear. They are all persecuted and violently murdered by a mad Vietnam veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a very fun Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of "The Zero Boys". at fast pace and there are some good death scenes like throat cutting or ax in the neck. Unfortunately there is not much blood, so grand-guignol fans will be disappointed. However, if you are a fan of horror films give this appearance a rarity Mexican horror movies are pretty obscure (I've only seen "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so that should be another reason to see this nice slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
