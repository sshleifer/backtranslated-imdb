For years now we have seen all the horror movies that emerge, from dull Hollywood retreads like Saw 2 to horrible indie releases that are completely unmatched ... we suffer from all the bad movies hoping to find little gems like "Dark We Continue". <br /> <br /> We got to watch a screening of the movie at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I believe it ended up winning the award for best picture. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have the budget or star power of studio films, it has a serious impact on the scary atmosphere and the scary category. The acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this movie worth it. The story and the characters develop at the right pace to provide some fantastic scares. <br /> <br /> The editing and the visual fx are also excellent. And while many horror movies can not use music to their benefit, the soundtrack to "Dark Remains" only adds to their shivers. <br /> <br /> I know the movie has been shown at various festivals, but none of them have been close to me, so I can not wait to know when it will finally be released on DVD. Trust me, even if you're tired of the current state of horror movies, try this one ... you will not regret it!
