I found this film stunning, with incredible performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi portrays Artemisia so well, with hesitant but confident mannerisms, his hands mapping an idea before changing his models. The passion that Artemisia gives to his art is simply spectacular to behold. <br /> <br /> Although not every character was openly beautiful, it made the film more realistic, since facial hair and clothes were perfect for that moment. Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic.
