In the hands of smaller actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could become silly and banal. But with these two experienced actors leading the way, I found "Silent Fury" a very exciting and pleasurable little mystery. When the marriage is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was the godfather of that marriage, one can see that there is some kind of plot against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan and his lawyer have decided to refute the claim of a previous marriage, they are attended at every step by further evidence that seem to reinforce the claim that she is already truly married. While it's not too difficult to figure out who is the main baddie, it's still a lot of fun as the intensity and pace of the story grow. All in all, a good solid mystery movie with excellent performances from both top actors and an excellent supporting cast that includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.
