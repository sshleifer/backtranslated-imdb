I recently saw this movie in my International Business class. I was not expecting anything other than another boring documentary (not to say I do not love documentary, I just have a lot of bad luck with movies of that class). Imagine my surprise when this movie, which is actually a movie, came about. <br /> <br /> This film recounts all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere. Cultural confrontation shows how different the world is and how differently we perceive ourselves until someone appears and gives us an alert. I recommend this movie to anyone in business or just want to laugh, because yes, it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about it! Cheers
