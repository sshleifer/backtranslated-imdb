I do not know exactly how to explain "Darkend Room" because summarizing this would not do it justice. It is an essentially lynchiano short film with two beautiful girls in a strange and mysterious situation. I would say this short is definitely more at the end of "Mulholland Drive" of the Lynch spectrum, unlike "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It's hidden on Lynch's website and worth the search.
