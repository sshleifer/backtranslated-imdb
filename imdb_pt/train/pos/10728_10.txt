The perfect spatial fantasy film. a group of kids climbs accidentally into space and has to go back down, but that's what they do. This would not be a family movie if everyone died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the protagonist, to give a presentation at the Golden Globe, but unfortunately, neither Lea Thompson has won one. That sucks. I can not say enough, this movie is so good, Lea Thompson, you, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is the best, for sure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated and the space field was so underrated. It should have been the opposite <br /> <br /> 10 / 10-0r excellent maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
