I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I was definitely not at all interested in opera at the time, but it changed my views. I really enjoyed this movie and really enjoyed the opera ever since. I even bought several of his CDs. Who cares about his acting skills, he basically had fun, which was lovely. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many are criticizing it so harshly. It was so direct that he would not accept people who pushed him or judged him by his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. It will definitely be lost !!!
