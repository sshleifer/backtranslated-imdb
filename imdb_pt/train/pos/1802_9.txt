Okay, I saw this movie as a kid and I really loved it. My parents never bought the movie for me, but I think I'll buy it now. I'm a sucker for pre-2000 animated films. Anyway, for the actual review. <br /> <br /> What I liked: There was a real picture of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in animated films. Character development existed! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (eg Charlie is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical but believes in Charlie, Carface is obviously the ruthless villain, etc.). I also loved the music of King Gator. I've always loved tall, annoying, and extravagant guys. This song may have been random, but it was a lot of fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could say that Charlie was all rude and things and the scenarios were beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: The real picture of heaven: The way Charlie reacted to it, "no surprises", arrived really does look very annoying. He denied a place in heaven and still managed to return to it in the end. I remember a few lines of certain songs like "... you can not keep a good dog down", "... let's make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead" but not I can remember most of any of them. The songs were not so captivating, to be honest. Whippet Angel: She's annoying and this NECK! AUGH! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS MAY NOT LIKE: Some very scary (depending on the viewer) images from Hell are shown during the movie. Carface is quite menacing. Beer is also implied, but not actually beer DUBBED. The game is a key element in the movie. The good guy dies. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: I love this movie, even if it's a bit forgettable at times. The scariest children's animations are always my favorites. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to scare the kids from time to time. Nowadays, this would probably have been classified as PG. Children under 8 years (or easily disturbed children) should not watch this. Also, I give 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy Visualization!
