Of course, 65 years have passed since the last production of Thalberg was filmed. But fellow members of IMDB, come on, this movie is certainly one of the masterpieces of the thirties! It's a 10. This was the first movie I saw at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Dear looking still scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always engaging, for me was the MGM movie at its best. What the public felt when they caught sight of an onslaught of locusts, the personal destruction of a mansion, the horrible poverty, and then the splendor of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those who attended the Oscars had a glimpse of the "senior" Oscar winner present, Luise Rainer. It's good to see an actress who undoubtedly made one of the most haunting and haunting performances in history, choosing to return to a party. <br /> <br /> Ok, so she should not have won the year before (Great Ziegfeld), but do not blame Luise. The Talkies had only a decade when this was released, and their dialogue was limited. But like Olan, his use of visual and vocal is memorable. <br /> <br /> On a large scale and moving, what more a movie lover could want!
