Of all the British imperialist films like Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade, for example, this film stands out as the cream of the culture. It reflects a time when "the sun never set in the British Empire." Leave it behind. I will not talk about why, because many others have expressed the many reasons that make this movie great. I visited the Alabama hills and photographed the gorge through which the British marched and remained as they were, unchanged by time and the invasion of man and vandals. And even though I know it's coming, seeing Din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din!" You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Though I've girded you and skinned you, <br /> <br /> Live Gawd that made you, <br /> <br /> You're a better man than me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> I still, at age 54, get nauseous and anyone who says I'm not a liar. <br /> <br /> The range of emotions within him is the hallmark of a great movie. another great film, Of Mice and Men.
