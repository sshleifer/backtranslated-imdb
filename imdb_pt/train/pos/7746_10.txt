Those of you who know the group of YOU know the vocalist Tom Barman. He directed this film a bit as it creates music, it's a mix of everything. This is a comedy, although mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least, and it really does not have a purpose. <br /> <br /> The film begins on a Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes from several people, some of them have nothing in common, but will contact each other during the day and in the evening. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that nobody reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, owner of a gallery, two young people constantly in contact with the law, a man who works in a cinema and two young women. Throughout the film, a man walks that has something to do with the wind. All the characters have their problems, with their family or friends or only with their own life. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Antwerp and shows several beautiful photos of the city and the port. The events of the day are not easily explained, I advise simply watching the film, there is simply too much to tell. But I can say this, Barman has a great use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mainly dance music, not really rock) to create a mood, especially the party is full of great music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience in itself, it will not make you wiser about life, maybe just that you have to live it and not waste it, or have false moral truths. <br /> <br /> In short, Veja, it's definitely worth it!
