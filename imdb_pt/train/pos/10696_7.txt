Every time I see Nicole I like her more. I love a movie like that. A woman you just will not give up, but she keeps breaking your heart. First movie I remember seeing how this was Of Human Bondage, the version of Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. The criticisms about the accuracy of the Russian spoken in this film are insignificant, it was good enough to deceive me or anyone else who does not speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people miss the point. Russians who are not goodnik have also been well chosen. Finally, I have to tip Ben Chaplin, as someone noticed, he touches a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some warmth between him and Nicole. To think, guys are PAY for it, mind blowing.
