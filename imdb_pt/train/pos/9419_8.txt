This Alec Guinness movie is a very good and fun political satire of the corporate industry, and a light eccentric character study as well. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling. on the funny kind floor, except maybe the sound effects for the experiments. But it has its fun moments, and it is very skillful in its execution. The large segment of explosions is probably the most ridiculous element. <br /> <br /> The union procedures are very amusing, very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the female socialist with a mild romantic passion for the character of Guinness. Political machinations really carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as a heavyweight. <br /> <br /> I do not think this works as well as the LADYKILLERS, or HEARTS AND TYPES HEARTS; but even Ealing's light comedy is better than nothing.
