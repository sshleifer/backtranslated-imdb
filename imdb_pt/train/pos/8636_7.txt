The film stars Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a trip to the west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer (without the knowledge of Dave) and Juliette is his poor companion, not so there. This is a good cast and the story goes on, but Pitt is not too scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his best previous roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles in 'Homicide: Life on the Street' or the short series 'Wonderland'. <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
