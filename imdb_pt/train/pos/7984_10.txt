Man on fire, it's definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. Despite having a slow start, the story is so incredibly complex and sensitive that it stays quite well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard, named Creasy, who is plagued by his past and an alcoholic, but never gives up his duty to save his last protege, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart and enthusiastic little girl who loves so much, and acts in a very convincing way, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is a bit tricky in order to completely understand, you should watch it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> This movie is made in two parts, there is the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing is wrong, everyone is just living their happy lives until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost dead. And then there's the second part, the rest of the movie, where everything suddenly becomes complicated and somewhat horrible and disturbing when Creasy recovers from her grave wound and begins to chase and kill the numerous criminals and "La Hermamdad" who were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his most modern talents, alongside many other talented actors who have a great future ahead. It's a shame that this film has not been recognized enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for its performance, and Fanning and the director as well. And even the visual effects that were of high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like excellent thrillers, a little disturbed and full of suspense, this is the only one to see. The most incredible thing is that the elements of this movie are based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
