Spoiler !!! This movie is based on the concept of What If? Of course Mr. Destiny will be able to answer that question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks that question. Chaos Theory states that a butterfly in China could have an effect on someone here of a chain reaction. The focus of this movie is based on an event during a baseball game. This event sets in motion the Destiny of someone; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect," except Mr. Destiny uses comedy about drama. The results make a new and original movie. If someone's philosophical is tuned to "The Butterfly Effect," you're likely to appreciate Mr. Destiny. I give it 7 out of 10. Surprising that I saw the first half of this movie 3 times, and finally watched the finale on TBS.
