Since the death of Siskel and the absence of Ebert, the show was left in the incapable hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic, he just criticizes anything he does not personally like, that is, movies with country music are criticized because "I do not like country music!" and children's movies receive a standard "I do not see this now, wait until it comes out on DVD and rents for your kids!" Roeper may well be a wise idiot, but in some other field. The weekly guests seated for Ebert do better, but who wants to pick a daisy in the middle of a cow pat? All that said, it's the only show in town and that's just worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, so can you! It is your mind and thoughts that we desire. Do whatever it takes to get the usurper out of his self-declared throne.
