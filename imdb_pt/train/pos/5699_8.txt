One of the most disturbing and tragic periods of American history has begun. Members of the Summer of Love culture in the late seventies and early eighties turned out to be old tools for love beads and all the parts of the night and evolved back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. For those who could not grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, theirs was the culture of Wonderland. A love of drugs and a sense of law allied to a dislike of authority, values, and "establishment" is the world the film captures. <br /> <br /> The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that destroyed the American "house." After the battles were over, we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage. The characters in the Wonderland house are icons of the misfit of the seventies; biker part, hippie part, cheater part, all outcast. No ideology to express, only a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and fidelity to nothing. Ron, Billy and David imagine themselves as some kind of Robin Hoods with drugs. They speak of love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten; they steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and company are the end result of a strange antimatter collision like sex, drugs and rock & roll, when lab techs get bored and go on. <br /> <br /> The film is cleverly directed and rhythmic and captures the frantic world of drug addicts in its element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is a story of a transient and forgettable era.
