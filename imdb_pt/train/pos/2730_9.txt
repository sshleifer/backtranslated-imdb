I saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing then, as I'm sure it still would be. It was the first part of 1968 and this was still circulating through the cities across America and there was recently a mass murder in my hometown where I saw it where a man went into a shootout. The coolness of that close-by event combined with this dramatized real-life story has created a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really brought to life the excellent performance of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on Truman Capote's true event, and the script and direction of Richard Brooks weave the event and Truman's interpretation into a convincing film adaptation. Music by Quincy Jones effectively marks his story. I've only seen this a few times since. It was very real. Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and walking along with the killers. I would give this a 9.0 out of a possible 10. Society is so insensitive to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be seen with less effect but for anyone over 50 this will be a trademark on examination of the criminal. psyche.
