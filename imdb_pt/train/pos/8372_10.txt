What a masterpiece Take the cold war conflict and transport it into the future. This movie is a satire of the highest level. In my humble opinion, it beats Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The intelligent appointment of the two superpowers, such as the Confederation and the Market. Cons being commies and market, the west! exceptional. Clever use of the Joxs gene was ahead of its time. we are only really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot joxs addressed the front matter in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is about humble man's camaraderie and how he can surpass the wishes of the government. This movie screams NOT TO MAKE YOU TOLO THAT YOU KILL EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
