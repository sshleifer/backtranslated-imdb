This movie is one for the ages. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Because? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has brought together a true work of art. Where 99.9% of the movies these days are purely entertaining, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us the reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. Traditional media spins and turns, but Ben Coccio appears to be a school shooting, capable of going where no other media has ever been before, in the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. Although it certainly is graphic and horrifying, how could it not be? The gloves come loose, the lies and sugar coating of our media masters are set aside and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what has happened. Sometimes it's not just a loose bolt like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and us them. Society has left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your neighbor. A lesson we all must learn, thank you very much for making this film, Mr. Coccio, I look forward to your continuing your film career.
