This was just another wonderful film from the Berlin Film Festival. But unlike Sally Potter's "Yes", which I had seen a few days before, where after leaving the theater I felt a strong desire to want to embrace the whole world and was happy to be alive, this time it was exactly the opposite. : there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly seemed cold and difficult to breathe. It was as if, suddenly, there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed to be dark and locked, but a beautiful day, that kind of luminosity appears that opens the horizon and makes you believe in the fulfillment of your dreams. There was no one at her side, but suddenly she found a mate, out of nowhere, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life. This person was Toni, a slutty girl who does not seem to have roots, just like herself. <br /> <br /> But the title of the movie is "Ghosts", and ghosts appear and disappear however they want, is there no way to retain them? Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by you, hiding from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts. She once lost her daughter in Berlin, who had apparently been stolen from her in a supermarket, in only one moment of inattention. Now time has passed and Françoise is back in Berlin, still looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina could be that child, after all she has the same ankle scar and the heart-shaped birthmark. between his shoulder blades that seems to prove his true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina adopts this idea, after all she is not only in the desperate need of a companion, she also yearns for a mother. But in the end she is empty-handed, Toni disappeared with a man, and her supposed mother turns out to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes Françoise's husband, and the statement could not be more disillusioned. Nina is just a "girl", an unnamed girl, there is no hope for any divine achievement. There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives. So in the end, we see Nina alone, about to walk the road that opened before her, to a future that seems without joy and uncertain.
