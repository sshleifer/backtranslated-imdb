"Scarface" has a major cult following so far, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It has also been widely criticized for being very tacky, unrefined, exaggerated and all bloated! These are people who compare Scarface to the godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, script, direction, etc.) Scarface is far behind 'The Godfather'. <br /> <br /> But it is also true, that Scarface has and some other gangster lack of films, is the crudity, the rough approach of the bad guys. The Latino gangsters in this film look far more threatening and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish mobsters of other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Good Fellows'. This is one of the main points of victory for Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been considered "sticky" by most critics! I've seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both films are very different from each other and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original on the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was criticized for being over-the-top and top in this movie. But what about considering that is precisely how the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who makes rash decisions and launches temper tantrums every minute! He's not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky and uneducated individual who does not really think much and gets irritated all the time! <br /> <br /> There's definitely a very eighteen-part feel in this movie. The soundtrack is all 80's! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push to the limit' and the instrumental title track. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautifully filmed sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene. , the success of Rebenga, the first encounter with Sosa and the visit of Tony to his mother. <br /> <br /> About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the furious Cuban refugee. He would have mentioned that he rather liked playing Tony Montana throughout his career. And it really seems like he's had a blast in all his scenes! One wonders what the "Scarface" without Pacino would look like. I just could not imagine anyone portraying Tony Montana and in all likelihood, the movie would not be as effective without it! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tony's friend, Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. The same goes for F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> So there are some glimpses in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is fit in her role. <br /> <br /> The director goes a little overboard during a specific part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would just say that this was the only small part that suffers from improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the funniest and one of the best gangster movies ever to come out. Enjoy for what it is: a raw portrait of the Drug Lords and their gangland!
