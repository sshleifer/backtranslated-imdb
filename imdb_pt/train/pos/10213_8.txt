This capricious movie had the misfortune to be released at the same time from the highly popular "Amelie", both having the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that came out of France in recent memory. <br /> <br /> The film deals with chance, as its title indicates in English. The French title refers to how butterflies' wings can create chaos over the Atlantic while they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something that can not be believed just by looking at these colorful insects. From the outset, the director interconnects all the characters you see in the movie and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine but in the context of the movie seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A chance meeting on the subway sets the tone for the movie. Irene, who is going to work, is invited by the woman sitting across from her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and begins to read her article. Irene, it looks like she's going to meet and meet her soul mate the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man sitting next to the woman tells him that he has the same date of birth as Irene. It looks like they're meant for each other from the start, but unfortunately they will not reconnect to the last frame of the movie. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to do until the end, but he shows that he has a presence and plays his part well. The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he seems to be a director with his heart in the right place and an ear for the way humans are connected.
