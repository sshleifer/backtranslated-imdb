Four words explain why this movie was made - "She Done Him Wrong". The enormous commercial success of this vehicle Mae West convinced the brass studio that the melodramas of the 90s were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a well-paced, well-written game that perfectly targets the personalities of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little more difficult to accept, but it is Fay Wray who steals the movie with her maiden in danger. With a strong director - as Walsh proves to be - Wray could be very sociable, and she is totally believable as the object of Raft and Beery's affection. <br /> <br /> Lots of atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten movie worthy of revival.
