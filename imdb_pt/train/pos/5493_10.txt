It is very rare for you to have an internal view of a media misunderstanding that was widely publicized as official "truth" and caught up with so many "news" agencies with their pants down. This film, in my view, deserves all the price that exists in journalism - it's objective (yes!), Courageous and a true "hole." He can do without comments, false scenes or questions of leadership - everyone, including Chavez, can also play the fool in his own words. The filmmakers "just" had to keep up with the events and keep their cameras rolling. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "How to get rid of a president and sell it as a victory for democracy." It is incredible that they have lost in the end - so far. As far as I know, the biggest TV station involved could only revoke its terrestrial license, they are still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I very much doubt that George W. or Barack Obama were so tolerant after a coup attempt. But then they need not worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that the fraud of "Ch√°vez supporters kill innocent civilians" was so willingly repeated all over the world reveals how inclined the so-called "free" (established) media really has become, or ever was, just more. An important lesson for anyone interested in what "really" happens in the world. The famous challenge of "objectivity" always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the dominant view or reveal unwanted facts that accuse "us" - has been true of the effects of the atomic bomb, the secret US history of spreading "democracy" around the world or the Iraq war that, according to Johns Hopkins, has killed 1.3 million Iraqis, not to mention the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned . To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the United States. And the US is ready and willing to be more harmful to the Iranians than it was. <br /> <br /> I am quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, whether there will be any mention of our "involvement" in supporting and training the Pol Pot fighters in the 1980s , when they were largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not. <br /> <br /> One more reason to turn to independent media for balance, if not exposure to fraud.
