"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys are transported back to feudal Japan, hit by civil war for no particular reason, and much carnage happens. It's a bit more than the first sword-to-machine gun trial that ultimately produces some interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot essentially runs along the tracks you can expect from the title; The first fish-out-of-water antics ("what's this flying metal box?" Etc etc), "we're no better here" discussions and ultimately a huge battle. The latter is proof that the film is not taken seriously, the carnage occupying most of the second half while the samurai army faces the Chiba squad; a face that one would expect from the title, but still manages to overload with his creativity and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most original battle sequences of its time and does not creep despite its length. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives a rude performance like Iba, initially a good leader, but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him. This is certainly one of your best vehicles for your great resume. In the final act, both worlds had such an effect on each other, and you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, since they seem to be asking "were not we better then?" But that is perhaps reading a lot a lot in general can be described as an extremely entertaining two hours of action (almost) non-stop.
