A whole, this movie is not perfect. It does not "look good" together, since the plot is basically a bunch of hangers to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit "too much 80's" and tend to date the movie. <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know a movie has something special when you and your friends still make silly quotes from it two decades later. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a lot of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., Skipper of Gilligan Island. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some great absurd moments, like when Johnny is labeling the puppies with a price weapon, or the pope making an appearance in Johnny's neighborhood. Moreover, the scene in which the false priest makes many Latin words is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is very louder ... Meridian post, meridian ante, meridian uncle"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney massacring the English language Danny Devito asking Griffin Dunne for 'Play Ball' Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood The false movie VD <br /> <br /> This movie is not home run . But like "Porky's", it has enough classic comedy to make it memorable.
