This is a truly classic movie in its history, acting and film presentation. Wonderful actors are filled throughout the film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart being the main characters. In real life, she admired and liked Jimmy, and in fact gave him her first basics roles, and helped him calm down with his appearance on set. The "chemistry" between the two was always apparent and so warm and pleasant to see. She was a beautiful young woman and so sweet in her personality portraits. The story of these two young people, and how they finally come together at the end, is delightful to watch, and pure magical entertainment. Heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this wonderful story / film. I sincerely give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Era Film Classic, which has a special appeal to all generations. A must see for everyone!
