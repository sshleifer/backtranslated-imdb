There are plenty of sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and social means. Not to diminish films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to have just another approach and shed some light on the subject. <br /> <br /> The setting is the 2006 game between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. The passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to enter the match. <br /> <br /> The women who were caught (accused by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) were arrested on prosecution and provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country, most likely, of all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who were protecting and transporting them, both the city and the villagers, and the father looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> It's mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save its women from the gross behavior of its men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny women privileges and rights. <br /> <br /> Seeing the changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it is no surprise that this film will not have any Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner in his hands for those who can see him .
