This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and direct writing, which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day-to-day life. What we see is a slice of young Ruby's life. Ashley Judd (sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live by herself and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boyfriends, sex, a typical quest for young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose the film because of Sundance. I appreciate that kind of movie because it does not carry Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminded me of "No Fool," staring at Paul Newman. The later film is a slice of the everyday life of an ordinary man. I like it. The story is very well told, and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I am sure there are not many insects and flies in paradise like in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, I think of all of Florida. I turn into a full red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking on the beach in Panama City, Florida. In fact, the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite Quotes: "The need has always been a good excuse." "All this confusion in finding a man is no different now, who will be and when and why." <br /> <br />
