Fascinating about a pretentious male prostitute in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled criminal. An extremely somber examination of the moral and social decline of modern days, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who never surpassed his work here) and superbly represented by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. It makes a big impact, but the "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played for a laugh - are slightly intrusive, as is the "mod" drug feast. The relationship between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are careful not to get pissed off, and this gives the image an advantage it might not have had with a smaller director than Schlesinger. Originally censored in 1969, and won the Oscar for Best Picture; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book by James Leo Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 of ****
