Since it was done on a low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to get the most out of your budget with surprisingly good work on special effects. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family that is about to move to their solar home. - home fed in a secluded part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it destroyed - by motorcycle vandals, they think. But her youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light of a triple blast of stars has made extremely unusual auroras appear in the desert skies. So the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, comes face to face with strange alien forces that have put them in a distortion of time and space. Mixing elements from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEMENT AND NEXT FINDINGS OF THE THIRD KIND, THE FINAL TIME DAY, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to David Allen's excellent special effects work. The desert scenery is very appropriate for the forthcoming encounters of this film; and while the film can not really be compared to the Kubrick or Spielberg movies, THE DAY TIME ENDED is way better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller, KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS, made an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least trying - and based on that, I give DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10.
