Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this fun and funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has an entire section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames them both. The two now need to clear their names before it's too late. You'll laugh out loud like I did.
