I have to be 100% honest with your fellow IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a long time just because of the poster. Charlotte Gainsbourg does not seem extremely sexy and charming smiling like that? I'm in love with this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This movie should provide expectations for those who enjoy all sorts of romantic comedies or stories that involve intelligent humor and dramatic situations of light. <br /> <br /> Although I do not agree with another IMDb user who claims that the film is overrated; I must admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the lack of on-screen chemistry among the main characters. There is not a single pre-climax scene that shows the main characters sharing a "romance" moment or even a clue to suggest they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only scene they were both sharing a moment is tremendously strange (when both are on the couch) and does not help the public to understand about a possible love interest. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> Still, the film offers very funny moments and has strong dialogues that support such a naive premise. I mean, naive that it would be very difficult to perform such a thing for a man of 43 years these days. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept this as a funny situation. In addition, humor is versatile. There are times involving S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations involving women in the family, and more. <br /> <br /> The performance of Charlotte Gaionsbourg is top notch and she is by far the reason to watch movie. She is funny, sexy, looks very thin and well, and demonstrates that she is a versatile and talented actress who can take a comic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a great actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the support cast does what it can. <br /> <br /> The track, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give the film a dynamic look. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be satisfied after the final credits. It is a good example of feeling good in the movies.
