Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but do not worry - lead is a terrible shot), can be best described as a violent joke through Hong Kong and Cambodia.

I rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
