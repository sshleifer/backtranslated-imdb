I will say this to begin with: ... Why, oh, why can not WB do what these short film directors do? Sandy is obviously an incredible director and deserves some credit from WB and DC. But I think they're on the edge when a man with a budget of $ 12,000 can make a superhero fan drool. World's Finest is one of the best shorts I've ever seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a cool choice. Let's face it, Superman is not supermodel. He may be handsome, but he is not a GQ Stud. And I do not know what that guy did some comments above me, but Superman is really quite corpulent (have you ever read a Superman comic?). I think only the fact only touches me ... It seems such an obvious choice to get someone with real muscle mass to play a superhero instead of a pretty face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram is in incredible shape, and a great Batman ... I do not know guys ... If you have a bigger budget, and your own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be Neck and Neck . In short, this is just one of the few superhero movies with actors that actually play the role. <br/> <br/> The act is pretty cool too. I do not know what everyone is talking about, O'Hearn is not that bad. He's very convincing as Superman and Bartram ... Well, he's Batman. I mean, come on guys, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000, what did you expect? Everyone Else is also great except that Two-Face looks a little crazier than normal ... But, hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois is very hot too. <br /> <br /> SFX is also being sweet. I mean, watch Superman get the car up ... MAN! That's Cool. Versus the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I may have to put it above that, since Mike really seems to be flying, and with ease. The Flying sequences left something to be desired, but again, with a bigger budget ... Oh, and he even used a Batmobile! (Probably a Model, but it sounded damn convincing.) <br /> <br /> All in all, the only downfall of this trailer was the lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible Director, and NEEDS to break away from some kind of a project ... But no, they (like most Marvel projects) continue to get these hacking directors who show almost no consideration. for fans and what they care about, and continue to produce these game movies. Thank goodness Superman Returns was a success, or seriously would be the end. World's Finest is great and, in my book, counts as a superhero movie.
