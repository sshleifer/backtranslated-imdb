Now I know that French prisoners probably did not read Lovecraft (and this proves my argument that their writings should be taught in school, perhaps as a separate subject), but how they thought that something that sounds like "ftagn yog sototh" could The movie takes place in a prison where four unlikely colleagues are faced with a magical book that can, if read correctly, remove them. As prisons go, the cell was totally unrealistic, so it made it difficult for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves very slowly, which can annoy people. But in addition, this is a first-rate horror feeling, mixing Sartre's "hell of others" with a Lovecraft / Barker story type, and making it quite a hit. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: take the time to watch this. That means not doing this when you are about to go to work or sleep or while doing something else. This is a movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons to be learned: Yoga is bad, almost as bad as French women.
