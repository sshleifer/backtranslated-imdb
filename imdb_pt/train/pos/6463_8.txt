This is one of those movies you think about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that hot and confusing feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we feed on the typical stereotypes of characters and stories, but it does the trick: Have fun. <BR> <BR> Being from Sweden and living in the US for a long time, it's funny how we react. "The deadbeat husband is going to kill him," "She (Gabriella) is going to die and then there will be a breathtaking end to life." We know how these things work, everything comes together in the end. And it happened. The characters were rather simple, they were so elaborate that you did not think twice about it, nothing was left to your own imagination. The closest probably would be Siv, it makes you wonder if she really was in love with Daniel, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, set in the Norrland countryside, the music is absolutely incredible. and the characters are kind. Michael Nyqvist is truly genial with his unique crazy look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe a little too good. <br /> <br /> But above all, this movie makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. I do not know about you, but it does not happen that often.
