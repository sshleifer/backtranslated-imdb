The cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially in action: it is beyond any compliment. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the most brilliant symbol of Razrukha (Russian colloquial word for "devastation", often means the period of chaos of life style after the Civil War of 1918-20 ). opened the dirty door on the brick wall creaking in the snowy wind and the black hole of the door behind her. <br /> <br /> Now the film is released on DVD with the fully restored image and 5.1 sound, there are also well translated English subtitles, although some obscene words from Sharikov have been replaced by the more lenient versions of the translation. I do not know is that the DVD is available overseas, but if you find it to be immediate, it is really worth watching. <br /> <br /> And in conclusion, a fact: about 50% of Russians nowadays. , especially young people, can be identified as Sharikovs to a considerable degree. It is the post-Soviet effect: the Soviets seemed to be totally unprepared for the informational onslaught of Western civilization, TV producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media incredibly aggressive, soulless and unthought, in order to stimulate the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, every third party uses obscene language in forums and chats because it is incredibly common in colloquial speech.
