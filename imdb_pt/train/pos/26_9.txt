When I was a kid I watched this many times, and I remember whistling the song "Happy Cat" quite often. All of the songs are great and actually memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are simply stuck for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are luxurious, and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very feline and does not need stupid makeup, nor a cat costume for the viewer to believe that he is a cat transformed into a human. And Jason Connery is so cute, like the son of the timid and awkward miller Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and brave Princess Vera. This is a very fun and enjoyable movie where, unlike most fairy tales, the characters are given personalities. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Corin pretend he's drowning; at the dance when everyone starts dancing a country dance, like "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dancing at the table (he is also a great dancer); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she used to do when she was young, how to pretend she was the daughter of a miller. I recommend this movie for children and parents, who love magic and fairy tales. And, in fact, it's a movie you can watch together, since it will not take the adults to the wall.
