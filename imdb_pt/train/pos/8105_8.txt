SYNOPSIS The future seen since 1939 in England. As war has pervaded Europe, the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes. <br /> <br /> VIDEO CONCEPT Beware of your leaders and what you are told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a better future. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS AND CONS I've seen this movie a long time and recently downloaded it from the internet (it's in public domain). This is a fascinating work on several levels. Since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is both terrifying and capricious. This movie was cutting-edge for your day. The special effects are very good, just like the plot. The performance suffers somewhat in the British theatrical sense, in that it can lean a little for Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. The films show that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The fundamentals of almost all subsequent science fiction films can be seen in this film. The set and costumes for "Forbidden Planet," the failures of technology in "2001: A Space Odessy," to the lush landscapes / landscapes of "Star Wars" should inspire this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie leaves the viewer a little perplexed. Although optimistic in its ultimate sequence of reaching the stars, we wonder if mankind will survive. Even when we arrive, there are those who are trying to stop us. This cinematographic vision of the future, though interesting, is also somewhat humorous by today's standards. Huge flying machines and weapons that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are in this movie as young people. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their oratorical skills are evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the main character, Cabel. His character almost appears as the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of film history whose themes are still relevant today, even if vision of the future missed the mark.
