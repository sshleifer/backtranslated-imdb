This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was a classic of Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows the story. Scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagne pot in his basement as he crosses the city and tries to find a body for her by checking the local puppies. Finally he finds a real hourglass body with the head of a girl with a scar face on top. The severed head befriends the failed experiment in the closet, and the cone head leaves the cabinet and rips out the remaining "good" arm of the assistant (the other is not right due to a scientist's previous failure), and the whole place It burns. <br /> <br /> The movie scared us as much as the kids that my friend would not go to his basement for a year after seeing him. As children, we rated the scariest movies of all time and this was number four. Only one of those horror movies was really good (the original "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie a seven note for the sheer amount of entertainment value it delivers. Its mysterious effect because of the bad production and the strange sexual angle when the scientist searches for bodies (complete with pornographic soundtrack) scares innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make the material exquisite to watch talking and laughing. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I'd rather go to the dentist than watch "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven is the most I can give, because its entertainment value is mere luck. The movie, like cinema, is a disaster.
