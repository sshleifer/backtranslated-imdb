This film explores the difficulties that overwhelm hopes, dreams, love and friendship, and incorporates the mood wonderfully. Along with an impressive cast and brilliant footage, the soundtrack enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and climate of this work of art. All actors and actresses perform extremely well, exceeding expectation in every way. Parminder Nagra is brought to the big screen for the first time in this movie, and she is exceptional, capturing the vivacity and vitality that this movie is all about. Keira Knightly also works well with her co-stars, and this is her best work so far. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a brilliant movie, and that everyone should make the effort to see it at least once.
