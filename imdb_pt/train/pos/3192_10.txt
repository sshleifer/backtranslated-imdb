Yes, that gets the ten full stars. It's clear as the day when this fill is great. The universe sent Trent Harris a wonderfully strange young man one day and Harris picked him up on tape, in all the true misfit glory that you just can not fake. Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that guy's story. The other two steps of the trilogy recount the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young, respectively. The world is expanded and the strangeness is contextualized by recounting, giving us a broader glimpse of the strange growth in vanilla America. Recommended for everyone!
