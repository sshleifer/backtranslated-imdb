This is a movie called 'feel good', however, it made me sad in a way. Because? Because I had talent, but my parents did not let me study at the sports academy, and also the fact that at age 12 I decided to stop playing football. <br /> <br /> And football is the red line in this movie. Together with the struggle that young people have with the expectations that parents have. An Anglo-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the English family with a daughter who dresses like a boy and plays soccer ... a combination that worries his mother! This film also shows the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams, and living your life (where we've heard it before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful woman!) plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and things typical of 17-year-old girls. In contradiction to his sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> It is a real need to see how a beautiful young girl struggles with the traditions of her parents and ends up finding her luck. With good music by Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C as well as Indian hit songs. <br /> <br /> Nice to watch, but if you, like me, have ever played football, and never made it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
