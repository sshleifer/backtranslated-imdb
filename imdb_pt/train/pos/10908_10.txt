I could not hold back the tears when I watched this beautiful documentary. It was heart-breaking, disturbing and inspiring, all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone looking for something that makes them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or simply, something that will make you think. You watch as John lives in the last two months of his life. You watch as he spends his days with a positive attitude. At one point you get to see that he is truly an incredible individual. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. Your life and your struggles will make you cry, laugh and discover that life is much easier to live if you accept it only one day at a time.
