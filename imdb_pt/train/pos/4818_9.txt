I always have a bit of mistrust before watching the British films because I usually find them insipid and boring scripts (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a magnificent production design, landscapes and those thick British accents that make the cinema suggest artistic value they do not really have. Fortunately, the excellent film The Young Victoria does not fit into this situation, and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating history, the outstanding performances of Emily Blunt , Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and the costumes and locations that unexpectedly make the movie quite rich in sight. And I say "unexpectedly" because I do not usually pay much attention to those details. <br /> <br /> "Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points of contemporary civilization, not only in the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural aspects. But I honestly did not know much about the origins of that time, and perhaps because of that I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that so prepared the landing of the modern era. I also liked the way Queen Victoria is portrayed, who is like a young and intelligent monarch, whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions. I also found the representation of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because he is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the evocative emotions. The only flaw I found in this film is that screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some romantic movie clich√©s about the love story, something that seems a bit out of place in your script. I really liked The Young Victoria, and I really had a really good surprise with him. I hope more vintage films follow the example of this film: costumes and landscapes should work like the movie. support of an interesting story, and not as the replacement of it.
