This has just been broadcast by the BBC and I am absolutely glad to have seen it. As the credits rolled, the cast just made certain that I would give it a try. After only five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was stereotyped and predictable, but somehow added to its charm. The flashbacks of the forties were beautifully placed and captured an equal feeling in few productions. <br /> <br /> A true feel-good movie, punctuated everywhere with great music. When it's released, I'll buy it!
