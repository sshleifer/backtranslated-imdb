Marion Davies starred in this remarkable comedy "Show People," released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a country girl from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy they arrive at is a hoot-as Davies is scandalous southern suit. Davies gets a job in the slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but brings her success. She meets colleague William Haines, who is immediately in love with her. Well, Davies then gets a job in a high-profile studio ("High Art Studios") and gets a job in muffled period pieces. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows him the ropes of how to be the pretentious typical Hollywood star. Davies abandons his friend and baker for the good life, but of course he learns that he is not who she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful everywhere, as she - outrageously - runs the range of emotions required of a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comedian, and there are special guest appearances by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day, including the film's director, King Vidor. This is a silent movie with some "sound effects", since the sound images were appearing. A treasure from a movie.
