I came to be one of the best political satires I've seen so far, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent batch, very well placed and very good unexpected twist in the end. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> On the whole I give this movie a big thumb up. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East, and as such may receive poor criticism from people who do not share the same political vision, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate dark and gloomy humor. In fact, in some places, comedy was so close to the truth that it was the boundary between the funny and the tragic.
