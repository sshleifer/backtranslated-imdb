If you are in the mood for fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started very well ... but it is Govinda who steals the show from his hands ... incredible timing and good dialogue delivery ..... is inspired by Bad boys ... but has Indian Masala for him. .. people think it can be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is driving and Govinda is acting ... should not raise any doubt ... other films recommended in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo ) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Sahaan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi does not. 1, Hero no.1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
