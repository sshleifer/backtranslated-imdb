Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I think I'll start with the plot. A promised woman (Lucy) arrives at her family's home (Mathurin) in France, where they are awaiting the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will). waiting, young Lucy learns about a legend of a Beast that wandered through the gardens centuries before. In bed that night, she begins to fantasize about the Beast and her consensual meeting with the former mistress of the house. That's where it gets interesting! The plot is actually quite thin (and seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the movie), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who stand out with a shocking and hilarious ending. <br /> /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great movie theater, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie about bestiality (which almost casts a sympathetic look on the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it. Out of some horse-on-horse action in the beginning, the 'actions' are well caricatured, IMO)
