As a Bolton native, this film has an obvious appeal to me. The positioning is fascinating and shows a long transition Bolton - there are several scenes of apparent neglect but this serves to show the city that is being rebuilt - and the idea that the old has to make way for the new is right in the heart of this movie. A slightly battered James Mason conducts a nice set in a story about a fuss about a herring that spirals into a complete generational conflict then a pleasantly schmaltzy resolution. Although I'm a little too young to remember that completely, the minutiae of Lancashire's life in the 60's are all here: enjoying a Friday, songs around the piano, constitutional Sunday, good neighborhood, dating flurries, massive importance of self-respect, and I was glad to see the funniest lines of Naughton's play intact. There is no doubt that this film should be made available on DVD - it is well crafted and most of the performances are well performed.
