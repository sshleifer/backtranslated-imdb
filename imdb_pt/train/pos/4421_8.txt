The Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, bringing directors, editors and photographers very creative and working on historical themes, what the Japanese call "period pieces." The Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant indeed. The new wave of Japanese samurai films provides a glimpse into the traditional beliefs of shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture but not explored in Kurosawa samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would put director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other recent pieces from the Japanese period that I recommend include Twilight Samurai of Yomada (2002) and Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003), by Shintaro Katsu.
