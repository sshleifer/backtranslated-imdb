While the story is sweet, and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film is a joy, the film's uniqueness (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the sequel to dreams. It features the combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the engaging beauty of French Impressionist art, Kelly's fascinating choreography (including her sweeping "pas de deux d'amour" with a more distinguished genre), with the most magnificent color palette ever designed for the whole. Combining music and visual explosion with these dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.
