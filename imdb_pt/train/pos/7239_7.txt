What a gem of a movie, so good that they did a sequel. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off really well with a nasty monster that eats some people and a party where the two main characters first saw each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, a bit of an idea of ​​who this character is, who moved to the city and uses the services of a real estate agent to find a home for him. Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The film is watchable, but the actors' performances are pretty wooden and they do not seem to want to be in this movie, but it might all be part of the decadent environment. <br /> <br /> He did not like the ending, but there is a sequel, must track him. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes did not really fit the part. Later, I could not stop thinking about him, he kind of exudes a strange sensuality, so maybe he was right for the role. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler - the rise of evil' as Lieutenant Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
