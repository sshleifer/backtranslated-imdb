This is by far one of the best movies made and did not leave me disappointed at all. The soundtrack, along with the finely shot handheld work, was excellent. There is always a chance that one film does not bring beliefs, just like another, but I felt that the timing of that image and the timing were excellent. Dakota Fanning is fast becoming a milestone in the movie that demands a child with an old soul personality and she has never let me down with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, both overcome the challenge of showing the darker sides of humanity trying to move into the light.
