Incredibly, Gojoe is a samurai action movie inspired by anime and Hong Kong with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great acting job done by Daisuke Ryu), a murderous monk who has turned into bodega-monk, Benkei. Benkei vowed never to kill again, but he still grabs the sword to fight what he thinks is a demonic invasion ... Gojoe is a difficult movie to gauge. His visuals are amazingly crafted and beautiful, but they use many tricks (circular camera and high-speed drives, expressionist shots, colored colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is a bit tiring. That said, the beginning and end of the film are, however, elegant and powerful. If only director Sogo Ishii had been wise enough not to abuse his bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such a violent message, Gojoe wastes energy and screen time to describe the endless battle scenes. Moreover, the way violence is shown is always on the verge of being self-indulgent; in fact, a bloodbath against the night sky seems to be one of the signature images of the films. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly and tragic side of violence as well. Still, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he's making a traditional action movie or a deeply moral allegory. Nor can the public be sure of that until the end of the film. The powerful (though cynical) ending is what saves the Gojoe; He clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a simple bash.
