One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking about the extra story that this movie adds. Almost 40 years old, I saw this with my wife and two kids after work tonight and I did not laugh and I really enjoyed a movie in a long time. <br /> <br /> Take time out and watch this with the kids. It will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were young.
