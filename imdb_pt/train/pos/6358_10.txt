I love this movie, but I can not understand what's in this movie that is not to like. People who do not like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe it's Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And I'm sure most of the movie's actors and actresses made the film before that. And there's a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. When it opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And it causes some fun for whos in Whoville. Sicne know that those who love Christmas. While the Grinch does not like Christmas. And even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the city's postal agent (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as the Mayor of Whoville. Who does not like to talk about the Grinch near Christmas?
