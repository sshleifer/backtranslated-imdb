This is a great movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I am not the only one who shed a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, she made the sincere and memorable end. In the hands of a minor actress, her last scene would have seemed banal and tacky. No one would have imagined that this movie was made on a tight and limited budget. The cinematography is beautiful and there are several actors of great name. The script is so wonderful, I can see why they all wanted to be in it. If you watch the long and long list of credits at the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii came to make this movie happen and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the movie. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the movie to end.
