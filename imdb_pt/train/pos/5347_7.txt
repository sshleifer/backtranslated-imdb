Another Spanish film about the Civil War of 1936. This time, we are told about the story of Carol (adorable played by debutante Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village in New York. It is a journey so initializing, and she will soon discover the injustices of the human race, their struggles and stupid conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photograph and a good script. He tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and lets us decide (okay, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide which band we are in) and he takes a huge advantage of the young couple's presence and freshness starring: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-kept production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
