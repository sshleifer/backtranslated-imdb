Story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most balanced of the group - but wants to leave her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than the rest of them. <br /> <br /> This is not news of what we have seen many times before - but this one has a big difference - it is necessary. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and was amazed at how realistic it was. They left the dialogue, clothes and attitudes completely wrong. Even the main song of the film ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a big hit before leaving. This movie hit me more than any other teen movie of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I met girls in high school who were like this! The film is (of course) dated, but it captures a time we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The acting is good in all aspects, with Foster giving the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well made. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) played more or less realistically a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - an essential vision if you mature in the 1980's. Film has a deserved R rating (plenty of drug use and profanity) but should be seen by all teenagers. I give an 8.
