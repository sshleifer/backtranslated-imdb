Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their own land, are deceived into being involuntary pedestrians of Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time is their story, the characters they encounter and their struggle to get things right. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting for some of the best in the business, this eccentric movie hits the mark. <br /> <br /> The process of animation, although similar to the "South Park" style cropped. , is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I did not know that the animation was of that style, I would swear it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, please do! You really will not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get much more from the experience!
