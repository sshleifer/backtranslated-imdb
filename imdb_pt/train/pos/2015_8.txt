This may not be one of the best movies ever made, but overall it's a very nice and joyful piece of foam in which everyone involved seems to be enjoying themselves. Highly recommended for the feeling factor alone. OK, so Frank Sinatra's performance leaves a lot to be desired, but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra went on to make many other films, where his ability to perform indubitably shone, but in this, his first venture in Hollywood, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this film. I just watched it again on TV and it still raises my mood as much as the first time I saw it many years ago.
