It's not always easy to explain what a movie looks like, but this time I think I've found it. That reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small crooks doing some drugs and doing stupid things at Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). <br /> <br /> It is about loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of prison, the other has not yet caught. With a stolen vehicle, they drive through the Scottish countryside, but run out of fuel. While trying to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to steal it and points a gun at one of them. Than everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of Schotland. The two friends literally have to run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently this movie was filmed in just 12 days. OK, this is not exactly unbelievable because most of it is always in the same place: the Scottish interior, but I still find it incredible. Especially because this is not really a bad movie. It may not be the best movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they've achieved. I had a good time watching and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.
