The story deals with Jet Li who has to fight against his old friends. But there is a problem, friends are superfighters. The film is full of blood, super action and the best maneuvers forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Of course the movie has the typical HK-Fun.But I love it! In Germany, "Black Mask" is uncut.
