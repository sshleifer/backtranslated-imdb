TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best film of all the films of Mary Pickford. At two o'clock, it was quite long for a silent film of 1922, but it continues to hold its interest about 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her best performances, sometimes the role looks like a performance of "big hits" with pieces of Mary, the innocent, Mary, the devil, Mary, the mother, Mary, the witty, Mary, the romantic heroine, etc. were used over a single film in the past. The film is surprisingly frank about the illegitimate child of a supporting character for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is considered the single mother in question! If the Oscar had been around 1922, no doubt the Oscar for Best Actress for the year would have been for Maria.
