This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films of the subgenre. It is produced by Roger Corman, who at this time had produced some WIPs. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. The film takes place in a US prison, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if it was a smart move, but it's an acceptable pace change. Demme really comes into her work, always looking for new ways to present a familiar setting. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates some surreal dream sequences that are pretentious, but it's fun to see how much he tries to put that movie above his girlfriend-in-chains movie. But do not worry, Demme still operates within the parameters of the subgenus. There is a lot of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a bit slow, but it's a lot of fun. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran so she does not need a presentation, and Barbara Steel is a hoot like the crazy wheelchair director. Pam Grier is really missing, however.
