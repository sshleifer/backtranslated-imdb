Here's proof of why Mary Pickford was America's Sweetheart. In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the young daughter of an invader who dares to dream of a son from one of the "tops of the hills." The scenes in which they steal a kiss and fall in love are simply delicious. She's even willing to take a shower. That Mary could remove this role at the age of 30 is simply incredible and somewhat due to her diminutive stature (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges. She does so with courage not seen in many heroes of the day. Tess takes a hit and is not ashamed to fight anyone. Because she agrees to help the hilltop daughter besides me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's closes are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The Danish Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain. The scene in which he handles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or whatever) on the movie screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) had worn a beard, would it have been a combination for the model used on the Uncle Sam World War I recruiting posters? Wants You! <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit predictable and slow in the beginning, it pays to invest in its time to see the piece or pure Americana. 'The film highlights choices available to all of us, involving making someone happy and what it's like to be a true Christian. Recommended.
