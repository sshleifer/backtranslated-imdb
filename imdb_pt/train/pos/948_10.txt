This is simply one of the best interpretations of Dicken's classic tale. The script follows very accurately the story originally written by Dickens and captures a perfect balance between a movie atmosphere and a game atmosphere. Viewers who enjoy both formats will find enough of the story based on their presentation style of choice. George C. Scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to Scrooge's character, and is very convincing in the development of the character instigated by ghost visits. I discovered that he was able to convince me to the point where I sympathized with the old miser, something that rarely happened in other versions. The excellent work done by the supporting actors contributes a lot to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all versions of Christmas Carol I have seen.
