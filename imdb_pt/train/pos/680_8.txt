"The Last Wave" is one of those films that rely heavily on the mind. The title refers to the theory of the aboriginal doomsday: there will be one last wave that says it all. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a lawyer from Sydney hired to defend some Aborigines accused of murder. Around that time there were heavy rains in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the latest wave theory and begins to wonder if it's just mythology. <br /> <br /> The last sequence of the film is a metaphor for descending into the depths of the mind. Peter Weir created a bewildering, but instigating film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in "Walkabout," "Crocodile Dundee," and "Rabbit-Proofing Fence") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the accused. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watch the making of feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the film's tones, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's past.
