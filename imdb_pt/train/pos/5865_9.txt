I saw this on the cable back in the early 90's and I loved it. I've never seen it again until it appeared on the cable again recently. I still think it's a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why it is not higher rated. I found everything about this movie convincing. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), I can relate to the situations brought by Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this movie being more poignant now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this was offered on cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers is not left on the battlefield. Your brought home for the rest of there lives. And this movie is one of the many that brings this house in a very difficult way. Great movie.
