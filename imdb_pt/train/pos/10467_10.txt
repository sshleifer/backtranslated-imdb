But unfortunately, due to rights issues, this will almost certainly never happen. Transcripts of Joe Bob's commentary on the sub B movies he exhibited are available on the internet, but they do not capture his twang well, which was a real hoot. Nowadays, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is limited to making the complementary features of classics like "I spit in his grave" (with what some exploration fans call the movie rape of all time) and Jason X, one of the most hated Friday the 13th sequences of all time (the series was never the same when it came out of Paramount). All I could think of when they canceled was, "Damn, where else am I going to get full of flesh, blond pranks and horror trivia every Saturday night? Does that mean I have to have a life now?" Unfortunately, this happens. But there will always be a place in my heart hungry for "Monstervision". Long live the drive-in!
