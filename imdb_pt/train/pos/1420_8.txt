In commemoration of Earth Day, Disney released the movie "Terra". Stopping too far from any strident message of sadness and disgrace, we are treated with some excellent images of animals in their habitats, without feeling very bad about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and proceeds southward until we reach the tropics, at the same time as it is presented to the inhabitants of the various climatic zones crossed. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned while observing the wanderings of polar regions. Bear; note is made of shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years. We never see the bears catch the seals, but their father's desperate search for food leads to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> Aerial shots of the caribou migrating through the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife photos I have ever seen. Saw; he and other wild migratory birds are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that photos of large white sharks taking stamps were filmed in slow motion. You never notice a feature of wild animals; its incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie to convey great speed I think it started with (or at least is the first I remember watching) the television program "Kung Fu" during the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this film to make it a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective editing (sparing us, so to speak, of the horrible end of a predatory prey moment) and the fact that this footage was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it's a solid movie by itself only. . And you can take your kids! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
