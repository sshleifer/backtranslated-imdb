There are movies and movies. Films are most often just cinematic "sweets," while movies are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well placed in the second. Like most viewers, I was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the central character's portrait is what I consider to be the most excellent quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Germany, at the same time as the dependence on morphine, Die Fraulein is treated with much contempt by the German high command, despite all his efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is being driven into the backseat of a Mercedes Benz car, alone, desolate and sobbing, is perhaps one of the saddest and true depictions of the life of a "spy". Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in Spy Who Came from the Cold comes close. Fraulein Doktor is a much deeper film than one can imagine in a singular vision. I just wish its producers could release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it could, and those who saw it can again (maybe again and again) enjoy this exceptional movie.
