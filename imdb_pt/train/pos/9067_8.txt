After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". For the first time, I did not find the end! It was funny and funny and it did not appeal to a ton of rude humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both LOVED them too - oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is not only tolerable for parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He does not stop singing just to annoy me !!" In addition, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how these friendships really form is how the child behaves. Of course, parents have to act a bit silly - but my favorite scenes involve the father getting used to his new job. Have fun!
