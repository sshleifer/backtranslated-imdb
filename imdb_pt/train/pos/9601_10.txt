Darius Goes West is an incredible documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends who take him on a trip across the country to see if "Pimp My Ride" will rearrange his wheelchair. <br /> <I recently watched this movie at the Sun Protection Film Festival. He played twice over the festival. This movie is an incredible story about the human spirit and spirit of Weem's friends. I do not say this often about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel motivated to do something for the sake of it. All the festivals in which this movie participated, this movie won some kind of award. He's at the Tribeca Film Festival, and goes to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie went to the Oscars. It's snowball out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, wherever it's playing, go! Take as many people as possible and go! He's going to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I hope that tickets for the Atlanta show will be sold quickly, if they are not already. Please go see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
