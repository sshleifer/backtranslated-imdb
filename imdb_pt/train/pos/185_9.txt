I finally bought it and added a copy of "Show People" to my collection. I can not comment more than the previous viewers claimed and the characters, plot and overall quality of this movie without repeating their own words. Seeing the apparition, the out-of-character appearances of so many silent M-G-M stars are worth the view alone. I really like the scene in which Marion Davies plays herself and finds herself playing the main character in the movie, Patricia Pepoire. Be sure to read her lips as there is no title card stating what she is saying when she sees Marion Davies, but it is something to the effect of "I do not think I like her!" Pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in the history of cinema. Appreciate!
