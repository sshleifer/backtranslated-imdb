Stephen King was raised in movies like that. They are not movies. <br /> <br /> Movies like this and 'Jeepers Creepers' are 'reminiscences' for the good old horror movie. They are made to be fun, cheap and hopeful: some good scares. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is looking for a theory about the human condition should pass on this feature of creature, because that is all ... everything will never be. <br /> <br /> Stop destroying what was once considered junk. -Good, fun, trash! <br /> <br /> If you liked this I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers' 'Jeepers Creepers 2' '30 Days of Night' 'Scarecrows' ('88) 'They live' 'Planet Terror' 'Death Proof' 'Halloween III: Witch Season'
