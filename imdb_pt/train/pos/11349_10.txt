This movie may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for TV, but it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film and its actors have won several awards. It is engaging, fascinating and will absorb you completely. The story of a chase by a killer on an iron curtain in Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction - but it is ostensibly a true story. I recommend.
