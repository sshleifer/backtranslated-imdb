It amazes me how much I love this movie although I do not like dogs very much. Fox, Field and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the acting of the animals themselves is incredible. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times (I know this sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the final scenes still catch me. I recommend it for people of all ages and especially for animal lovers. It is indeed my favorite movie of all time!
