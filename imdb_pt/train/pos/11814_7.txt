Normally, when we use the word "escapist," we mean that it is negatively; The big-screen version of Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" proves that "escapist" might be good. This is truly a fun movie. As the homonym title character, yellow and fearless, Beatty creates a detective with whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without its weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world in itself. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the husband of any crime fighter to be; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most intriguing person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the common villain: ruthless, but cool. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), Speaking Challengers, The 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I did not even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to arrest Big Boy. Simultaneously, some very bizarre events have happened in the city, whose answers may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty was having trouble acting his age, then he made good use of it here. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
