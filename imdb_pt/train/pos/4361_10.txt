This was probably one of the best-made films of the 40's - Warner Bros., at the height of its style. Sol Polito's photography is undoubtedly his best accomplishment - beautiful compositions and lighting with delicate shadows. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classic leit motif method. The music adds a lot of excitement and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It's interesting to note that the same production crew who made this film went straight to making "Now, Voyager" later that year - a great movie that won honors and awards and fell as a historic favorite, categorically because it starred Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better film - better done in all departments and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A very unusual film that entertains those who accept it for what it is, instead of projecting their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection. Every thing has to be judged on its own temporal reference and on what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I read in these reviews are so childish and totally lacking in the point. If you are hungry for a perfect filet mignon, do not go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the puff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost in a large segment of the population. Sorry people - maybe if this movie had a Rolling Stones track and a hundred intricate and witty subplots, everyone would be happily satisfied. I'm going to take an old movie without any modern intellectual pretensions one day of the week!
