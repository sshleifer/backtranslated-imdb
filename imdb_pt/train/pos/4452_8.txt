Do not be influenced by pessimists. This is a wonderfully scary movie. This was a thesis project for writer / director, JT Petty. He did a great job of getting me to the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect, and for a horror movie goer, this is Nirvana! The film concerns an elderly man living in an isolated hut in the forest. One day, while looking for your cat in the forest, does he witness the murder of a child, or him? He agonizes over the rest of the film. What is most unusual about this movie is that there is no dialogue here until the last scenes. I found this intriguing. The writer gets hold of his senses and gives them a relentless tug. Give this movie a try, you will not be disappointed.
