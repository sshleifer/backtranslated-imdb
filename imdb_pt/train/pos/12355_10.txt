I can understand those who do not like this movie because of the lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> Firstly, these girls are not geishas, ​​but renters of brothels, and one who does not know the difference will not understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end. This is a complete art work about the lives and needs of women in this era. Everything is important and certainly the way they dress, throughout the film, means more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I will suggest you read a little about this society before coming to such a conclusion out of reality. This is Kurosawa's work of life, and I am sure that the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's play to the right intellectual reach.
