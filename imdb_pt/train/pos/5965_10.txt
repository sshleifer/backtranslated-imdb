I gave it 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child of the 80's and totally in heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons I love this movie so much. It's so cool to see these posters in that boy's room (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted's sister ...) and his collection of vinyls (revealing the perverse by Exciter, Rise of the Mutants by the master of shock metal Impaler and Killing is my business for Megadeth). Also the soundtrack of FASTWAY is totally amazing and fits very well with the plot. If you like metal, then TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for seconds, watch the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory of the 80s. You will not be the same person later.
