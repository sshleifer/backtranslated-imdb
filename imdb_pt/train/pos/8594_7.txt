The Sentinel I was hoping would be a good movie and boy I was right. A great first story of a novel and I thought this was an original story but I guess it was not and it was a very clever story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland too but it is very difficult to get him out of the role of Jack Bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in The Sentinel than in 24. also someone else trying to get rid of the TV role but could not.Eva Longeria.Ela was not so good in the movie and had a back seat throughout the thing.After I saw the movie I had constant dreams about the Sentry and could not sleep.Overall Sentinel It's a good movie and I would recommend it.
