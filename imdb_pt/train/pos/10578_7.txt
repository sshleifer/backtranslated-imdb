"Footlight Parade" is just one of several wonderfully joyful musicals that Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to ward off the Depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced during that time, and literally made millions of Americans forget their troubles for a while, and have fun. <br /> <br /> Although most of the films produced have Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell's great talents, only the Foolight Parade had the unparalleled James Cagney. Almost ten years before his best known musical, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances in the most original dance style, with his arms usually lowered to the side and his legs doing all kinds of ripples and kicks. It's easy to see that he's having fun, and that makes us enjoy it even more. <br /> <br /> While almost all musical sequences appear at the end of the film, they are worth waiting for. I believe this movie was made just before the installation of the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit spicy. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> No matter what the plot of the movie is, just know there are lots of laughs and a superlative cast. In addition to those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is much better here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
