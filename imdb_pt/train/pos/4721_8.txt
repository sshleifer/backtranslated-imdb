Sad story of a downed B-17 pilot. Brady is shot down in occupied territory. Local farmers offered goodness and protection at the cost of their own lives. I had never heard of this movie and it stopped me for two hours. After the movie is over, I'm glad I took the time. It's a whole story told to explain the look on Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
