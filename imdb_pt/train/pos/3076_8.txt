Why the Panic never had a good theatrical release is easily seen: it's very clever, and the audience probably would have had a hard time with it, comparing it to American Beauty in its middle-aged crisis, and Sopranos and Analyze This in its study of illegal activities in the midst of family life. Although Panic may seem to derive from non-original material, Brommel's real characters, along with skillful dialogues and observant direction, make the film a realistic look at the destruction of a middle-aged man. William H. Macy stars as Alex, a killer who works for his father's (Sutherland) contract killing business. He leads a double life with his wife (Ullman) and unconscious son of his true trade. In middle age, he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life. Under his calm, collective facade, the resentment repressed by his father's control over his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell) he feels invigorated and decides it's time to drop the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract murder is disposable. He could easily replace him with any unwanted profession; his characters are so well developed and believable, scenes treated so smoothly and realistically and dialogue written so perceptively and naturally that the focus falls on Macy's conflicting character rather than his work as a murderer. Brommel's script sounds like a tragedy of Shakespeare, with a definite theme of fate everywhere. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic character, easily sympathetic, and turns into another litter, great performance, as always expected. Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his domineering father, and Ullman's dramatic change as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where his mood subtly darkens and peaks in an emotional scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first feature, Panic, is a film that is well crafted in its sincerity. With a first-rate cast, plausible script, concise dialogue, and good direction, this character study is just a sample of Brommel's ability to create characters that look real. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
