Night Of The Living Homeless is a fun parody of the 1978 movie (and the remake of 2004) from "Dawn Of The Dead". Only this time ... with the homeless. The episode has homeless people coming to South Park and people can not figure out why. They treat the homeless as zombies who want to change and some of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie. So now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them. This is a rather funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the song 2pac / Dr.Dre "California Love". episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
