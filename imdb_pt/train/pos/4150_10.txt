I watch Cold Case because of the real-life experiences portrayed. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully treated, thank you, Merideth. All characters are well-developed 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to address, the US is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of portrayal and real and honest experiential treatment has an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I'm excited that 3/4 of the men interviewed in the crowd of less than 30 voted the same as I did 10. You're hitting the hardest - I'll always reserve the "best episode "place for this episode. Please continue to take risks and accept my sincere gratitude.
