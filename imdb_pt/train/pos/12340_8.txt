There is, in fact, much to complain about this film version of Molnar's mystical play - Farell seems to be good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, smell bad. This also suffers, in large part, with this being credited as the first film that makes use of the rear projection. The sets look fake. <br /> <br /> However, there are two major advantages to this program: while the dialog readings are poor, visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is scarcely remembered today: mainly by ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut the programmer EAST OF BORNEO for simple photos of her: credit to Melford's elegant visual direction. Its great beauty and simple (though dazzling) performance help repair some of the damage to the land parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the heavenly sections that make it great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'The Hot Spot'. H.B. Warner's performance here, as always, is perfect. <br /> <br /> So here we have a flawed but very interesting version. I think the 1934 version of Lang is better, as are the heavenly scenes in Henry King's version of CAROUSEL, the watery remake. But I still really enjoyed this version and I think you should give it a try.
