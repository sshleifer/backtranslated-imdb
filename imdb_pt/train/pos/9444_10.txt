*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packed with memorable moments (like the quote above, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild forests for rafting and stay away from the big city for a while only to find that your fun soon takes a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood movie. There is virtually no special effect, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing is just sweetened or made beautiful. The city boys look like city boys, and even tough Louis, accurately portrayed by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of wildlife on this trip. This is a perfect example of a what-if movie. What if some friends raided an area of ​​the jungle that none of them knew, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted of murders that were forced to commit to save their own lives? <BR> There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with the social and class structure and the relation (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four boys arrive in the woods early in the movie, they clearly do not know how to interact with the people who live outside, and talk to them as if they are not sure if they would understand or be able to communicate. This block of communication is most memorably illustrated in the scene of the duel banjos, in which they are trying to supply the car and the truck and get someone to drive the vehicles down the river for them. While Drew and the obviously inborn and probably mentally handicapped boy on the porch are dueling with his guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis is having some difficulty in buying gasoline, and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic he is all this. As the boy walks away from Drew, who offers to shake his hand after the stupendous jam session, Bobby tells him to give the boy some change, knowing none of them are sure how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing we see in Liberation that sets up a lot of the tension that follows. This great scene where a lot of fun has been lived (including the funniest scene from 'country runner' to The Brother, Where Are You?) He ended up with everyone awkwardly not knowing what to do around each other. These people are apples and oranges and live by completely different rules of life. The people Louis, Bobby, Drew, and Ed meet in the hills have grown apart from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include those you will not kill. Confused by the clumsy behavior, the four friends leave for the river, waiting for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the backwoods beside the river that quickly become unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way these people live - that was established by the above scene - enters the scene to create the greatest tension during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the movie, ie the actual robberies and murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time, but there remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. movie. There is no free violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a surprisingly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> The decision is about the violent confrontation of two very different types of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with one another. The journey through the rest of the river after the assault, which occupies most of the film, provides a dramatically effective tension, and keeps you at the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much that you become numb. It is surprisingly effective when we discover that Ed may well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film does not diminish as the three surviving team members reach the bottom of the river. , because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing movie which is a testament to its success because it is quite obvious that a movie like this is made to shake people up a bit. Countrymen are the humane (that is, more realistic) version of subhuman countrymen seen in children's movies, but quite similar, like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, and neither could be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men on their fateful weekend in the jungle, the natural element is so real and we know men so well and in such a subtle way that it's almost as if we as individuals in the audience actually fifth team member . It is not often that a movie is able to find that way.
