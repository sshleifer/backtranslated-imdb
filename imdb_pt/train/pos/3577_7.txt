This movie has probably never made a dot on the radar screen, but it has a bit of quality. It's very realistic, but you think "it's just a movie". Duvall and Close portray ordinary people, and you'd never realize they're big names now. It seems the idiot in this story is a little too old to be pursuing Eugene's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the boy would travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I think it is possible. You may think that the family problems in this movie would never happen in your own family, but I think it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like "You think the job you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
