Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. Successful, not to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has the view that he must kill a legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojoe Bridge to attain enlightenment. Although not in the vanguard, Buddhist thinking is at the center of this film, much like Kurosawa's "Ran." Probably what made the film the most interesting to me, despite being close to the "Ran" league. <br /> <br /> The elegant visual direction and the excellent photograph keep the film more interesting during the two hours and eighteen minutes of duration. The leading actors are uniformly excellent. The music is very good. The two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes. The movie trails in the middle that could have been corrected by some cautious editing. And the fight scenes are mostly shot in fuzzy close-ups. This works for most of the movie, but the end looks like a scam. Another recent movie like this is Tsui Hark's "Seven Spades", great movie, but the promised fight scenes are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a demon wielding the sword, his acting is great, but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fighting scene. <br /> <br /> Good movie, you'll probably find it interesting just do not expect traditional sword fights.
