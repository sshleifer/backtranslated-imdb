Great documentary about the life of NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time .. Just why this should be a collector's item should see .. What shocked me was not only the attacks, but the "High Fat Diet "and the physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think many physicians would agree with me that in the physical form they were, some of these firefighters could NOT get to the 79th floor carrying more than 60 pounds of equipment. Having said that I now have a greater respect for firefighters and realize that becoming a firefighter is a life-changing job. The French have a history of making great documentaries and that is what it is, a great documentary .....
