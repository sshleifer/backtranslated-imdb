I'm totally addicted to this show. I can not wait until the week pass to see the next exhibit. It's a great story and has the best actors and actresses in the show. I'll tune in every week to watch, even if I'm not at home, I always have my VCR to record monarch cove. Simon Rex is the best actor in the series. is suspenseful and exciting. I think this show should be on the air and I believe everyone should watch. I saw the first episode and actually I was not going to watch it but I was watching life one day and I decided to watch it because I was turned on and I absolutely love it and now it's my favorite show. I really am bad at this.
