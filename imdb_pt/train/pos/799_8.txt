he is the narcissist and manipulator par excellence; in this case, interpret lawyer (and murderer) Tom Capano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris is nice as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim. We were very sorry for the situation, but we were simultaneously disgusted after seeing the victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward) as well. <br /> <br /> The sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem. issues, and Capano actually had his psychologist killed. Very hard to believe, but this was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a tip with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as the mother of Capano. All in all, an interesting story, because it's based on a real murder, and you'll want to read Ann Rule's book for accurate details. 8/10
