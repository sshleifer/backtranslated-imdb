Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which one makes you smile every time you watch. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. It is caratherisic for Serbia. And the whole ancient republic of Yugoslavia knows very well !!! So I guess the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) may not like it that much. Because the legends spoil the hole thing. But they should at least try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best film in Serbian history and the world does not understand! :-) If you get the chance to see this, do not ruin it!
