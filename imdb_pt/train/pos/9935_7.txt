My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {TO EDIT. CUT. Reproduction} I've never seen a director take much notice of his style before. By now, it is clear that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's turbulent, flashy, and dazzling editing technique. If I have to choose between loving and hating, I'd say I love it. It was a distraction at times, but the end result was very good and it's good to see a director with a creative edge over his style and some originality (even if it's a lot borrowed from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic advantage manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of the arrogant bounty hunter and fucking Domino Harvey and even his dialogue seems strangely agitated. Otherwise, she misinterprets it because I hated her character and did not sympathize with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins fellow fellow Rewards Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew curls up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show deal under the TV producer Christopher Walken (what is Christopher Walken doing in all the movies, by the way?). I think it's a clever film technique because now Tony Scott is free to use the MTV / Reality Show editing stuff as he likes. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture on this point. <br /> <br /> It follows that the story is told at an incredibly fast pace with a lot of aggressive language and armed violence. There are some funny jokes; it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty nice mess. It's basically flawed in many ways (actors try hard to make their characters "cool", for example), but it works. I give you a weak 7/10 that may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of the movie goers who rated this movie? but I feel that he had some good ideas and executed them well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
