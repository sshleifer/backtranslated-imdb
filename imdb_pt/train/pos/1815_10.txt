"May Contain Spoilers" "All Dogs Go to Heaven" is a great movie. I saw this in 1989 when I was two years old. I do not get it so well but as I've seen it more and more times I've started to love it I love the songs from this movie My favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You Come Home" These are beautiful songs The only The thing that bothers me about the movie is Charlie dying. When I was little, my sister could not even see that part. Other than that, this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around. The paradise is beautiful in the movie and the "clocks" are very intelligent. I also love Itchy, actually I have 3 my dachshunds. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall I love this movie and I suggest everyone to see, I give this movie 10/10 stars.
