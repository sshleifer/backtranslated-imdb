Halloween is one of the best examples of independent films. It is very well done and has more psychological elements than you might realize at first glance. It's a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most amazing scores ... If you have not seen this movie, you need to check it out. The cast is all fantastic. I wish they had never done sequel after sequel. The first was by far the best and should have ended as it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not seem to grow old (she is so beautiful today, without her seventy-year-old clothes). Scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!
