I do not watch soap operas. My grandmother still watches the one with the hourglass. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie does parody and spells a new way. I found the story very funny. The 80's fashion - shoulder, sequin and polyester cushions - is just the maximum. Huge hair, high heels and histrionics - what a combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors go to the city, chewing their parts and spitting them into a large, well-scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had that potential, before the tabloids. And Garry: Why did we have to wait so long to see him at the movies? Leesa Gibbons - I was not missing her, but it's good to include her as a real-life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for THIS job, anyway?). <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have done without Sally up the sewer pipe. Lucy Ricardo did this, how many times? Like every Carol Burnett comedian, I do not know who and I'm so sick of it now, I could spit peanut if I had them. Apparently that's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful they did not get the mast off the flag. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, it had twists in the plot, had a post-credit ending before it was common, had clothes worth a second look, had a great cast and has personal memories for me. Really, what else do you need?
