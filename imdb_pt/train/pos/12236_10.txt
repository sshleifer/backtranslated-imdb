I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old in a drive-in movie theater with my family. <br /> <br /> At the time, I found it very funny. . . even being too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful film a delight! I saw it again this morning in "Turner South". As I watched, I was absolutely convulsed with laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic from a bygone age. If you're too young to have experienced the delightful period of history that produced this movie, I'm sorry for you. There is no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (to this day) deliver such a delightful piece of heaven to "veterans" as I do. <br /> <br /> That said, all I can do is Respectfully, ask the young people to refrain from commenting on films like "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of its people. And as such, these films speak a very different language than anyone can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words? If you do not understand the subjects that the film is addressing, please do not be ashamed by offering comments that ?? quite frankly? does not make sense.
