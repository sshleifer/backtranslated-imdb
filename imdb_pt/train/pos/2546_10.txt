That's pretty much the same as 'The Black Cat', though I'd give it a 9 instead of 9+. This is really a compliment to a movie that has been so underrated that it's amazing! <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is part horror, part drama and certainly part science fiction. For a film made in 1936, the elements of science fiction were far ahead of its time. The mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect blend, while the performance of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many elements that James Whale has done so many times. What I'm saying is that this movie is sinister and well filmed. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the weather. It is a moment of prominence in the film, which unfortunately is missing in the current films of the genre. <br /> <br /> As with 'The Black Cat' and 'Island of Lost Souls', I can not understand why the movie has not yet been released on DVD. When you consider that some of the junk that has already been transferred to the DVD is much more intriguing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you get the chance. When it's released on DVD, grab it quickly and place it in an honorable place in your DVD library.
