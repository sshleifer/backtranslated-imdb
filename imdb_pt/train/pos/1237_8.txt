This was a highly original decent film, and a brave move for all involved. I do not care if it's not the most well-organized movie of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy is doing something non-stereotyped, and that I do not know what's going to happen next, makes it one of my favorites . I wish more movies were as imaginative as this, instead of the same old entertainment formula.
