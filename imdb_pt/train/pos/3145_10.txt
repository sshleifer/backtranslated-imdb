That 70s Show is the best TV show of all time. It's up there with Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. The 70's show continued for 8 seasons, all focused on a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships, separating themselves from their parents and their futures in general. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers living side by side. They have lived side by side for most of their lives, and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A big part of the show revolves around how their relationship is working. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so he really pushes Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Even drinking a lot, she treats Eric and his friends very carefully. Bob, your neighbor, is obviously Donna's father. Bob laughs with several different women throughout the history of the series. Bob also annoys Red to the full extent. <br /> <br /> The remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the history of the series. <br /> <br /> Well, Season One is great. That's when the characters begin to feel new things for each other. Season One is original, funny and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Season Two is good, though not as good as the first. It is a basic continuation of the first. Eric and Donna are together, and everything is working out. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He came back and captured the first season feel and mood. I also think the chemistry of the characters has improved a lot, making the show more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Fourth Season is not so good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this, making the show a little less pleasurable. It's still funny, though I did not like it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> Fifth Season is the last season that I enjoyed all the time. It's the senior year of the class, which really helps in the story. Season Five also had the best final of all seasons. <br /> <br /> Season Six is ​​good for the most part. It's extremely funny, though it does not capture the feel of the other seasons. The gang is out of high school, so I believe it did not hit the teenage sensation that previous seasons did. I also did not like the last three or four episodes, considering they had a great drama for them. <br /> <br /> Seventh Season captures the same feeling Season 5 has had in a way, though it does not have it all. I liked Seventh Season as I did everyone else, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> The Last Season turned out to be shit. Eric was not at it, which ruined everything. Kelso also was not in most of the times, which did not help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, and a fitting end to the series. <br /> <br /> So, overall, if you like comedy, try the That 70s Show. They have stopped making new episodes, but it's still on TV a lot. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It's up to you if you want to buy Season 8.
