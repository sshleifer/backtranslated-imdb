Marjorie (a splendid and fascinating performance of Farrah Fawcett) avoids being beaten in her car by the violent serial rapist Joe (superbly interpreted with a frightening conviction and intensity by James Russo). However, Joe steals his wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He pays you a visit on a fateful day. After subjecting Marjorie to much degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and holds him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie going to do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone devise a harsh, hard, and often disturbing tale of morality that astutely spurs the brutality and painful demotion of rape while showing how anyone, when taken to the extreme, is capable of harming acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe sees women strictly as objects, while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal." However, this movie to his admirable credit refuses to make Joe simply a vile one-dimensional nuisance; instead he is a terribly real and pitiful human monster with a wife and a son (Joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely moving). Fawcett and Russo are both excellent on the tracks; they receive support from Diana Scarwid as passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the sensible Patricia, and Sandy Martin as police officer sympathizing with Officer Sudow. Both the agile cinematography of Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Redford's creepy and chilling score greatly increases the considerable claustrophobic tension. A real power.
