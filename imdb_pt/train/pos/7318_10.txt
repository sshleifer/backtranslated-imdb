John Carpenter's Halloween Is it the greatest horror movie ever? no .. maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and always will be. The film is pure genius and will always have a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that you could not see this movie until twenty years after its release, but even twenty years later, after so many imitating cats came and went, the film still had the same impact it must have done So. My father suggested before I went to see the Halloween H20 I picked up and rented Halloween 1 and 2 to have a full story, and after watching Halloween it was clear that he defined and defined the genre Slasher. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is simple. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. Incarcerated for fifteen years, where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown, Haddonfield, where he begins to chase three young girls: Laurie Strode an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett a hard sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok a beautiful young and sexually vigorous. Dr. Loomis traces Michael here where he asks for help from the city's sheriff, Leigh Brackett, who remains skeptical about his story about the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins to kill them one by one, until only Laurie, the innocent and sweet innocent, is the main target of Michael's list. The cast of this movie was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was impressive in his first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave an exciting performance with his small role like Loomis. Nick Castle, who plays Michael did an excellent job as the soulless murderer and evil, and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the great highlights of this film is the chilling score made by John Carpenter himself. which created one of the most well-known horror themes today. The Blue Lighting was scary and effective and one of the great moments in this movie is when young Laurie is curled against a wall after seeing her friends dead, and in the shadows behind her Michael's face materializes before he attacks. Michael's mask was one of the things that sent chills down my spine, the emotionless white face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so good is that it's not a bloody movie different from the tacky Friday The 13 movies actually there is little blood in this movie at all and it works instead of suspense and tension . <br /> <br /> It became so clear that Halloween spawned such films as Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, whom he is a mere bout of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I suggest you watch this movie at least once in your life as it is a milestone in film and is undoubtedly if not the greatest then one of the greatest films of terror of all time.
