Thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese, and his love for the movies. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect introduction to the mind of the most talented American artist working in the cinema today, and I could not recommend it more. I was fascinated with the whole thing and so will you. Just relax and let him take you on a tour of his world, you will love it.
