Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwined subplots that fit beautifully and actors that reflect each other with a precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to see. When Cher's cowardly fiance asks her to help him make amends with his younger, cranky brother, no one can dream of the consequences that follow. Operational symbolism, Catholic Church confessions, love stings and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and gentle. It takes about 15 minutes for the rhythm of the image (there is an initial sequence with the grandfather and his dogs in the graveyard which is a bit rough, and a scene next with Cosmo and the old man at the gate that looks obtuse), but the quilt patchwork of the plot is intertwined with agile ability, and the faltering tone and wacky spirit of the film are both infectious. *** 1/2 of ****
