Sometimes I watch a movie and am I really impressed by it? and yet it is not easy to explain why I enjoyed it so much. Is this true especially for unusual movies? those who can hardly compare with the rest out there. Good evening Mister Tom is one of those special films. Is there a lot of excitement in this movie? and the acting was so good that while watching the movie, I was crying and laughing as the story continued. Young Nick Robinson? is a boy (William) evacuated from London because of air strikes during World War II. Mr. Tom, played by John Thaw, is an elderly man leaving the village to which the evacuated children were sent. <br /> <br /> Tom initially refuses to take on responsibilities - how to take care of a troubled young man? but accepted since it is left without a choice. During the stay, does Mr. Tom discover how life has been horrible for William? next to your luggage did your mother send a belt and written instructions to your child's host? do not hesitate to use it. Is this belt berried in the field? never to be used so brutally. Mr. Tom offers a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly, a letter from William is called home in London with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling well and starts all over again? only this time it gets much worse? Are there many feelings you can feel in this movie? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope? and much more. Good evening Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema comparable only with others such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? if someone else is comparing. I really enjoyed watching and recommending it. Before finishing this review I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac ?? reminded me of a friend of mine since my childhood (:
