This was another message from the Second World War to the soldiers and Allies to be careful about the spread of rumors. These were called "instructional" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character named "Pvt. Snafu." <br /> <br /> We all have imaginations, along with fears and what-you have, and this is what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and appears with "five." You can start panic and all kinds of disasters spread enough rumors and enough people believe in them. This includes losing confidence in your country and its cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. This is still being done today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," declares a great foolishness near the end of this cartoon. Incredible as some Americans have not yet learned. This cartoon can be 65 years old, but it certainly has relevance today. As I write this, there have been two terrorist attacks in Europe today and some people still think the "War on Terror" is just a slogan of stickers. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess", uses analogies of "hot air balloon juice" to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (your real name), you know the rhymes will be smart. <br /> <br /> Nothing hilarious here, but it was not meant to be. You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that existed during World War II. People forget that the war could have ended easily with the other side winning. It was a tense time
