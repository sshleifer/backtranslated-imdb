Terry Gilliam traveled again to the future (he had already done this in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that is destroying the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy with some easy tricks in it but it's a lot of fun and Gilliam proves he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her?) Are OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand, he is forced and has no credibility all. It should only represent successful and successful young people. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 7/10
