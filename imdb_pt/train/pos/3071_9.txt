Panic delivers the goods ten times with Oscar-caliber performances of William H Macy, Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland. In a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with. Chillingly Honest and thought provoking, Panic is easily one of the best movies to get out of Hollywood in years. The impact stays with you shortly after you leave the theater.
