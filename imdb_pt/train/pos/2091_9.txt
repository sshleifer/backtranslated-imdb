What Irving Thalberg did in making this movie today would never be tried again. Making a Chinese story with Western players, even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly, among others. <br /> <br /> It may be partly because the story was written by a Westerner, Pearl Buck, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his novel in 1932. Buck, the daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than anyone else. Not the political struggles of China, but the life and toil of every day people we meet on Good Earth. Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became apologist for the Chiang Kai-Shek Kuomintang China in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of his literary output never equaled Good Earth. <br /> <br /> In the Sundowners there is a great description of comparing China to Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked about the difference, Ustinov said that China was very large and very crowded and that Australia was very large and very empty. This is what you see in The Good Earth, China too big and too full of people, more than it can handle sometimes. Earth Good tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who buys a wife from a large house where he was a slave. The woman O-Lan (Luise Rainer) gives him two children and sees him during all the good and bad moments, drought, hunger, revolution and a climatic plague. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer won the award. second consecutive Oscar for playing O-Lan. She may have established some sort of record, as it has to be the main Oscar performance with the least amount of dialogue. Everything she does practically is done with facial expressions, her performance could have been in a silent movie with minimal subtitles. I think only Ryan's Daughter's John Mills had fewer words and was playing a mentally retarded man. <br /> <br /> Muni does not always appreciate the degree of support he has in this male-dominated culture. Rainer helps in the field, carries and breeds children, does household chores. When Muni becomes a man of property, he takes a second Chinese wife who causes him great pain. Still Rainer stoically carries everything. Yet Muni is not a bad man and is a tribute to the film and its acting and Buck is writing that you do not hate him and that the cultural gap is overcome. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of oriental players who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised The Good Earth of all the movies has not been redone at the moment. I bet the Chinese government would allow even an American company to do that in a real place. <br /> <br /> Until we have a great classic to enjoy and appreciate.
