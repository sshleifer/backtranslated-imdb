It was released in France on DVD several years ago - I would like it to be reissued with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz, which receives negative reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the king's daughter. He leaves to join the army and goes to war. Her love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in one of the first films for her. I will not ruin the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at an early age, a great loss for moviedom.
