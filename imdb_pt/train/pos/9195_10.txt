I do not give a movie or a show ten very often, but this show touched a nerve in a way that no other program did. I found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought the premise seemed interesting, so I took a look at it. I was not disappointed by what I saw; I was moved. This story stays on the side of the contest as the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played by Koyuki, shows us human nature how it wants to prevent problems from being shown. No one really wants to put their soul in front of a prospect mate. So instead, she replaces a human, played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is just like any other creature we consider a pet. The difference; he can retaliate in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog. As it is treated as a pet, it reacts to situations such as a dog may react. She spends time with her new boyfriend, Momo gets jealous. It is when she realizes that her pet is not just a pet that the sexual tension between the two begins to become thick - Momo is a dance prodigy. His thinking changes slowly as we begin to take a look at his own thoughts. Matsumoto leads us not to see a character who is very one-dimensional in the beginning, two-dimensional when we see that he is a dancer, a three-dimensional character when we see him begin to fall in love with his master as a man, not as a dog. In my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop. In addition, Matsumoto interprets Momo with such tenderness that you almost start to wish to have one too. She does not even want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but how does Momo (the name she gives you as a new puppy name) state? we both knew it would not last. Watch this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
