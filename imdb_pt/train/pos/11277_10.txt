Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle. Some men come looking for ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity - a better sequence than the original. "Tarzan the Monkey Man" of 1932 was good, but it had some terrible special effects and was dragged. This one has much better effects and is much more adult. There are tons of flagrant racism (a black man is shot to death - and nobody cares), but that was in 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (for a 1934 film) and uncut prints make Jane a long dive underwater totally naked! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing almost nothing and (implied) they sleep together and have sex - without being married. That would not bother anyone today, but in 1934 that was very radical. <br /> <br /> That aside, the film is well directed, very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in this lion cloth is certainly a treat for Jane's eyes and clothing is very revealing as well. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane, but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone is fine. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan out there. Worth seeing but not for kids!
