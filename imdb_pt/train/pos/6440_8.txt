I never seem to write a review in IMDb, unless I'm extremely surprised at how good, or how bad, a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. Every year, I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars, even those that I know I will not like. "How is it in heaven" seems to fit the bill. The storyline sounds sugary, sentimental and slow ... To my taste, they run more into the original, dark and / or daring foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Fran√ßois Ozon, a lot of modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "As It Is In Heaven "did not seem particularly interesting ... It was not released in the US, so I sat down to watch a VCD I found in Singapore, getting ready to" cross it off the list. " After a tedious start, "As It Is In Heaven" becomes that rare movie where you really get inspired by what's happening on the screen. Weaknesses: The characters in the film are pure "characters" - the Wounded Dreamer, the Town Bully, the Wifeed Wife, the Loose Woman Yearning for Love, the Repressed Minister .... Fortunately, they are largely a nice group. , besides being well written and well represented. Ingela Olsson, as the pastor's wife, Inger, would have been nominated for an Oscar if her performance had been in English. Strengths: the music is beautiful, and the main song, sung by Gabriella, is truly dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye on the daring 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who is following the dance steps and the younger girls! I will not discuss the ending, but I will say it makes sense. They are a lot of emotional things going on in the last hour of the movie, and you are not sure why they are happening. Although nothing is explained in words, everything makes sense as the films reach a crescendo. **** outside of *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen.
