Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography I do not think so. This movie was not very terrible, but it was not much better than average. The main story dealing with highly immature teenagers should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why it was ... should have gotten into that instead of just scraping the surface with "because the mother says we can not." Some parts should have been abandoned altogether or reworked to have more importance in the suffering of the two main characters. Sometimes I wanted to know if the writer / director was a fan of George Lucas' classic American Graffiti. Not that it's wrong to be a fan of this movie, but making your movie sometimes looks that way, I mean, come on! The worst part of it was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, I mean, come on! She was the only one, in one or two lines, who actually tried a southern accent. (Listen, it was there even if her character was from California!) Maybe if she was the star that others could have followed and we had a movie with a more authentic sound. Oh, well, what you can do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist, either. What a pity. Overall I give this a B-and that's being kind of generous because I'm partial to Mrs. Amick.
