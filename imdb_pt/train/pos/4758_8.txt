After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have fallen on frozen wood, two police officers found evidence that the event actually happened and apparently a Martian moved away. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way Caf√© and find a bus stopped and seven passengers awaiting the reopening of a snow-covered bridge. However, the driver says he had only six passengers when he parked the bus. While questioning travelers, strange things happen in the cafeteria, with the lights on and off and the turntable turning on and off. When passengers are cleared and the bus follows their journey, a passenger returns to the cafeteria and reveals a plot of invasion of the Earth. <br /> <br /> "Will the true Martian please stand up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected point in the end. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Martian" ("The Martian")
