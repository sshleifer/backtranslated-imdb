I love cinema, so what I'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply. I had given the thumbs down to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without having seen the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt trapped by ... who? I do not really know, but there has been a negative word of mouth that has spread like savage fire and, no matter how clever I think I am, I have fallen for it. But fortunately, I met an Argentine film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I was not going to see why he knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me in the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. I went to see the two parts immediately and, "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I saw in 2008. It is, in such a purity that you will remember the work of some of the great masters of the past. Consideration by your audience is something we are no longer accustomed to. I do not know if we ever went. Riveting, moving, no concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can really see it. Mankind's humanity is overwhelming. So thank you Martin Donovan once again for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this movie frame. Do not make the mistake I was about to commit. Go see now, on the big screen
