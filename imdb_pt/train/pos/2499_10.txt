This movie was incredible. It had an original concept (that of a vampire movie meets the Yakuza Mafia movie). It is a humorous and highly dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and comments subtly on society. On the part of Gackt Camui, Sho's role was excellently delivered, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the torturous and humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and cried with the carefree character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like the funny Cigarette scene, the fighting scenes and, above all, the ultimate heartrenching.
