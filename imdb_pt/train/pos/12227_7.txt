I looked for this after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging "Clueless" (1995), perhaps the best known effort of Alicia Silverstone since the beginning of her film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should be helpful in improving most of the film projects. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only disappointment I think the film has for me is an awkward "feel" for some of the scenes, coming from the need to create a rather uncompromising and mature theme as part of what begins in tone as a high school adventure. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is very good at this one. She carries well the naive enthusiasm and increasing discomfort that affects Mary Giordano as she maneuvers to the truth behind the serial killings. I think your characterization of MG has some mileage too. The inference of the story line is that it follows a career in law enforcement. It may be really interesting for an older Silverstone to revisit Giordano at a time of crisis later in the life of the officer. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has writing credit. I do not know of any other movie that the PV has done. I can only imagine what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown supporting cast, though Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly that. Over the last decade, he seems to have managed to secure an impressive number of onscreen appearances. I remember seeing him recently in "Carriers" (1998), made for a TV show with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic American comedy "Who's the Boss" may also have an interest in "Carriers," because the protagonist is Judith Light, remembered fondly by many because of her long involvement with the show. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" could easily not have worked, but no problem. I think it's a fun story that's worth seeing.
