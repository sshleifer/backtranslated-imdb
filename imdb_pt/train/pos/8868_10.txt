I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the top 3 movies I've ever watched. He has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in the university can be. There are three main story lines, the skinheads, the African Americans and the homosexuals. I was intrigued by all the stories, but the one that got me the most was the story about Kristen, fighting her feelings about another girl. The end was great. After seeing the movie 25 times more, I still cry. I would have given this movie an 11, but I have to settle for 10/10.
