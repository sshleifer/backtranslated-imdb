Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action-packed of the series, and is a good conclusion for the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo trapped by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing a tough fight against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can do that. The Opening sequence, in Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a well of slavery and slag, and new home for Han Solo, as Luke and his gang prepare for his ransom, and with the powers Luke's Jedi, they have the upper hand. <br /> <br /> We also witnessed a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy fight against Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields that protect the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battles with the Imperial Fleet as they wait for the shields to fall, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An epic end to a classic saga, and it's just just the rhythm of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
