by 1976 I had just moved to Ceylon from us. I was 23 years old and married just over three years ago and starting out as a lesbian. I saw this movie on an old black and white TV, with a terrible reception, alone and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed an echo of history. I was living in a small house in Tucson Arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone else here, I never forgot the feelings that the images of this story provoked, and its residue of fragile magic, and I kept a hope that I would come back to see one day. I'll keep checking. I'd also like someone to make a Shirley Verel movie "on the other side of Venus." also has the same delicacy and persistence ...
