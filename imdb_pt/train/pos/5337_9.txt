It may be the remake of the 1987 Autumn Tale after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung said. Mabel employs rock music as a means to express her personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and consequent frustration play significant roles. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the deep feeling, and yet it is not very inappropriate to use it, since the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than ordinary life. The director focuses on the representation of the subtle affection and vanity of life rather than mere rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is delivered in a delicate and touching way through good performance. Mabel does not try to embellish rock musicians as artists, instead she tries to reproduce a real life on the screen, making great efforts of years working on this project and gathering information in underground bars in Beijing. <br /> <br /> Daniel has probably given the best performance in all his films made so far. His innate and reticent dismay fit perfectly into the blue mood of the movie.
