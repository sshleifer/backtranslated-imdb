Laputa: the castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as its latest works and purer, fancier and fancier pirates, how could it be any better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after that, (I'm not sure if this was the first time I heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response to any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally amazing and the boy, Pazu is also a great model - he lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not give up, but the ending is really great. I rate this as one of Miyazaki's top three with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also, you may want to check Moving Castle of the Howling when it comes out (sometime next year I hope) If you like Miyazaki check this one as it is readily available in the USA. Enjoy, Piper A
