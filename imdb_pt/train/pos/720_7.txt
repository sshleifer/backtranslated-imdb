Imagine what school would be like in a world like this: children are a great gang who have great musical taste and unite against bad directors and teachers. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is happening in this world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. The characters are as silly, innocent, and charming as the Ramones songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High school comedies really have changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with that classic of the late 70's, where no meaningless sex joke is made. Since a remake is apparently in progress, you can expect the charm of the original to get lost on the way and be replaced by vulgar and half-joking jokes like Bill Hicks used to call them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place. So the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, however quirky and charming. Gabba gabba hey!
