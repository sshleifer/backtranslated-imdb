I just read the main comment for this movie that is on the first page with the voting results and casting. <br /> <br /> Why some people can not have a movie for what it's supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be a light heart, toning cheek, familiar comedy, things to make kids laugh and things to adults, and that's exactly what this movie does. /> <br /> I laughed out loud in this movie, I thought Carey had a great performance and the whole movie (if attended at Christmas) really gave you some festive joy <br /> <br /> So everyone you movie reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and hit all the movies, because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and they make movies for what they should be, entertainment!
