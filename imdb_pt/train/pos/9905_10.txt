I lost count of how many reviews I wrote about Slaughter High. I read a lot of bad ones and I will say now that this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in no time for his well-known suicide, and even though this was his only film, he is what made the film so good. At first I knew nothing about Simon until I read a review of his suicide. So I discovered due to the current page at www.IMDb.com he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his true self certainly had its strengths and weaknesses. He did a good job of acting, who can disagree? I always wondered how he felt naked in a movie. It must have been too embarrassing to say the least. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old in sixth grade. I agree with some pointers how the girl would not bathe after someone was murdered, and that high schools do not have tubs! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time, was the only other star who had a decent talent and unfortunately, because of Simon's death, he did not make future films. The reason for his suicide is a mystery, and we hope it will be discovered in the near future. Doing the math on his page, he says he was 29 when he did Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs up, the best horror movie ever made. Probably because of their horrible acting, the others did not make fame in the movie business. -Jacob Young
