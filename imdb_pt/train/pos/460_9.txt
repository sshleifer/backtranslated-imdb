This is a wonderful new series of crimes, bringing together three British television veterans (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) while retired detectives are brought back to help settle old cases under the leadership of younger Amanda Redman. The three old, irritable cops form a brilliant team, applying twenty-year-old detection methods to a police force that has made great strides ever since - sometimes in effect at other times, to the horror of their senior officers. The three are portrayed with sympathy, warts and everything. There are splendid comic scenes, and some very moving, as each of the three has to deal with the aging and legacy of their past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we promised another series next year) that each of the characters had developed. The widower James Bolam can not accept the premature death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication! While Amanda Redman has to face the family conflict between having a life and a career. The story lines were interesting, though quite dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But it is the interaction of four of Britain's best actors who made the series a must-see.
