I grew up in Brazil and used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coastline where the film was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings back to life the 16th-century world of Brazil, where Europeans barely started exploring the coast, which was still pure and sparsely populated by several native tribes. French and Portuguese fought each other for the territory and the advantage over the Brazilian timber trade, while negotiating with the natives, who also fought each other for any reason. <br /> <br /> A French misfit ("the mercenary") is left to die for his own countrymen, but manages to escape and is held prisoner by a bare native tribe. While he is a "slave" to the chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he can live in relative comfort for months until it is the right time for him to be killed and eaten in a revenge ritual. What I love about this movie is that it recreates in loving detail the villages of the natives and their way of life (they walked naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept life in those times. was: in a beautiful garden of Eden, life was confused, violent, full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs. Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no romances "nobles" or "heroic explorers" romanticized here, they are just people trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film is not unduly understanding or disregarding the natives. From what I know of the subject, the representation is very precise, which adds an air of singularity to the project: how many movies have you seen about the life of the Brazilian natives and their first subjects with the Europeans?
