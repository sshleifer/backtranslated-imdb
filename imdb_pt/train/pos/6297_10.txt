My friends and I were just discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic comedy are being made. We are offended by the shock that Hollywood is serving these days, as they act as if everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything is okay ... with the exception of some bright spots like this movie. He does not have the big names of the actors, the big budget, I do not think he had a great release (I rented from Hollywood Video) he really does not have anything that the bigger budget romantic comedy has. <br /> <br /> But he had what most of them do not have. He had great chemistry among love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Your love story was not forced on us like so many. The director took the time to let these characters really know each other. Your story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie." <br /> <br /> The supporting cast added not only funny comic moments but also the depth of the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely invaluable. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues in a Psychic Hotline was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how great it is to fall in love.
