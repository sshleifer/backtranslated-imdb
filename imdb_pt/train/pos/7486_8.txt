I really like this movie for some reasons I'm going to delay, but I want to play it because I think people do not like it. First, there are people out there who just love to hate Tom Cruise. I do not really understand this. Second, Cameron Crowe, I think p *** successfully off two groups of moviegoers with this movie. The casual, laid back, "not looking to think too much" group of movie goers are left confused when the plot takes a total of 180 at the end of the film. And the deep, philosophical, mystery fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters fully explaining the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a pretty good job at it. I think it's probably his best performance than I've seen, although I have not seen all his movies, or even most of them, probably. The support cast is good too. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I like the story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but for the most part it's just a good story. And it has many philosophical aspects, and many similar ideas and stories occur in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man who had everything he wanted, more or less lost, was given a second chance with a catch to retrieve everything back, and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening, chooses reality, simplicity and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never hold onto: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people were disappointed that Crowe put all the mystery in the end. I think it's necessary. The public then knows, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that David is aware of his circumstances and makes the choice at the end even more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie is great. It's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. Particularly, "Njosnavelin" by Sigur Ros, which is an incredible song. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would give 3 out of 4 stars. It is a film with some substance for those who like to think about things and a great story for those who want to relax. This "moderate" approach is probably why people do not like it so much because it is not a complete mystery or a complete love story. It mixes and combines different elements and genres.
