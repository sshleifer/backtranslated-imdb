Much has been said about "psychological westerns," but this is one of the few who really are in that genre. It has great names that act very well, but it is the director who makes this a movie so good. Stewart Granger loses his stereotype of British safari hunter to play a retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the rookie (in contrast to the always-young rookie, Taylor's character is also middle-aged) who wants to shoot down buffalo and entice Granger to do business with him. They hire two other big names from actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to be their skinners. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing he may be to blame if they become extinct, knowing that if they become extinct, the Native American way of life will suffer greatly. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic realism, unlike the unidimensional sadists of modern cinema, created by nerds and dorks. He is insecure and needs human companionship. Still, he will not stop at murder. The ending puts them both against each other, with an astounding conclusion. The psychological effects of what they are doing are well represented.
