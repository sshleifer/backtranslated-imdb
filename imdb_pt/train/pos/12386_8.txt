'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror films ever made in the movie industry! I think it's pretty scary how few movies really are. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. She dates a lawyer named Michael Lerman and has another best friend named model Jennifer. Everything was great in her life, until she decides to live alone for a while and rents out a beautiful old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is the neighbors, who are very, very strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to have health problems and passes out frequently; She also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and this has to do with the new house she's living ... <br /> <br /> I personally find '' The Sentinel '' a very scary movie, and along with '' The Exorcist '' are two of the scariest movies I've ever watched. When we find out that Alison's house is only occupied by the priest and by herself, my blood froze! It's also horrible to see that she needs to be blind at the end of the movie to be the new sentry to keep the monsters away from our world.
