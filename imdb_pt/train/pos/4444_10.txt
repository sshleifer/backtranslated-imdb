Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since then because it has no connection to the first two Demons films. And with "Demons III" in the title, someone would say it would be. The problem is that this movie was never intended to be part of the Demons series. The distributors only a "Demons III" above their original title "The Ogre" to profit from the popularity of other films. The new American DVD release of this image has the title "Demons III: The Ogre" in box art, but the film itself says "The Ogre." I do not know if previous releases had the title "Demons III" in the film itself, but this new release seems to be a lie. If you can get through "Demons III" in the title, you can enjoy some "The Ogre". It starts with a creeping intro, and it quite crawls everywhere. There are no gore and movies in the movie slowly, but I still dug. Just do not expect it to be like the other Demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should give it a try.
