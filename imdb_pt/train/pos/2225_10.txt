I'm completely shocked that this show had been canceled. It only lasted a year. I just recently started watching and I love it.Its a show that could go as far as friends was.Have the mood and it was extremely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> These are two brothers and two sisters living under one roof, without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the older brother and takes on a more paternal role. <br /> <br /> This should last much longer than the year, since it was fantastic. Incredible show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
