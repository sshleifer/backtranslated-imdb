I read holes in 5th grade when I heard they were making a movie I was in a trance! Of course, being busy, I did not get a chance to see the movie in theaters. Holes was in the drive-in just out of town, but unfortunately we were very busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen and none of them invited me! Everyone said it was good but I read great books that made low quality movies so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came. It was that week and my parents were going on a cruise and I was left to take care of it. My sister, who is 9 years old, watched and loved it! So I took to the other people that I was babysitting the house and her children, 9 and 4, liked it too. Even my parents loved it and are deffinately film critics. Overall, I highly recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morals and loves a hilarious cast! This movie should be in your top 5 "see" list !!!!
