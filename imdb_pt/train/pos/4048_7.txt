Rohmer deviates from his usual portraits of the French middle class to tell this drama about the difficulties of an aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What is most appealing about "La Anglaise ..." (beyond its own history) is the fabulous aesthetic that Rohmer has achieved. The pictures were digitally decorated and also look like baroque photos. At times you can not tell if you're watching a movie or a series of photos at the Louvre Musseum. Each shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> --- eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu ---------
