Brazilian films tend to get more positive ratings than they really deserve. Quite unbelievably, Contra Todos (the original title, which the producers discarded: God Against Everybody) obtained a very low GPA on this website. It seems to be downright rejected by female broadcasters in general. In fact, it's not so brutal. I mean, with regard to graphic violence. His brutality is intrinsic as it portrays aspiring lumpens, that is, citizens who actually have high-tech equipment, who coldly execute assassination orders in exchange for "big money." Is this postmodern man? His only concern is a quick, almost impersonal, ultra permissive layman, amid satiating meals over? The photo is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004, so far. His brilliant editing style, Ã  la Godard, his curious counterpoint soundtrack, his more than efficient global cast, and, above all, his original narration, with subtle non-chronological occult points that come to light only in the epilogue, deserve the less an 8 mark.
