I saw this movie in the movies and I was impressed by it. So, again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the silly, arrogant, hollywoodian bitch she is today. Anyway, this movie really struck me as one of the crudest, most realistic and beautiful friendship films. How far would you really go for your best friend? I was brought to tears at the end, and still tear when I watch now (I own it). I remember that as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed with her how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. However be prepared for the conversation almost right after, where she turns to you and asks if you would do something like that to her ....
