Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all that is meant to be. Fortunately there is no social or political message, nor is there any attempt to do so. Could the plot really happen or have it occurred at some specific time or place? It is unlikely, since, after all, this is simply a movie, and movies are born of the imagination, not of reality. The sole purpose of this film is to entertain, certainly not to educate and entertain, with reality delightfully and joyfully thrown to the winds. I think most would agree that, from documentaries, we expect enlightenment and authenticity. But for entertainment, I want what is nowadays described as a "no-brainer", which The Mating Game is in every respect. From a few laughter and a frank laugh every once in a while, this is a fine fantasy.
