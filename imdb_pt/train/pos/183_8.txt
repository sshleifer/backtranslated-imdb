Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the affable William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood in search of stardom. Cameo's performances show "all the stars in MGM's paradise" in the commissioner's famous scene, as well as many details of producing old movies for the scholar. Pic also captures for posterity Davies's famous and sarcastic imitations of the day's top stars (she Swanson is a beauty!). <br /> <br /> Peggy catches up when she meets the famous star Marian. Davies in the sneakers, raises his nose and says, "Ohh, I do not like her!" <br /> <br /> My impression was perfect. History, direction, acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados.
