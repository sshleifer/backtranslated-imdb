This was a great movie with a good cast, all of them on all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best, well, there is nothing better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the script. None of the characters recognized that the dead daughter was not always a good person. Nor her mother, played by Keaton. At one point she breaks a promise she made to a character not to reveal that he was sleeping around. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said that the film had a "political agenda". That's a bewildering thing to say. There was no politics at all in this movie.
