A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai gave their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural touch to the film and I felt it well. It seemed that bollywood finally gave in to its glamor and had some quality performers onscreen. In terms of content, the film portrayed very well what exactly happened during the filming showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that confidence in one's life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that they did not make it a drama with too much shedding of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
