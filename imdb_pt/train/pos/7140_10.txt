20 of 10 This is a truly wonderful story about a war evacuee and a grumpy carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is with Tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious problems when wetting his bed the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow they both find solace in each other. It turns out that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choirmaster in a fun version of Jerusalem. William is a friend of Zacharias Wrench, a young Jew from London and, along with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and to feel part of this nearby small community. Just as he is settling down, William is called back to London by his mother, and this is where we see why he is so screwed. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear from William, he travels to London to look for him. He finally finds him holding his dead little sister where he was tied up in a basement. After a period in the hospital, Tom realizes that he must kidnap him and take him home with him. The climax is a bitter ending when William is informed that he must be adopted by Tom while at the same time learning that his best friend Zacharias was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most touching scenes was when Tom was talking to an Interior Ministry official. <br /> <br /> I love, and for what it's worth, I think he loves me too. <br /> <br /> Does not it just improve what it does?
