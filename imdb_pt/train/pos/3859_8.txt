De Verdeven's Vierde Man is one of the most convincing thrillers I've ever seen. It was a really pleasant surprise. The story concerns bisexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is drawn into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in Gerard's distorted mind there may be more in the story. Verhoeven and filmmaker Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere, full of surreal and disgusting sexual images, this really draws you into the story, you do not want to watch, but you can not get away. This is by far the best film of Verhoeven (perhaps second only to Robocop). True The Fourth Man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are completely free (just ignore them, but believe me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked.) This is one of those movies you need to know how it ends , a true whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. I even like the metaphor of the spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
