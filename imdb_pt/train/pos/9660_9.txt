Only after some contemplation did I decide that I liked this movie. And after reading reviews of all the other posters here, and thinking about it a bit more, I decided that I enjoyed it tremendously. I love American movies - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. "Presque rien," on the other hand, makes no such attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say it's "too artistic." In every way, this movie is meant to evoke your sense memories. So often throughout the film you feel you are there ... you feel the summer sun, the breeze, the warmth, the cold of winter, the company, the loneliness, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In every respect, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - and that's why so many people feel so strongly that the movie has disappointed them. After I finished watching, I felt the same. But with some reflection, I recognized that this was how the movie had to be: 'Story' is not the narrative, it's the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they are rich, exquisite and alive with details and nuances. Although I normally can not tolerate movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it's not a 'supposed' movie to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
