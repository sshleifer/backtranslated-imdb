Dude, if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title, then you're a retard and you deserve to be disappointed. As for me, I was expecting a low budget zombie cheeseball movie and that's exactly what I got. I was not dissapointed. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly as they should because all the zombies had been transformed, so they are zombies undead. Obviously they did this because it would have been very expensive if they had made a rotten zombie. I understood the whole thing, I have no idea how seriously anyone could criticize this movie. It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for the love of God! Do you watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANWU Boll movies and do you really expect it to be great? Of course not! So why are there some jerks at IMDb whining like schoolgirls about this movie, I'll never understand. Oh yeah, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that was the worst you've ever seen, because you know you're full of it! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead" ???? These are some of the worst I have ever seen. If you can not see it's just a low budget zombie movie, obviously made by fans of zombie movies, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Thumbs up from me and I would also like to see a sequel.
