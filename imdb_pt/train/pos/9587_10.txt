Fifteen years later, Paris Is Burning is still on fire. This is a classic of black gay movies, along with the other honorary black homosexual films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures the culture and gay community underground and underclass and black as no other work before or after, including all the retrospectives and sentimental homosexual representations of the Harlem Rennaissance. They're good, but this is the best. I say the only "real" movie you'll find on the subject is Relentlessy Cunty (the classic invention of house music) comes to Hollywood, a hilarious and uninterrupted camp (as only we do) and social criticism inoperative All this for a white director (who obviously must have been a sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a previous life). I could go on, but I think you got the point: I love this movie!
