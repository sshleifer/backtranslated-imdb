Today's science fiction thrillers are more like Rambo in outer space, with monstrous special effects (often ridiculous, like sounds of explosions in the space vacuum). Despite current standards, the special effects of the "Forbidden Planet" were impressive for their time. Even today, they still have plausibility. However, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason why radio thrillers still have appeal. Much of what was happening was left to the public's imagination. (What were Krell's creatures like?) Because most of the structure of the story was never released or only revealed at the end, the tension and suspense that occurred throughout the film. The ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (if not the best) science fiction movie ever made.
