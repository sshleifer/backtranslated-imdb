I have not seen each and every one of Chan's movies, but this is certainly the best I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story itself is nothing special, so I will not win. go deeper into it. What makes it special are the tricks, the fight, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie has a fierce beat all the time and you're just surprised to see it. All the cool maneuvers (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump on the couch and scream. It's simply incredible! Even my mother was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it. <br /> <br /> I know this police story can be a little hard to come by, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth a try.
