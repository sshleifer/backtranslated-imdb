At least something good came out of Damon Runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mob. "Guys and Dolls," the seemingly indestructible musical, was filmed in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and enjoyable film that featured a cast of stars including Vivian Blaine Broadway), Jean Simmons (whose character bears a striking resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the greatest protagonists of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both recently winners of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor To Eternity "and Best Actor (" On the Waterfront ") and were at the top of their game. Since Brando singing "Luck is a Lady Tonight", he talks a lot about the place where Dylan started his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Johnson, who knocks the house down with "Sit down you're swinging the boat." The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his gallery of cheaters. The film has a brilliant and caricature look, anticipating Pop Art from the early 1960s. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish languages. Although the social attitudes and gender roles of the film are dated, it's all very entertaining, and even the gentle play of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real animosity toward organized religion. Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is reason enough to watch this movie, but there are plenty of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.
