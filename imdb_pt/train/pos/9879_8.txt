Presenting Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easier roles she has had at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify. A young woman with enough talent for ten, she knows she has what it takes to get to the theater, no matter how much the producer Van Heflin from her hometown discourages. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy in this movie. one like the girl determined to do it in the theater. Because it's Judy Garland with Judy Garland's talent, you in the audience know she has the right stuff, even if it takes almost the entire movie to convince Van Heflin. <br /> <br /> Judy and Heflin come from the film. same small town, Heflin's father was the city doctor who delivered her and Heflin while he could have moved and become a major Broadway producer, their respective mothers, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington, kept in touch. This is his entrance, but Heflin is constantly bombarded with stagetruck kids, but never someone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> No major music success left Presenting Lily Mars for Garland, although she sang all her numbers. The best of the film is a rebirth of the brown age, each movement has its own meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist as the cleaning lady at a Broadway theater where the Heflin show is being produced. Gilchrist was a star back in the days of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in style with Connie. It's the best scene in the film while Gilchrist encourages Judy to continue. The composer Karl Hoschna died a long time ago, but the lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I'm betting he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> European musical star Marta Eggerth is presenting Lily Mars as the star of the show. who at first is perplexed, then angry and finally, understanding Garland and Heflin. She made some films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent. I'm betting that MGM was not sure what to do with it and its strong Hungarian accent, even though Louis B. Mayer never knew a soprano he did not like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin becomes a well-producing patient who takes great care of Garland and Eggerth. Heflin was leaving his Oscar for Johnny Eager the year before and he and Garland did not seem to be an ideal screen team, but they are not bad together. <br /> <br /> Introducing Lily Mars is a fine show for the talents of Judy Garland. And she did not have to share the screen in another backstage movie with Mickey Rooney.
