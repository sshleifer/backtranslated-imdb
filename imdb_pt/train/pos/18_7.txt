Stanley and Iris is a film about warming the hearts of two people who meet and help each other overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widow with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley to read at his house in his spare time. Over time they get romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes out on a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him. <br /> <br /> It's a really good movie, without nudity, violence or profanity, which is rare in today's movies. A good movie all round. <br /> <br />
