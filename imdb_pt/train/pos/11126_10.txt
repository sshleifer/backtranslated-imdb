The Sopranos is arguably the biggest show in the history of Dramatic Television. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series that offers so much intelligence, sublime writing or first-rate performances. <br /> <br /> Epic Scope It produces new and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Focusing around the life of a Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two children of the nuclear family, the other is an enormous group of the New Jersey Mafia, of which he is the chief of both. Played by James Gandolfini, True Romance and The Mexican, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also nice guy. Gandolfini should be commended for making a womanizing and horribly aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leader man. Contemporay The American drama never had a figure as impressive and iconic as Tony. <br /> <br /> The cast of hundreds never boasts of a flat performance and prominent characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stay in his memory forever. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this tale, however, is the creator and brave writers and revolutionary take on a series of conventional drama. Sequences of twenty-minute dreams, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical images and truly shocking scenes of violence. However, this whole style is faced by truly touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never becomes cold-hearted or gratuitous. <br /> <br /> With now competitive and often poor TV, The Sopranos stands out from the rest as the most original and compelling drama in the United States. Forget Family Redefined. This is television redefined.
