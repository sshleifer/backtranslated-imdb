Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the circuit of art houses to madness with the intriguing and surprisingly clever Cube, which is my favorite movie of the 90s. It framed the basic concept of a group of strangers trapped in a giant cube-shaped labyrinth, filmed entirely in a single set, and adopted this idea in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I look forward to Natali's accompaniment, and although it took five years for him to set up another project, I'm glad to say it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of a man's place in the world, and as through a completely logical chain of events, he finds himself in a situation beyond his control. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of Cypher's joys is the different avenues that brings us down. It's so refreshing nowadays to see a science fiction movie that has more than one idea in mind. Cypher is one of those films. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the kindest people ever to travel the planet, is hired by DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars. To their perplexity, they are incredibly annoying. Covering such mundane themes as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he meets Rita Foster (a flawless Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice maiden. She gives him the brush, but there is something for her that he finds irresistible. This is not very surprising considering the dry marriage he is. <br /> <br /> When Rita appears in another of Morgan's seminars, she tells him that her life is not what it seems. And I'm not saying anything more about the plot. Doing so would cheapen the impact that the rest of the film has on us as well as the devious way that is so much fun to follow. As with Cube, Natali shows a talent for engaging seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they are pushed into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But it's not a copy of the Cube. It has its own inspiration. Cypher is a film that has more in common with the thrillers of conspiracy and stories of paranoia. One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes go into history without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it is as much a shock to us as to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is. Where Cube has been confined to a minimalist setting and a tight budget with a cast of unknowns, Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natali saves as much as he can, allowing him to broaden the horizon and cast Morgan on an incredible journey. through the labyrinth of their own identity. <br /> <br /> Natali's leadership is exceptional with a skilled hand on the reins. There are some incredible camera angles such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast and robust office block in conjunction with the insignificant point that Morgan is standing outside. All the color seems to have been bled out of the image, which complements the tone of the film perfectly like a modern film-noir. <br /> <br /> Performance is uniformly excellent throughout. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure in his loveless marriage to question his own identity. Its performance is excellent because it is so modulated. It literally seems to turn out right before our eyes. From a helpless clinical coward to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett makes a welcome appearance that has had such an impact on Cube. He resides in a secret silo that seems to have been borrowed from Men in Black. His scene is one of the best because it is a carefully calculated exercise of suspense and paranoia. He is a supposed expert at identifying dual agents, and is a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly represented by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we're drawn to his complex mental game. <br /> <br /> But it's Lucy Liu who's the scene thief here. It is often cast in films in which its potential is not used for the full effect. But in Cypher, she finally gets a character that fits her like a glove. Rita is a reserved and reserved femme fatale that Liu lives with pleasure. I cheered up every time she showed up because she is always in control, and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy gaze alone. <br /> <br /> Things come to a very satisfying end, this does not happen. conclude with an ambiguous note the way Cube did. But Morgan deserves its happy ending. After he was put on the bell that way, I praised him for the final scene. It's a perfect final time because it comes as a ray of sunshine after 90 sombre minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher succeeds in every way. Surrounding, shocking, always entertaining, that's all Total Recall wanted to be, but it was not. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix. <br /> <br /> A good accompaniment to Natali. And now I'm a committed fan of man. Magnificent things!
