I saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deathly intelligent, stylish and FUNNY. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work from Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and up, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it. Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie plunged into a lot of political subtext - but they did not hit you in the head. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and made sense. There is a veritable carnivorous spirit in this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to cure bad mood. <br /> <br /> I loved it !!!
