This is one of those movies you pass on when you're surfing the channel on a Saturday afternoon, and you're drawn to it and you end up watching the whole thing. I thought I was well-behaved and it really made me feel for the characters. Although a little slow, focusing more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it has never been boring. We do not really see much of all the robberies that they have been so legendary, and instead, most of the shootings happen when they are ambushed by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with her character. Moving from a good country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray, and I liked the subtlety she brought to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, an above-average effort, especially considering it was a made-for-TV movie.
