Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he is forced to save his life from his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he ruins a job, completing his job of stealing 50 cars at his brothers. one night. He has to gather his old team that he can trust to help him make his bro out of the Dutch. But the cops are in it, so can he do it? This was one of the great candidates for a remake film as the original was far from a classic. And if you do not get into it expecting too much, and turn off the thinking part of your brain to be able to skip the hole of the plot and just get the movie as it is. You will end up enjoying the ride. Watch a double account with "The Fast and the Furious" for a night of high speed, just do not take the car for a spin right after. <br /> <br /> My Note: B - DVD Extras: Jerry Bruckheimer's 7-minute interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight Reel; The great persecution; "0 to 60" featurette; Featurette "Wild Rides"; Stars on the move; The Cult "Painted in the Heart" video clip; Trailer and Trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
