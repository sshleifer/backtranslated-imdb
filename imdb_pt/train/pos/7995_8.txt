Here is a story of revenge, evil face-to-face, starring a relentless and hard Denzel Washington. He has three personalities here: a drunken and exaggerated mercenary, then a loving kind of father to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose looking for answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for an American girl who lives in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the film). He clings to the boy, played victoriously by the child. actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the responsible men and spares no one. Caution: this movie is not for scruples. <br /> <br /> This is an elegant cinematic style, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a lot of people found it too frenetic for their liking, since camera work is something that can cause headaches. I thought it fit the tense storyline and it was fascinating to see, but it is (the camera shaken) not to all tastes. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, there is the always interesting Christopher Walken, in an atypically discreet role, and a host of other actors as well. <br /> <br /> The film favors the basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
