From time to time, the conversation turns into "favorite movies." I will mention the Titanic, and at least some people will laugh. I do not pay attention to them because I know that five years ago these same people were brought to tears by this same film. And they are too embarrassed now to admit it. <br /> <br /> I just remembered the Titanic for the first time in a long time. Hoping to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to discover that the film has not lost any of its power in those five years. I cried again .... in all the same places. This brought me back to 1997, when I remember how a movie that no one thought of a tie would become the most popular movie of all time. A movie that exploded in the public consciousness like no other movie I can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people do not even admit they like it. Guys, let's get something straight - you do not look cool when you say bad things about this movie. You look like a cynical touch. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and this one has some flaws. Some of the dialogues are insignificant and some of the entanglements surrounding the two lovers come together a little too clearly. However, none of this is so disturbing that it spoils the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in Gangs of New York before calling him nothing more than a handsome boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie really was hers, and she kept it fine. <br /> <br /> James Cameron achieved what many believed to be impossible by re-creating a fully believable Titanic. The scenes of the shipwreck were horrible, just like they were that night. How can anyone say that the effects were bad is beyond me. I was completely paralyzed. <br /> <br /> This movie is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack on the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, just ahead!" The bolts hung incredibly out of the ocean. The cries of the damned after she fell. And that ending that took even the most stupid man from the theater to tears. <br /> <br /> Music, which was also a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. Too bad that the pop music version of Celine Dion had to destroy this great piece of music for so many. <br /> <br /> I confess, I'm a Titanic fan. As such, I enjoyed the opportunity to see the ship as we never could see it - in all its beauty. Maybe watching this has affected me more than a few, because I've had so much interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt that many of those I saw crying were Titanic fans. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never diminished the tragedy. The film was made with so much humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it's better than I could ever: Open your hearts to the Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
