This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film was skillfully mounted and presents this disaster as more than a US ground attack. The aftermath of this disaster is predicted in many countries and different perspectives. I believe this film should be more widely distributed to this point. It also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than news about the terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are really funny, but not abusively. This movie was highly recommended to me, and I get the same feeling.
