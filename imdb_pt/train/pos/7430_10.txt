Personnaly I really loved this movie, and it particularly thrilled me. The two main actors are giving us great performances, which in the end, it's really painful to know what finally happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and music is great just the way it is. <br /> <br /> That's why I was not surprised when I learned that I had won five golden globe awards, an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A big movie, which was often criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved in it, certainly as a "co-director"). Your art is the greatest, and it will surely please you!
