Excellent film that reveals how people are connected to common outlets, common accounts exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, this humanizes the workers in China, the factory owner, the accounts dealer in New Orleans and even the New Orleans revelers. What stands out most is the director's ability to tell a complicated story with complicated details so simply and seductively. His incredible access to the factory is another intriguing aspect and I just wanted to know how he got in. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without letting people feel alienated.
