I saw "An American in Paris" on its first release when I was still in school and I fell in love with it immediately. I saw him again the next day and lost count of the number of times I've seen him since the movies and on television. He makes fantastic use of some of the greatest songs and songs of the greatest folk songwriter of the 20th century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male dancers (Gene Kelly) and female dancers (Leslie Caron) in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (as peculiar as ever), Georges Guetary (why did not he make more movies?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an unfriendly role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed for the title track, makes excellent use of the images and sounds of Paris and the images of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "It's very clear" (Caron and Kelly on the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (the children of Paris join Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine "). If you love Paris, watch this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see. But look at this!
