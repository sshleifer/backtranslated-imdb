The most famous horror novelist Cheryl (a solid and friendly performance of the lovely Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the friendly Paolo Serra) and his son Bobby (very well played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the interior of the country . Summer Vacation. Local legend claims the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a horrifying, hairy and unpleasant ogre (David Flosi clumsily in a remarkably hideous costume) who lives in the basement. Cheryl has to overcome her deeply rooted fear of the beast so she can defeat the dirty find. The director / co-writer, Lamberto Bava, does a job specializing in creating and sustaining a mysterious and disturbing nightmare climate. In addition, Bava avoids the standard routine of the blood-fright movie in favor of creating a fable that looks like a dark and convincing adult fairy tale about how the best way to overcome what frightens us is to face the fountain in front. Resistant turns of support by Sabrina Ferilli as a teacher friend of the Anna school, Stefania Montorsi as a loving nanny Maria, and Alex Serra as a Baptist painter Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's brilliant cinematography has some fluid tracking shots and lots of great atmospheric lighting. Fabr√≠cio Sforza's scrawny makeup, Simon Boswell's Scottish Spooky'n'shuddery, and the damp, dark, cobwebbed basement reached the point of shivering skin. It's worth watching.
