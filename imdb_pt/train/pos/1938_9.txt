The big bad swim has a low budget, indie feel about it. So many times I start watching independent films that have had great reviews only to find out they are pretentious, voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the movie and its potential to be provocative that they forget that the movie is a form of entertainment first place. <br /> <br /> I do not know if The Great Bad Swim has any message or meaning or larger metaphor, if it does, then I missed it. From the beginning BBS felt good, it was easy and warm and humane, there were no important dramas or significant insights, I just connected with the characters immediately. And when, as in all good movies, the ending came, I felt sadness over the loss of that connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big, fast or insightful, look for a movie trying to deliver more than it can. The BBS offers a solid, enjoyable and real experience, and I felt rewarded and pleased to have watched.
