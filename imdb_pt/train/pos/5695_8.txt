Some movies can survive almost in originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything in an almost feverish tone, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not chosen to cover up a weak script, but rather to accurately reflect the reality addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> As director, James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. Most of the characters are perpetually on the edge, and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a cheater, capable of manipulating and controlling. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak in spirit. However, it is an impressive performance. Comparing this to Kilmer's more "Hollywood" roles, as in "The Saint," it seems to prove that he is much more comfortable with independent films. <br /> <br /> Actors are the main force that holds everyone together. There are several small performances that stand out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have limited screen time alongside their male counterparts, but all are fantastic. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a strange and impressive energy to their roles. I originally postponed watching "Wonderland" because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actor in the strictest of movies. sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this movie is a murder mystery, and as such - it is excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 out of 10
