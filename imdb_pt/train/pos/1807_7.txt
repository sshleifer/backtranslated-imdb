This is one of the first movies I remember, or maybe the first. Exactly the kind of beautiful movie that introduces a child, sweetly, into the world of violence and addictions we live in. A little bit of Babe, Casino and Constantine, all mixed well in a box, and we got it. I do not know if it's really rated for children, but I think it was really cool, very funny and interesting. I hate it when a movie (spescially a box) can have a good ending and its ruin, because every character should have a happy ending, even though it seems strange (I'm not a bitter person). But that was OK, it just goes to the sky and they leave like this. <br /> <br /> All this is just a critic, it's a good movie and something new. very touching and I have to go
