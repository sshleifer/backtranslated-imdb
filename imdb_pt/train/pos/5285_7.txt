You would think that you would like to do some serious tours when the premise of the movie occurs mainly between two characters while they travel 3,000 miles or more from France to Saudi Arabia, passing through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey , before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stops for immersion in the sights. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the Haj. However, since riding and carrying the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can not drive and therefore asks Reda for help, to protest his son, to take him there in his broken vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see the point of having him go along. when his father could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of ​​putting his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he could not understand. And so we set off on this arduous journey with father and son, not being best friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is witnessing the development of the parent and child couple, the challenges they face. face, the strange people they encounter, having to fight in varying climatic conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap trying to communicate with one another, the father trying to impose himself on the son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but the circumstances we see reveal that Reda is a fish out of water. . Through the many encounters, they really come together very well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that this film was released last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and have the opportunity to watch our protagonists. join the other pilgrims in your Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you would also feel claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt her father out of the thousands of people gathered. Europe's sights might not have been deliberately contemplated, in order to build anticipation and focus on final destination. <br /> <br /> Surely you have called home the idea of ​​telling and showing your loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Do not miss this, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that the sitting this evening was still a full house.
