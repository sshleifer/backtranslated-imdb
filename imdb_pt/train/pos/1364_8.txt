I remember Parker Posey in "The World Turns" before becoming the queen of independent films. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a first-rate actress. In this supporting cast film that includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street who aspires to become a teacher. The supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and family only as Judy, the librarian who is old-fashioned, dedicated and menopausal. Posey as Mary learns that she has to grow and mature. Losing her position as a librarian makes her realize how much she misses her as a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village in New York, before becoming gentrified with yuppies. This movie is very good for an independent and I have been enjoying Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters in other films.
