This film took me beyond understanding, is and will continue to be my favorite movie of all time, mainly because it has almost all the emotions in its 157 minutes. What's the hardest part for me is that whenever I want to hear the amazing music and songs from the movie, I have to put it on my DVD player, so I wanted to know if anyone somewhere knows who sings the songs on the film and where they can be found, as I looked everywhere, I can think sporadically in the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the film is when in court the lawyer says, "But your own words call for direct confrontation, is not it a direct call to violence?" Biko responds, "Well, you and I are in a confrontation now, but I do not see violence !!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
