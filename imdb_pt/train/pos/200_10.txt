Updated from a previous review. The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her comic material in this year-end comedy (1928) which also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies is a Georgia hick, who hits Hollywood with the help of Haines, a player in raw comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great lampa in Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and guests of such films as Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Joy Leatrice, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Ren√©e Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you have to see) are a joke. A must for any serious movie fan or anyone interested in the yet defamed Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the main viscous man. <br /> <br /> SHOW PEOPLE would have used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film parallels Swanson's rise from single-reel Mack Sennett to Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille's late-teens and early 20s films. <br /> <br /> Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Strange that MGM never got together on a talkie. They're great together! A sweet romance and a delicious parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but they do not appear.
