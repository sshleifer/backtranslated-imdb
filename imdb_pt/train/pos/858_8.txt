This film has a rotten core of flexible morality and yet a peculiar sense of justice. Many of the common Joes among us would love to "stick in the MAN". The "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports in his office. Later, Paul owes 70,000 to Mr. Marchand, the owner of the club. And then there's Paul's probation officer. There seems to be a lot of doubt about the story of the last character. Analysts point to this as a weakness in an underground game of ping pong that has been well worked out between the two protagonists, increasing the odds until their lives change dramatically. They are due to every "MAN" agent. One or both may be dismissed, killed or arrested if they do not do what they are told. <br /> <br /> The film has a sense of relief in the end. Carla finally fucks. Your boss is forced to be an idiot. Mr. Club Owner is a mess in his own bathroom. They earn $$. And ... they do not have to worry about reporting to the parole officer, because his moral weakness leads him to hide his errant wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). It is a critical subconscious trigger for the locking tumbler that hurt us so tight. It does not matter that another person can take Paul's file later to supervise his release; they are free for now! They can even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They Put Him To The Man!
