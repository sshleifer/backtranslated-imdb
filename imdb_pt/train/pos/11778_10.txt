This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and makes even more sense from the author's later work, Collapse. <br /> <br /> Diamond himself is an attractive and caring character, not just a disinterested or disinterested scholar. This series makes it clear that his book was not only a response to the need to "publish or perish," as the academic dictum says, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects: "Why did you white people get so much burden , and we have so little? "As he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond sought a response that did not insult this intelligence or that community. I like to think of your answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as South Park's "Blame Canada": "Guilt of Wheat!"
