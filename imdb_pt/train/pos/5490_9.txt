This is really an amazing movie. Not only does it document the timeless struggle of indigenous and underprivileged peoples to get their voice in law, but it also shows the United States for its dishonesty, subterfuge and flagrant disrespect for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very courageous and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers recorded a different blow from all that has been witnessed before. <br /> <br /> And in the sights we see the USA, once again pulling the strings and obscuring the whole sense of reality. It is heartfelt to see the early stages of the uprising, knowing full well that the subversion of democracy we are witnessing is a tool long used by successive US governments and their seemingly blind citizens. Filming makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic images, but an active documentation of a people and their government fighting for their future. Truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live the Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to enshrine the notion that each country should be able to choose its government and develop in ways that the majority deems appropriate. The first stage of this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary does a great job of doing that.
