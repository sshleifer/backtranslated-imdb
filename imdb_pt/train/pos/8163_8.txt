Corbin Bernsen delivers an incredibly intense and fascinating performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is obsessed with perfection. When he finds out that his lovely blonde wife is cheating on him and the IRS starts chasing him about tax problems, Feinstone breaks the pressure and goes violently around the bend. Director Brian Yuzna, working from a suitably somber, witty and demented script by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli, and Charles Finch, exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling beneath the clean, well-cared surface of the respectful and rich America with delightfully joyous malicious. In addition, Yuzna spices the horrible things even more with a perversely distorted sense of black humor. Bernsen shines positively as Dr. Feinstone; he deftly designs a frightening and frightening underlying weakness that is well beneath Feinstone's seemingly calm and assured veneer. The supporting cast is also excellent: Linda Hoffman as Feinstone's unfaithful wife, Brooke, Earl Boen as marionette agent, meddlesome Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as the lively assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as the cheerful assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as the office manager Candy, Virginya Keehne as sweet and clumsy teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs's equally insightful partner, Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as Matt Garland, and Mark Ruffalo as Steve Landers. The first-line makeup f / x is as bloody, coarse and disturbing as it should be. The cinematography polished by Levie Isaaks has many incredible camera angles and some close-ups of zoom. The witty score of Alan Howarth also reaches the point of crawling out of the flesh. A pleasantly deformed delight.
