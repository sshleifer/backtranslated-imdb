If you are a fan of the great cast of Altman, as evidenced in such great films as M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park and smaller films such as A Wedding, then you will undoubtedly have fun with HealtH. Centered around a health convention where two women run for president, HealtH contains many of the 1970s Altman regulars, including Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, and include newcomers as Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman films, there are numerous subplots in this film, but it's not as impressive as films like Nashville or A Wedding, but rather a more centered feel, perhaps as M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is an obvious satire on the Health movement, full of strange, unfamiliar and contradictory characters, with guests like Dick Cavett giving an ironic comment on the whole thing. Underlining the entire election process is Altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal, but what is most appealing about this movie is the sheer fun that most people seem to be having. This would be one of the last Altman films so for a while!
