"Der Todesking" - the second feature film by Jorg Buttgereit (the first was notorious "Nekromantik") has no central character or characters, but rather thematic continuity in the act of suicide. Divided into days of the week, it is composed of a series of pieces, each with the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, production figures are low and disturbing, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is extremely effective. Makes you think that sometimes it's more important than pure entertainment. Unlike Buttgereit's works, it's not very bloody, but there are some nasty pictures like the castration scene in Tuesday's episode, a decaying corpse and several acts of suicide. The last (Sunday) episode is so depressing and full of pain! - Incredible if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 - check out this postmodern shock! Disturbing art in the purest form!
