This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. He also received an Oscar for best photography and deservedly. I have many movies in my collection of movies and several others that I have seen beyond them, and not many of them are more beautiful or equally as beautifully as this. <br /> <br /> It is unique and a great success movie. The cast is fantastic and does a great job of portraying your characters. We follow their destinies with devotion and we become very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot about this movie for what it represents and how it is presented. I strongly recommend
