At age 50, this musical comedy fantasy may seem her age, but she uses it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still a lot of fun. Crosby has never been a romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the slightly humorous edge he needs. Bendix interprets broadly and is a lot of fun in a part that appeals to his strengths. Hardwicke - what a joy to a knight of the realm - genuine - throw yourself in traps like this with such abandon. And Rhonda Fleming revels in the less showy of the lead roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints as a little convincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although not a musical, the songs are very good, and the "dance" routine that goes with "Busy Doing Nothing" is perfect - funny, appropriate, agile without being challenging. and making a virtue of Crosby's musical movement that, to be fair, was intrinsically fun because it was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sound is a bit muddy in some places. And the story - well, it takes some liberties with the original, but I suspect Mr. Clemens might very well have been pleased with the outcome.
