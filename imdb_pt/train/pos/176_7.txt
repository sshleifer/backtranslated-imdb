CARE WITH SPOILERS. This movie was cool. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the two best. Okay, so the crazy alien guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. The boss of this guy was good too. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had much more time on the screen together. They are chemistry was great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a coquettish waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up in the white house in the middle of a plot due to the greed of the politicians. To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy that satisfies both the political and the romantic side. She touches on political issues and barely touches on romantic areas. <br /> <br />
