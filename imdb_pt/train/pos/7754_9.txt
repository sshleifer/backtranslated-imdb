Any Way the Wind Blows is the debut movie Tom Barmans (which is also known as the frontman of rock formation 'dEUS'). Filmed entirely in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on a sunny Friday morning and skims superficially between events that fill the day with a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have a lot of things to think about, because most of the different stories are left open. <br /> <br /> The movie has a soundtrack (purely instrumental) socks off. In most scenes, the music actually improves the overall mood and makes the movie hallucinate to watch at certain times. The main scene of the movie, the party, is very well filmed. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, having his main characters dancing on one of the best soundtracks I've ever seen. heard lately. <br /> <br /> The script is great. Angles and camera colors are very well chosen. The 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventy' too. And I loved (most) acting. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that interspersed. <br /> <<br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is another directorial debut that should not be an ending. I hope to see more Tom Barman films in the future because I had so much fun. Cheers.
