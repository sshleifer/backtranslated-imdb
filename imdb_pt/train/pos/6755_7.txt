Ah, noir My favorite genre. Otto Preminger's sequel to "Laura" is a post-war New York-style noir film where corruption and violence run rampant. Starring Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics put him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to lay the blame on the crime boss, Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he engages with the dead man's wife, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in typical noir style, things fall fast. <br /> <br /> While the film does nothing interesting in camera or narrative, it has a constant tone of dread and melancholy. Like most great noirs, it is also wonderfully stimulating, sucking the viewer from the start. <br /> <br /> Still, like most of Preminger's working films, it's not something I would ever see again. He lacks Wilder's verbal intelligence, Hitchcock's visual exuberance, or Welles's spatial experimentation. Like Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" seems very much a "clone" of what a noir should be, rather than something genuinely truly artistic. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is nothing special. It's about a police officer who is slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his own father was a little time bandit, the movie flirting with the notion of predestination, but this scene is as far as Otto goes, or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is equally disappointing. There is no intelligence on Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign the camera to anything. Does not play with space or architecture or emphasizes step-by-step police procedure. It's just a tripod with occasional dolly in and out. No sense, though most people do not mind these things. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a good shot where our hero is trapped in a gangster car (cage noir) that goes into a vehicle lift (another cage) and is taken inside the boss the gangster. lair. As Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Otto re-tropics the film, he constantly compares "upstairs" to hell. This works well, but the design of the set can not reinforce it. Otto seems content to follow the hawksian mold than a noir is, instead of playing around with the possibilities of where the noir can go. Like "Deviance", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In a Lonely Place", "Violence Act", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Anxious", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is one of those well made films second-level noirs. He is competent and engaging but does not have that extra special magic.
