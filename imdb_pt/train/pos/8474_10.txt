I saw this movie when I was 13 and I really enjoyed the dish, which later starred in different traits like Kimmond Drummond. I do not think it's crap. It was not meant to be a continuation of the documentary as well. it's just a cute children's movie about 3 kids going after men trying to find the monster marshy brook. the men get hurt and the children rescue them with the help of the creature. The arkansas marsh and scenery scenes were perfect. this is a good movie for children, without real violence, some slight scares, but good fun for young people.
