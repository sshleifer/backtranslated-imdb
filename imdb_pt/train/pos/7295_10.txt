I got to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We are both very impressed with the complexity of the plot and find that it is moving emotionally. It was very well run with strong pictures. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short time. He had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: This movie is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise in the end that caught me off guard. This leans towards the gothic feel. I would love to see this as a complete movie. Carrie
