Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the biggest game ever created. It's so addictive that you could touch it for hours and hours without stopping for a break. I won the game 4 times, but I never got all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to reach them eventually. Even though I did not officially play this game until I was seven, I loved to see my sisters playing. Now I'm 13 and still playing, deleting games and starting over again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are unbelievable for one of the first games of the N64. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. Levels are difficult, but not impossible. Bowser's fights are challenging. <br /> <br /> I'd like to tell you more, but why do not you do it? Put the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii away and find a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing and wonderful game.
