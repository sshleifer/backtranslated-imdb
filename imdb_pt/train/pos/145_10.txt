The continuation of the "Kingdom" is more bloody and even more distorted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and could not sit through all 5 1/2 hours), but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutant babies, voodoo ... this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like strange movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> In addition, you do not need to see Part 1 to understand this ... you will find out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theater is tiring. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there probably will not be a "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after being filmed. But you never know!
