I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow got it, but seeing it again will remind you what all the fuss about Mrs. Paltrow was in the first place! I had long since left the woman and still feel she is quite boring in her Oscar-winning "Shakespeare in Love" performance, but she gets all the beats around here - she's almost perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but she must be remembered for it. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by a large support cast including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and others ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive as the love interest, even though the script sinks a little in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all tension to escape his relationship); several years later, Ewan's hair is a little easier to pick up than it was in 96, and personally I find the grumpy Alan Cumming an irritating presence on anything nowadays. But the highlight is undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; What this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss. Bates, since she is the character to whose destiny we are attracted. The movie is worth watching (again even) for its performance alone. <br /> <br /> All in all, this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to solve the British class system. It's worth renting (because Paltrow is unlikely to be that good again - but we'll always have Emma).
