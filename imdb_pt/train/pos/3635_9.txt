This is a great Disney movie. It's the story of an old high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who has been on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered a late-career injury.But through a series of Jimmy Morris (Quaid) auditions with a major league team and even does the cast. This is a great family movie. It's inspiring, but it's not very thick. It's fun and fun. Adults will enjoy this movie well. as kids.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure the filmmakers had some liberties in telling the story.Quaid is sensational as the title character, very convincing.If you're looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy , look no further.9 / 10
