It was originally meant to be a movie that Gene Kelly would star in, but when the makers failed to catch him, they got "the greatest actor in the world", and the result is very good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is having trouble doing what he does best by setting up a crappy dice game because he needs $ 1000 to get the place. So in order to get the money he needs, he bets $ 1000 with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) to not get Sergeant Sarah Brown (Golden Globe winner and Jean Simmons nominated for BAFTA) to go with him . Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan is having a hard time getting rid of the woman who wants him to marry her, Miss. Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Jule. An interesting romantic comedy musical, with Brando singing all his own songs, and Sinatra being smooth and cool. He was nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Picture, Best Costume and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, was named the BAFTA for Best Film from Any Source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was the number 43 in the 100 best pop culture icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 in the top 100 movie stars, he was number 11 on the 100 greatest sex symbols, he was number 4 in 100 years, 100 stars - men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was number 1 in The Greatest Actor in the World, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 in 100 Years, 100 Songs for, the movie was number 23 in 100 Years of Musicals , and was number 36 in 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!
