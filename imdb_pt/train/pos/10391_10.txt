It is very rare for a movie to attract viewers of all ages - for children, for a good narrative and a wonderful and colorful production, and for adults, for a literate script, good production values, good cast / performance, all linked together a good Rozsa score. Two more or less contemporary films do this - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some of the background stories of this production are fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and proved to be a cover for the efforts of British intelligence! The producer, Alexander Korda, was later knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of the intersection between art, trade and politics! By all means, ensure a good CD of this movie for your library!
