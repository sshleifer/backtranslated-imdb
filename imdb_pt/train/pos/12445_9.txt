I've seen this movie and I must say I'm very impressed. There are not many movies that I like, but I like this one. You should see this movie alone and comment on it, because this is one of my favorite movies. I like to see it again. Action merged with a fantastic story. Very impressive. I like the character of Modesty. In fact it is very mystical and mysterious (I like it ^ ^). The bad boy is handsome too. Well, actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld'. I considered about the vote in this movie, I thought this is a very popular movie. I think it's wrong. It was ME who was very impressed with this movie, and hopefully not the only one that only takes the cost to watch this. Watch and vote.
