I saw this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best damn baseball ever." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end, but you have a great time to get there. The training scenes are very funny, but the best scene may be the one where Jack and Reno are trying to watch the game Falcons vs. Vikings Monday Night Football as they try to make a make-up dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this and it's a shame that it's forgotten as a top-notch comedy.
