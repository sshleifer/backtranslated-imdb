Let me set the scene. It's school holidays and there's absolutely nothing in the movies. I'm with my friend deciding what to see. We look for a movie that is starting soon and "The Grinch" appears. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we got was a fun roller coaster. Jim Carrey (which I can add is my first actor in the world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this best Ron Howard movie (next to Apollo 13). The way this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was incredible. I really brought this movie from childhood to life. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of the smile. As we all know, the Grinch is a horrible person who simply does not support Christmas. He lives well above the whoville and has never mixed well with the people of the city. But a little girl will change the look of Grinch on life and on others in a drastic way. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by the lovely actress Taylor Momsem) knows Grinch as the gentle part of him immediately. She tries to break the barrier and help the Grinch to come in and mingle with the people of the city. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is a barrel of laughter for the whole family, both children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
