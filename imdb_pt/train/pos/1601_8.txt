It is a simple movie, not very active, but very charming. There were times when I could see why Cher won the Best Actress Oscar, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close did not win by Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winner and BAFTA nominee Cher are playing Loretta Castorini, a simple, low-paid woman who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to to marry him. He promises her that she will return in a month, since her mother is sick, so she means, as long as she needs to get as much of her family as possible to go to the wedding. The only problem is that when she meets Ronny (the Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), a brother without Johnny, they begin to have a relationship, and there love goes to that scene from the moon (from where the title comes from). Also starring at the Oscar Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without marriage to Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay, Written Directly for Screen, and was nominated for Best Director by Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, was nominated for BAFTA for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay. He was number 96 in 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Snap out of it!"), He was number 17 in 100 Years, 100 Passions, and was number 41 in 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!
