Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I had. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - lots of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the history of Herge and his development of Tintin. The filmmaker's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired the character Chan were very touching. <br /> <br /> A great documentary of a very talented and beloved artist. . A great example of someone who has become internationally recognized and has brought joy to millions of children (and young people in spirit) around the world.
