The Somerset Maugham characters are brought to life in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; but the film is a very skeletal version of the novel, with the performance of Bette Davis starring all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but is said to have no talent for the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard struggles, instead, to become a doctor. Their efforts seem to indicate some bad advice about the arts; although successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - also, note the symbolism of his disability, a "club foot" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> Along the way (immediately in this version) Howard falls in love with the waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis's characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells Howard, among other things, that she had to "wipe his mouth!" after kissing him. Howard also performs well, but the story does not explain his extended fascination and love for Davis; so their performances are wasted. <br /> <br /> Still, a movie to watch the acting, including some good support players. The characterization of Bette Davis was famous for inspiring an "write-in" campaign for the Oscar for Best Actress in 1934. For the record, she came in third. The results were: 1. Claudette Colbert - "A Night Has Happened" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "From Human Slavery" 4. Grace Moore - "A Night of Love" ******* From Human Slavery (6 / 28/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
