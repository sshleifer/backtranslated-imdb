The 74th Oscar was very good. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very funny and light. I personally loved his last appearance, which received some cold criticism due to gross language and indecent jokes, but that's okay. The audience seemed to like this. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier made it to the Oscars. <br /> <br />
