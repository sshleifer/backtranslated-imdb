One measure for the greatness of a movie is: 'If it came in t.v. now, would you like to sit there and watch it again?' My response to the Grand Canyon is a "yes" as powerful as it would be for almost every movie I've ever seen. There are so many powerful moments, such a clever and moving story, incredible performances. <br /> <br /> It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that was so rampant in the early nineties. But it also dramatically affirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care. In a light, the film was of his time. In part it portrays society as a balloon about to explode. Because the country was in recession, and so empty of leadership, that was true at the time. But the film is also timeless. I think I could honestly stand up against any film that has already been made, and it's the most overlooked film of all time.
