I watched this last night with low expectations. The reasons are, I do not usually like "made-for-TV" movies and rarely enjoyed "casting" movies. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed to like this, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did. Was very good. Adam West and Burt Ward get together like they do. But in a way, they were acting like their "Batman and Robin" selves. They were being exaggerated and not taking themselves seriously, or this movie very seriously. The film begins with them looking for the Batmobile designed by George Barris, that someone stole before being auctioned to the house of an orphan. While, they are looking for the car, they are also reminiscing about the series that they made together. This is counted in flashback. It was well done. The actors they received, for young Burt Ward and Adam West, were dead. And for a TV movie, it summed up the essentials about its actual behavior on and off the screen. I give this a 9/10, I really liked it.
