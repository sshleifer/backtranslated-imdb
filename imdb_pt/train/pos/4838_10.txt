This movie reminded me that some old Black & White movies are definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> Initially I had some reservations, however from the beginning of the movie to the end I was captivated. I was very impressed by the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and put me on points all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this movie to your movie night for a little relief from the sometimes depressing and "very" powerful or overly "funny" movies of today.
