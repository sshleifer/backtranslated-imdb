I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best films of 'National Lampoon', it also has a very captivating title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about .... Men In White !!!! The story is a parody of many movies, including a Will Smith movie, as you may have guessed: "Men In Black." I'm not going to give up on the end, but it has a very good ending, it's very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humor) from start to finish, especially a little close to the start, when you're out in the street picking up trash cans ). In addition, they also have a really nice Garbage Collecting Truck in that scene. The acting is not superb, in fact, it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, relax !! I love the plot, partly because it's so unlikely and partly because it's interesting to see how subtle (or it should be non-subtle) they rip all the other movies. I'm a big fan of fake movies, but I'm also a fan of the real thing, and with these movies, it's hard to decide which one is the best, the movie that rips (mentioned earlier, this review) or the actual movie is, but also when you're actually making a parody of comedy movies actually makes it even harder, but this movie performs successfully. The two garbage collectors are so funny, it reminds me of a UK TV show called 'Little Britain'. This film is mandatory for your collection and is one of the best, funniest, funniest, best stories, the National Lampoon movie to date !!
