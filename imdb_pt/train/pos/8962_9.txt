As a pagan, I must say that this movie has little or no magical significance. It's a "fun" witchery movie and it's not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magic of all, and never use it in a controlling or vengeful way. This is a lesson that everyone needs to learn, not just pagans. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is beautifully written and sweetly performed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. Hermione Gingold has a stellar performance, since Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with many credits in films to mention except Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was wonderful as Queenie, the neighbor of Novak, distracted and able to take the stage. Also starring Jack Lemmon (marvelous performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly witty). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry, but they can not shed a single tear because their hearts are full of Magic, they do not have time for silly things like love." <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and his brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are wizards in Manhattan. Wrapped deep in the secret underworld of those of Art, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without even causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then comes Pastor Shep Henderson (Stewart), a dedicated, honest, dedicated business man who is engaged to a former college rival to Gillian. <br /> <br /> By a peculiar chance chance, he finds himself moving into Gillian's building and is instantly "bewitched" by his charm and grace. With the use of Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (familiar from Gillian, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian starts working on this beautiful new dream man to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magic should never be used to control, nor to hurt, and Gillian learns it the hard way in the most bittersweet way. Not only does she have to face what she did, but she has to face Shep in her guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical perspective; however, the film takes a serious turn: the effects are too old to be pure. Part of the scene was apparently filmed in the basement of someone's little house, but at least the characters were quirky and funny. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Great cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. As a Note of Curiosities, this is the root of the beloved Bewitched television sitcom. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All note characters are present and are counted. You just have to look, to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites, and I watch it often. <br /> <br /> This movie earns a 9.1 / 10. .. the devil:.
