This movie is funny !!! The acting is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle and the plot is exactly what every high school student dreams of doing for their school. I simply loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you will love this movie. This movie is a little "greasy" esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are pleasing; you might even find yourself singing these songs as soon as the movie is over. This musical occupies number two in musicals for me (second to the side of the blues brothers). But please do not think of it as a musical by word; seeing how nice the songs are, it's hard to say that a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. I think of this movie as more of a comedy with tones of romance. You will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after watching this movie. Highly recommended both for the family (since it is very young but also for adults as there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience.
