When this movie was first released in 1984, Prince was one of the most popular artists in the world. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extended video clip. The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians performing on the big screen for the first time? Despite this, it was still a very fun movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer some classic comedy of all time, especially the version of "The Password," which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their "who's first" baseball routine. Appolina (who went through a single name, then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered. Besides, she's very attractive. And, of course, the album's soundtrack is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later had a fall with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie is not rated at all time great category, but it is a lot of fun.
