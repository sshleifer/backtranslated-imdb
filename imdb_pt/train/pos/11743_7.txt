Although this was not without its flaws, this drama was appropriate to be shown at the time of Easter. This reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was much to enjoy in the drama, not least, the teenagers who gave a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor soundtrack in the background. The performance was excellent and Timothy Spall was again superb. The climax was very satisfying, albeit simplistic. Timothy Spall's "letting go" of the suicide of his long-dead wife was creditworthy and well mirrored the feelings of despair that were present in the teenager who was hurt. The resolution between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was gratifying, but less credible. A wonderful drama that left me and my husband feeling that the night had been well spent. Congratulations!
