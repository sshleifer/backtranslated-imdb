While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not animated version), I think it still fell a little short of what Disney could do. It was well filmed, the music was more fit for action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better, but the human characters were given much more appropriate roles in this sequence, and Glenn Close should not be lost, as in the first film. It makes you shine. Your poor footman and the super-zealous furry companions are wonderful characters to enjoy, and they contribute to the show that Disney has given us. This is a great family movie, with little or no objectionable material, yet it's still fun and interesting for adults and kids alike. It's bound to be a classic, as so many Disney movies are. Here's the hope that the third one is even better, because you know they probably want to make one. ;)
