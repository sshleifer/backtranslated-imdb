This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I've never seen an ad or a trailer so I did not know that Clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole cast was adequate and found the film quite nice, though. The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road, looking whipped and beaten, caught my attention immediately. I had a way of saying to you, "do not go away, this will not be boring," and it really was not. It turned out to be an interesting and light comedy, with enough twists to keep it in place until the end, but by the end it came, I felt a little cheated ... just a little bit. The events kept increasing so you expect them to continue building, but at a point I can not define, it's kind of level, making the ending a bit disappointing. I guess I expected a bigger crash of a climax, but it ended up kind of discreet. If you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this movie very entertaining and worth watching. Now I'd like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
