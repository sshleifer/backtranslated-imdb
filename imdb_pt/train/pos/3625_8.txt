This is the best picture on baseball since Redford killed The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to take you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Tied to dreams - dripping in reality, the American dream reigns after 9:11 with a true story about the devil's middle-aged rookie Ray, Jimmy Morris. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths plays a West Texan native better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection? cast as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It's real. The chemistry of the screen works. If you like baseball heaters, you'll love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all there. My popcorn became the "a la mode" mode. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! The music rocks and carries the story magnificently! Synchronizing words and music pushes the story forward exactly as it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would have given the ball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about character and heart. Santa Rita and the nuns were a beautiful decoration, but they never found a place in history to open and close around them. A little long worth every minute in the final analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
