I do not know why some people criticize the program so much. <br /> <br /> It's a big, funny show - it's probably not the right stuff for the mainstream, but still ... <br /> <br /> The family dynamics are funny and, in general, it is the same we see in most comedy shows. Supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The storylines of the individual episodes and the frequent insinuations of Siegfried and Roy are just a little above average, but often you have subplots or effect phrases that make you roll on the floor, laughing. <br /> <br /> Show was worth the 8 pounds I paid for it. <br /> <br /> rating: 8/10
