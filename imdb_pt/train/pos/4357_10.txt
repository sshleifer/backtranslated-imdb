I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was very well done, from cinematography to acting. It is the story of father and son and how they appreciate each other during a family crisis. Wonderfully written with dialogues that never sound fake, the film shows the talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this outstanding cast. The film begins with the elderly father (Peter Falk) trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) abandoned him. The father appears, without warning, at the door of his son and daughter-in-law. The father and the son leave the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic trip. They fish, play pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get into bar fights and dance with strange women. But more importantly, each of them faces the unvoiced tensions that can affect any family. It's the kind of movie that touches the heart and makes you appreciate those who are closest to them.
