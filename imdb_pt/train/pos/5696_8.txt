What do you do with a 14-inch porn star who was involved in drugs and murders and died of AIDS? You make a movie, of course. The likely reason this has not been done previously is the fact that Eddie Nash would be on the path of his production. So it's no coincidence that the film was made shortly after Nash was sent to jail. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its fast pace. No time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would that be? There is a lot of good stuff here to require dull fill scenes. The cast is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a number of films, so here was finally a quite suitable role for him. Bosworth is cute, so it's irrelevant how she acts (she's solid), and McDermott, who is very annoying, is very good, largely because he's wearing both his facials I did not recognize him at first. (I wish they would do it with Cruise in all the movies so I did not have to watch your dumb face.) I completely failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and I would not have known she was in it if I had not seen the name her in the final credits. Kudrow is charming as always, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom ever.) The only casting choices that were questionable were a brief approach to Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of Janeane Garofalo's 90's idiot. You thought I'd include Paris Hilton too, did not you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb prostitute. Why the film is about decadence, among other things? and about a porn actor? it fits perfectly.
