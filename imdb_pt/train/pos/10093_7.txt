A beautiful London shopper is taken by the owners of a million-dollar tea plantation and soon finds herself married and living with him in her villa in British Ceylon. Although based on Robert Standish's book, this initial setup is very reminiscent of Hitchock's "Rebecca," starring Elizabeth Taylor clashing with the mansion's imposing team leader and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his father deceased, but dominant. Taylor, a late replacement for a sick Vivien Leigh, looks creamy in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; however, once her husband Peter Finch begins to drink heavily and barks orders to her, one might think that his dedication to him is a bit masochistic (that feeling also makes it difficult to end). Still, the film offers an unforgettable lot for soap fans: romantic drama, a bit of travel diary, interpretive dance, an elephant burst and a perfectly timed cholera outbreak! *** in ****
