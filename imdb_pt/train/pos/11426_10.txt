I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as an image of colonial Africa in the 1950s and 1960s instead of a story. Because there is no real history here. Just one vignette on top of the other, like little dots of light that do not mean much until you have enough to paint an image. The first time I saw Chocolat I did not really "get it" until I had thought about it for a few days. Then I realized that there were many things to "catch on", including the end of colonialism that was just around the corner, just without plot. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene at the airport with the brief bath and the beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, do not watch it - you'll be bored to tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
