My girlfriend and I have one thing for robots. So I try to look for movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big ones. They beat the clang and beat each other, with the fate of the nations in the balance. It is very cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his team of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It's very hard not to like this movie. Because of these big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional fighters! That made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. And a special mention must be made to the veteran actor Paul Koslo: as the maniac Villain Russo if he is mercilessly trampling his defenseless opponents after they have already surrendered or complaining that his closeness to him in a bar made his vodka taste " as the blood "(a line he delivers with a deliciously exaggerated accent sub-Bela Lugosi) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits greatly whenever he is on the screen. This is a cool little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
