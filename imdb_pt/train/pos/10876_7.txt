I was very excited to see this movie. I thought at last Australia made a good movie ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt at a horror movie of all time. I'm sorry for Molly Ringwald having to come all the way to Australia to make a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible (especially that Australian who was trying to speak with an American accent), and the plot was also very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this movie coming out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the "Stab" cheese movie in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> WARNING !!! IMPORTANT SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the ending. I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was ... but the killer was neither human ... which turned this realistic movie into a horrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
