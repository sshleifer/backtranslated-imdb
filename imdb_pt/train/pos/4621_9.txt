Considering all teen movies like "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty In Pink", we are lionized. It is surprising that this is so ignored. <br /> <br /> There is no sex in it, but sex is thought, including the idea that it can import what others think about it. Children do not always get along well with their parents, but neither parents nor children are seen as always right or wrong, and parents are not seen as monsters. <br /> <br /> It deals with hero worship. Like a girl does a dangerous thing, which could lead to a real dust, before realizing that she was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film is a little ahead of its time. A boy asks another boy what birth control she uses. She says she's not doing anything to need birth control. She responds (erroneously) to "oral sex."
