I was having the worst day of my life. So I stumbled into this cute movie, watched it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a street lamp. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I only watched for 2 reasons: LEGA DE VERA-ELLEN. But it's really much more. The plot is actually quite intelligent and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its delicious misunderstandings. And, of course, there is also ... LEGA DE VERA-ELLEN. <br /> <br /> The only pitiful aspect of this movie is that the version I bought (Mill Creek Entertainment's "100 Family Classics" collection) does not have the best video quality, and I heard the same about the release of Alpha. The brightness and contrast are a little too high, so many scenes look discolored, especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can touch the controls on the TV to compensate. I can only imagine how it got on the big screen in 1951. Scenarios, costumes and colors are dazzling and chilling - in a vein of "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet." <br /> <br /> When it comes to romance, this is just perfect. Not sappy, not invented, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. What a shame, poor poor people, their miserable lives will never be as lovely as this. Har har har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life is as bad as yours. Oh hell. Time to watch this movie again.
