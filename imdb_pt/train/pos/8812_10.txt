I saw this series when it premiered world-wide at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the movie where two men got together and told one director from each country to direct a movie about 911. These directors never met before the project was complete, and they saw how everything looked together . WARNING: AHEAD SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial. If you are an American, then you may not like this, as some of the pieces can be found as anti-American. However, I know some Americans who liked these series. The piece I found the best was from India. It was about how a Muslim family, living in the United States, had two children and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed he was connected to the terrorist bombing. It captures the despair and humiliation of the mother of these accusations so well, that brought tears to my eyes. In the end, we see that his son died trying to save the many victims of the crash of the towers. This was a true story, and that's what made it so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was comical but as powerful as the others. A must see for everyone, and hopefully America will undo this, and let it play in your country.
