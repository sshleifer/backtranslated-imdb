Gray Gardens was fascinating and crazy and you just could not look away. It was so strange and funny and sad and sick and ?????? .. really no words can describe. The Gray Gardens movement is very bizarre. I found out about this movie by reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader by the Institute of the Bathroom and it was well worth the rent and hit the top of my queue to watch movies. This movie is about the most eccentric people ever filmed. One should watch their favorite Edie outfits, which I'm sure will include curtains. When I grow old, I almost want to be like Big Edie, moving my nose in normality and society.
