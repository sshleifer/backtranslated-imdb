The story of a wanderer, his sheep farm boss and the boss's daughter is not to everyone's taste, but it is still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the scenery we know so well through other films of this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I saw the excellent Mary. Regan, and I've been a fan of her ever since. The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably most remembered by the American audience of the movie "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper makes an uproar as a ranch owner who pays a little of the wrong kind of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> He acted acutely, with unforgettable performances from all his leaders. I first saw this movie extremely heavily edited on late night television here in America, but believe me, the unexpurgated version is not to be missed.
