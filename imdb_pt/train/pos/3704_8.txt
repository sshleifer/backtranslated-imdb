Generally, it is difficult to evaluate these cut and paste films. Some of the segments can be very good, while others reduce the overall product rating. In this, for example, the girl-only scene in Doctor's office was quite exciting ... one of the best (limited) viewing history of this viewer. Then there's the Asian segment ... the lady is always entertaining. And the history that unites the whole was an interesting concept. The swap scene that closes the offer is not bad either. Technically, production figures are fairly high. Recommended.
