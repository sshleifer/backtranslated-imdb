I never had a hunch as I watched the movie that was for the box of idiots. I always thought this was a great hit movie from the late 90's. But after I saw on the internet that this was for TV, I was shocked because for a television movie, it's absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> What worried me most was the length. I felt that one in a battle scene should have been removed since it was completely unnecessary. Moreover, he began to drag himself to the end, as it seemed that the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances from everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a bit dejected. I also felt that Gogool, who seemed demented, became a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was enchanted by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. Still, it's a great movie for television. 8 out of 10.
