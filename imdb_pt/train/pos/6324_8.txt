These guys are anything but the usual suspects! They are a total bunch of friendly eccentrics that you want to see get away from it, but they are so unhappy that there is very little chance of that. No one is better than William H Macy in portraying the man with a big heart, but down in his luck. This is probably his best performance since Fargo. Sam Rockwell threw the meathead boxer to perfection, and the rest of the gang was uniformly good as well. Luis Guzman brought a great comic relief as Cosimo, and George Clooney stole all the scenes in The assault scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The direction was also marked by the Russo brothers. There was certainly a sense of the Coen brothers throughout the film and it will be interesting. See how they will develop their careers. They have a long way to go to coincide with Coen, but this is a great start and I look forward to your next celluloid tour. ....... "Mutha is a prostitute"!
