A great storyline with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is hilarious as "Coach" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" superbly. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" puts on a good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her first lead extremely well. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The edition is first rate.
