As winter approaches, our state broadcaster, ABC, has decided for some reason to have a partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday nights. It started with a 12-year version of the movie "Emma" last Sunday; More recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" are to come. <br /> <br /> The curious about this production of A & E Television Networks, with the script of all time. Andrew Davies, confidently, appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget versions, one starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless," a "modernized" version starring Alicia Silverstone, who transported the plot to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale leading, this production sank without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, much is lost when novels are reduced to fit the duration of the movie. The adaptations that a person tends to like and remember are those that have enough space to develop the story and the characters. An excellent example is "Brideshead Revisited," which had 13 50-minute episodes in 1982. You only have to compare the very common version of "Pride and Prejudice" in 2005 with the brilliant six-part mini-series from TV 1995. . It is not that a novel should be filmed page by page, and some novels (usually not very good ones) fit wonderfully into the movies ("The Atonement" is a recent example), but Jane Austen novels need some time and space to exercise its total charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is OK. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self-confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is a frank Mr. Knightly (he reminded me that Jane tended to recycle characters.) Knightly is a more articulate version of P & P's temperamental Mr Darcy. Samantha Morton was a pretty flabby Harriet, but Prunella Scales got the gossiping Miss Bates perfectly? Sybil Fawlty in speed. Bernard Hepton, as Emma's weak father, was also excellent. We saw the moist landscape, the mud and the poverty, as well as the luxurious interiors, in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic time for all. <br /> <br /> Although this is a condensed adaptation, it was strangely slow in places ?? Some of the conversations were quite buoyant, even allowing for the formalities of the times. I would have to look at the film again to be sure, but it may be due to insufficient use of reaction scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like things from the filmed period, this is a good example, and compares well with the version of Paltrow. Anyway, there is more to come!
