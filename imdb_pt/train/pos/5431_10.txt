I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch I can not help but have fun with it. Gunga Din is one of those classic films made in the Golden Years of Hollywood when the actors themselves had to lure the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and creating "monsters" to make a scene. The on-screen charisma and comraderie shown by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is suberb and very fun to watch. The tongue-and-cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beautifully and seamlessly. Some may consider it "corny", but I consider filmaking "classic" and acting at its best. One must remember in watching this film that Europe was involved in a war against Germany and the public went to the movies to escape the horrors of war and be entertained and taken to a place where people were larger than life and performed heroic deeds. good would always conquer evil. Gunga Din accomplishes this perfectly, letting the audience laugh and with the actors during their harrowing adventures. In short, it's a classic movie that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the audience either.
