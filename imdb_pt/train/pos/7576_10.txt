The third and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete of all. The "training" is completed in the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of snipe being carried out by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical commentary on Japan's proud refusal to embody Western technology. Where Hanzo's first movie was just a funny and bloody ride, with little connection to the plot, "Hanzo 3: Who Has the Gold" manages to connect everything, and brings it all home in the end. Definitely the perfect ending. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (it's Hanzo the Razor after all).
