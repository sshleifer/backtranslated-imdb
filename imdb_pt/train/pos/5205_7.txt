A group of American students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying from the beaten path (by the creepy Irish local guy, natch), they do just that, and end their innards courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals (the cannibal descendants). the notorious clan Sawney Bean, who according to the silly plot of the film, raised sticks from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle. <br /> <br /> If you think that porn star more cheap horror equals tons of nudity and terrible acting, then think again: Evil Breed is full of adult stars, but in fact, there is almost as much nudity as if could have expected given the "talent" involved, and the acting, though far from the Oscar, is not all that bad (with the exception of Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know can make wonderful 'French' but whose Irishman sucks). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in superb style with the brutal slaughter of a pair of loving campers: after some brief sex under the screen, the sexy silicone is dragged from the tent and ripped in half; the guy has his arms and legs cut and is roasted on the spit. It's a very bloody start, and it bodes well for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things begin to decline seriously: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch young men in their twenties begging to become cannibals, and are subject to a good time wasting in the form of terrible false sustenances, many problems with druid killers of the Irish weirdo Gary (Simon Peacock), and worst of all, some sub-Scream, postmodern talk about horror film conventions (how clever!) . <br /> <br /> So, as it seems the movie will never get any better, director Christian Viel decides to be serious: a guy picks up a knife in the head and there's a free sex scene in the shower with the lovely blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT a porn star, but I'm sure there's a career out there waiting if she wants it). After that, things get better quickly as cannibals kick out the best meat-eating equipment, and the film is transformed into a real bloodbath: Gary has a machete pounding in his ass (in time!) And is strangled with your intestines; Ginger Lynn kicked a mutant; Jenna Jameson is torn, gutted and has her silicone breast implant gnawed by a confused cannibal; a guy is beheaded by a string of cheese; and Taylor Hayes is seen bloody, bruised and naked with a dead fetus between her legs (apparently she was captured and used as a breeder). <br /> <br /> All this is so outrageously bloody that it makes sitting through the less interesting stuff worth it, and gets a final rating of 7/10 for Evil Breed. <br /> <br /> NB. A very problematic production and studio interference resulted in Christian Viel eventually abandoning the project. Re-filming was done and blood was heavily trimmed for a US release. The good news is that although the film does not flow as well as it could, and is cursed with a terrible ending, the UK DVD (the version I watched) seems to have been relatively intact with regard to splatters. (only 13s were cut from the film in total).
