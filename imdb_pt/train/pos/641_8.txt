This show has some cliches and some exaggerations, the moments of Dawson's Creek (a 16 year old boy talking about when life made sense?), But overall it sounds like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson at the end. I just hope that each episode does not become a life alteration like the first, that would be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with a passion for baseball. I believe that many of us could relate to his admiration and, sometimes, to the tunnel vision for the team he always wanted to participate in.
