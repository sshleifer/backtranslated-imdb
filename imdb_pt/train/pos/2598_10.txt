As if the film had no value in itself, this is a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to read it. In the summer of 1968, I saw the movie in New York; At graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Part of the pleasure in reading the novel was the memory of the scrupulously detailed film. And for better or worse - and I've read and taught the novel for over three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
