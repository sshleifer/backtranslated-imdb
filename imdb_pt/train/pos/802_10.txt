I know I knew it was a good ending, but honestly it was incredible. I love it when a movie ends in a terrible and somber nature, but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor. I was really amazed. The harrowing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his master of darkness. A good sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was amazed at all the ships of the Rebel Battle ships and all the Imperial War ships and Superstars. I loved the new race they brought on the screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (co-pilot of Lando) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in the movie: 1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally injured. When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then appears Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest scene in Star Wars). 3- When Leia kills Jabba strangling the lord of the Hutt crime. <br /> I personally enjoy the script and the battle of Endor featuring a ground and space combat as well as the best Star Wars duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the bikini are memorable. 9/10
