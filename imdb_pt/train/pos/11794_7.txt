This is the exciting, fascinating and tragic story. Very good, and mostly pretty accurate, considering it's a TV movie, rather than a documentary. They have created some fictional characters and combined several real people into one character, but otherwise, this is a good account of a tragic and somber story. <br /> <br /> The last moments of the movie, depicting mass suicide. / murder, are almost directly taken from an audio recording by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the Temple of the Peoples' existence. It is available in various places on the internet. This part of the film is almost local in that sense. <br /> <br /> To summarize, a documentary is not. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the history of the People's Temple.
