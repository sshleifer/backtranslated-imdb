This movie completely ran around the original Dolemite. He had everything that makes a great movie ... except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do this alone and you know it!) I admit that I killed my first videotape of this movie and plan to buy the DVD version again as fast as possible! This movie has so many captivating lines that it's unfortunate! I'm ashamed to say that I know the theme song back and forth! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch to death, and he should have won the award for Best Supporting Actor in Blaxploitation, but the Oscar was never ready for it! This is a random movie that consists of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing and of course martial arts. (Being that it's the 70's and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial art). I think this movie must be restored and shown one night in the middle of a marathon in local theaters!
