Steve Carell stars as a person you can relate to (kind of) in Dan in real life, a movie that I hoped did not like but ended up liking. Not that the movie is funny out loud, it's just because it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, that's not what The Office fans would expect to see of him, but you know, I liked that movie. Carell stars as Dan Burns, a widowed father whose daughters do not really like him. One weekend, he and his daughters travel to see his family. While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls in love with a woman. When he returns to his home, he discovers that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes I found a little unbelievable. Is the Burns family really the kind of person who does exercises together and plays board games together and does a lot of other family stuff? I doubt that much. I do not know any family that is like this. Is that keeping me from having a little joke? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
