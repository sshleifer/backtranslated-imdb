It is difficult to overcome this film in many ways. Everything works very well here; the cast, the acting, the script and the cinematography are all first-rate. To the viewer, it is a moving and violent story of human love and redemption. For the film critic, there is a lot of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical errors, and as discussed in the tables, the ending lacks realism if it is strictly formal with the training angle of the CIA agent. However, I took the ending as being more moving because of the fact that instead of pursuing the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically recommends his soul to Ultimate without regard to the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it's actually a pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and limits evildoers one by one in their methodical quest for justice, which in fact results in redemption both for themselves and for the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is worth much if you are attracted by the genre. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) movie.
