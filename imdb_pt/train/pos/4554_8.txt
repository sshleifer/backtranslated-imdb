There are not many overcoming odds stories like Christy Brown's. Born with cerebral palsy in the 1930s in Dublin, his parents thought his disability was mental and physical. Although eventually properly diagnosed, Brown, in a working-class family with nearly 20 children, had to strive to be appreciated by his family. Through the use of his only fully functional member, the left leg, he learned alone to write and paint, both skills that he deftly developed. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" a great recount is his humility. Both director / writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis managed to tell this story in a way that does not scream for attention and uses melodrama. Cheesy fights and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of meticulous victory are easy traps for such a miraculous story, but "My Left Foot" remains truly and intrinsically inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing with someone with such severe physical disabilities has to be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a very complete picture of Christy, but he also manages to narrate the character's growth, improvement, and internal shift in different phases of his life. He plays Christy when he was seventeen when he had limited language ability and was emotionally volatile, just as the intellectually learned Christy struggles to deal with why he can not find non-platonic love. The latter theme is the strongest in the film and it would have been good for Sheridan and co-director Shane Connaughton to realize that. Regardless, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all these elements, giving a performance so believable that you often do not have time to think "man, he's a great actor." These are the most laudable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work in the film. This story is about the day to day life and the struggles. Although Christy has a unique set of circumstances that hinder her life, her struggles are no different from ours and Sheridan fully understands this concept. Christy struggles with love, parenting, issues of self-esteem and ability. Their struggles are only more physically manifest (literally and figuratively) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the great Brown family and Christy's unique place. The drama evolves naturally when the tensions are higher and the mood comes in the same way. The dinner scene, when Christy learns that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - is going to marry his brother Peter is the best example of the film from both Day-Lewis and Sheridan's efforts. It's so well built by Sheridan that he leaves when we're ready and Day-Lewis takes us from there with his awesome work. <br /> <br /> The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Mrs.. Brown. I did not know she'd won the Oscar, but there was something in her performances as Christy's wise and loving mother who just screamed Oscar-worthy. His love for Christy and constant struggle for him only seems so convincing and sincere and she gains a lot of sympathy given her situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal. Maybe this was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that looks organically human. The two must be reconcilable, but I imagine it challenging to tell a story that is realistic and provides dramatic enough moments to get our emotions on a roller coaster. The choice to underestimate the latter was definitely wise for "My Left Foot." Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they do not need to be squeezed for a heavier dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site moviemusereviews.com to know more
