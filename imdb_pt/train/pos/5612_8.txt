In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom, where the former tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The hostile concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tough Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) set strict rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels dominated by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone at the hospital and befriends his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes her landlord and neighbors are scheming to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and scary tale of paranoia and delusion. The story and process of insanity and loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the horrible location of his apartment, and what is really happening is totally unpredictable. The performances are incredible and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Tenant" ("The Tenant")
