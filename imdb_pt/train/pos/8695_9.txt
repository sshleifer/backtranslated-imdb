A long time ago, I watched this middle movie on cable. I then had a crush on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Eating Raoul. I was convinced that she is the sexiest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I might have a bit of prejudice about this movie. 9 of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I have on the original tape.
