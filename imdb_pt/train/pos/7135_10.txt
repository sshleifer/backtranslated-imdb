This has to be one of the most beautiful, moving and thought-provoking movies out there. It's good family entertainment and at the same time it makes you think a lot about the issues involved. Every time I see the ghost of Zac riding the bike in the end, I can not help crying. John Thaw's performance is so touching and it's a shame he's not with us anymore. Full marks.
