This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie on Dutch television in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month they were showing a Yugoslavian movie Every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (involving a train instead of a bus) whose name I can not remember. If you know, please let me know! In any case, how can I see this movie again ???? A DVD of that movie, where ?? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> The following week there was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) whose name I do not remember.
