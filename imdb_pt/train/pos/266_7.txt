This story has never been among my favorites in Christie's work, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motive was effective if a bit exaggerated, the bones of the story are there, although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all very well as I imagined them, although it was a shame they were not a more cosmopolitan bunch - maybe the 1930s setup would not allow that! I thought some very bold risks were taken with the filming; perhaps because I did not reread the book for a long time, but it seemed quite obvious to me who the killer was by his appearance in some revelation scenes at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more prevalent in these cases. Poirots early. Sometimes it works, but I found it very heavy in this episode (although I smiled in the disposable line 'Lemon sole'). All in all, though, a solid entry into the series, though not one of the best.
