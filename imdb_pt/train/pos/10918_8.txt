The Five Deadly Poisons is easily the most memorable K.F. Shaw Brothers' stable (except maybe Master Killer). There are the artists who came to be known simply as "The Venoms", some of the best fighting choreographies of all time and, surprisingly for a Kung Fu movie, a great plot! One of my all time favorites !!!
