From time to time, a movie that raises the level of all other films of the genre comes up. A film of this caliber will influence many movies after its release in the next few years. `A Chinese Ghost Story 'falls into this category. It is undoubtedly one of the best horror films made during the 80's; possibly one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have created a movie that appeals to all horror fans. The story is captivating and original. Villains are appropriately threatening and scary. The sets are scary and atmospheric. There is even a little blood and blood to satisfy the fan of the house. But do not let the 'horror' label scare you if you're not a fan of the genre. This film fits easily into many different categories. <br /> <br /> The screenplay expertly blended the genres of drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance into a delicious and delicious movie pizza. "A Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful epic love story told, fortunately, without the free nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that ruined Hollywood's "love stories." Those left aside by the romantic elements of history can sit and revel in sword-fencing and wire-fu. If that is not enough, actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide humorous enough to satisfy their appetite for comedy. This movie offers something for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark set up a really incredible cast for this movie. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I can not think of a performer other than Cheung who could have portrayed Ling Choi Sin better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is charming as Lit Su Seen, the enslaved spirit that steals the heart of Cheung's character. His interpretation of the title character is truly astonishing and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the crabby Taoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, this film is very impressive, even by today's standards. The direction is superb. I would like today's Hollywood executives to look for talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching instead of using the usual MTV video or Pepsi's commercial directors. Cinematography is beautiful. You have to compliment any director of photography who can make a movie look good when most of your crucial scenes happen in the dead of night. The composition of the special effects is high level. In fact, most of the creature effects in this movie do away with CGI's grumpy monsters and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror movies. Since its release, "A Chinese Ghost Story" has generated two worthy sequels, a full-length animated film and countless imitations. None of the films that followed or copied it captured the magic of this classic, however. This movie is a must-see for any horror fan or just for those looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of their time. 10 out 10. <br /> <br />
