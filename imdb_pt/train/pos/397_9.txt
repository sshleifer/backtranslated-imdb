I have to admit that Tsui Hark is unique, you can not outdo a person with a strong style of presence in the movies. A Chinese fantasy image may not be easy to present to an audience, the director tried to bring back the classic fantasy tales from Mountain Zu and that's what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu really improved from 1983. From this new millennium update, we could see Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu Mountains. Spectacular visuals, amazing epic action and fantasy, done wonderfully well. It kept me glued across the entire image. Great cast with only good acting. It's really a fun movie to watch, but is it really weird? <br /> <br /> Now, the downside is that people definitely blend in with their wide story, shortened in a 95 minute movie. The plot may not have much relationship between the characters, but when watching the movie again, you will have a better understanding of the characters themselves. Some may claim that there is not much physical combat, in addition to characters who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, spirits fighting from hand to hand make no sense at all. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this beautiful, stylish photo. It may have a small story, but look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", we were confused by the plot too, but it was really something stylish and wonderful. Tsui Hark always attracts something different to H.K. Movie theater. The American public may have some difficulty understanding when watching this movie, because this is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but its special effects are actually better than the Storm Riders. This really is worth checking out.
