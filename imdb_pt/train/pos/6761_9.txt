Dana Andrews's film cycle Noirs, by Otto Preminger, is among the (largely) unheralded gems of the genre. Not having paranoia, misogyny, or hysteria, may have seemed out of place at the time, but the clear-eyed images, the complex game with identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological principles, the austere and geometric style. today and very similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so loaded, brutal and ironic that the "happy" ending is one of the cruellest of Hollywood's history. Brilliant on the level of suspense fun too, tense and full of double-edged dialogues.
