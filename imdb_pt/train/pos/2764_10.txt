On the eighth day, God created Georges. But the same as an eighth day does not fit the week, Georges does not fit into the modern world: he has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, transferred to an asylum after his mother's death four years ago. She was the only one who loved him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man who is no longer loved. His wife left him, for reasons she is unable to explain. He loses the love of his daughters too, when he comes too late to the train station to pick up the two children, who wanted to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a highly skilled entrepreneur. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he entered a state of crisis, which reaches a climax after the loss of love of his daughters. He questions the meaning of his life, without getting any definitive results. <br /> <br /> Harry and Georges meet. At first Harry tries to get rid of Georges, the same as everyone else does. But Georges can not be shaken. And gradually, Harry realizes how much he needs Georges, if he wants to overcome his identity crisis. It is Georges who opens up a new access to the world for him and that makes him see his life with different eyes. Friendship and human warmth take the place of effort to calculate for success. No wonder Harry can not now avoid the failure of his work. <br /> <br /> Georges helps Harry regain his daughters' recognition. Even his wife has to admit that the fireworks that he organized were worth seeing. However, a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. And the new ends up being nothing more than a dream with a time limit, which will inevitably come to an end. The camera looks at Harry and Georges from above for a long minute, as they are both lying on the grass, just savoring the moment. But the same as this minute will inevitably pass, the friendship of the two men, who came out in such a wonderful way, will not be enduring. Georges is destroyed by the inability to love the opposite sex and can see no other way than commit suicide. Harry turns into a city bum, who asks drivers who are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity. <br /> <br /> The film describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism that devours positive values ​​such as human warmth or friendship. It is Georges, the Mongolian, who seems to be able to show the way of the dilemma, but unfortunately his request comes to a bad end. However, its failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or undesirable to achieve the desired goal. The way he shows us is certainly acceptable, though it requires a great deal of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical nonconformity.
