As in the movie, we follow the implausible, if always engaging, adventures of the two main characters. But while C + J avoid sex for a female journey back to infancy, this pair delights in their carnality to the point of exploiting homoeroticism. Most of the sex they get from reluctant or unwilling partners, and yet, despite their deeply unsatisfying behavior, they all emerge smiling. Like C + G, despite everything they remain innocent in the heart, rebels against the quotidien, the bourgeois, the restrictive. As someone commented, I would not want to know these two and it is a small miracle that their journey brings scenes of comedy and tragedy very small (and what is there can not be placed on your doorstep) and therefore for that. reason, made me cheated, but with a sweet taste in my mouth. I dare say that only the French can get away with movies like that. And that's part of your genius.
