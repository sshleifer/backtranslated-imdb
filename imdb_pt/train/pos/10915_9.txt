The RKO studios decided to lend MGM's William Powell and Columbia's Jean Arthur for one of their biggest budget efforts to profit from The Thin Man's popularity. They have succeeded to some extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to and before Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played in a few Philo Vance films in the title role. By then, it was well defined on paper. Dr. Bradford is not making as many liquid snacks as Nick Charles, but Nick's basic blas√© is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Dr. Bradford works as a physician. This helps in his vocation as a detective and, in fact, does in this film. He has two murders to solve. A jockey falls from a horse that enters the final stretch of a great race and dies for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something in progress, but he is discarded by the more conventional method of a bullet. That's after he comes to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was a firmer influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur is dumber than Loy. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> The ever-reliable James Gleason is the police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore, while Powell's butler was writing that part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed in this studio, we could have seen a huge amount of Bradford movies.
