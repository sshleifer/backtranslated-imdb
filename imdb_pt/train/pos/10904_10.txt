The most thrilling and truly eye-opening documentary ever created. I cried all the way, from beginning to end. Watching the show, you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we ​​take for granted. The first time I heard the title, I was almost afraid to see the program, it was difficult for me to understand living in agony every day of every year of my life. I really did feel for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny picks up his coffin. Could you imagine doing that? Even more, despite being in unbearable and unbearable pain, he still opened his own charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people who deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a model, what a true and undeniable hero he was!
