Strange enough, all the previous comments just described the beginning and left the details on top. I feel the need to confirm that this is a family job, since Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and the excellent jazz music was written by the director's father, Andr√©. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the song. The suspense was flawless and kept to the end. Robert Hossein, at the time one of the best European players, also managed to impose itself like director of cinema and director. He is still setting up big shows, with a preference for religious themes.harry carasso, Paris, France
