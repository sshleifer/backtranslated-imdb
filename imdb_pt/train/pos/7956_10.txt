This is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from animals are really what they are thoughts. I do not know if my video copy has a missing scene, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the hole. It also shows an animal survival instinct and tracking skills. Put the humans in the same position and the helicopters will be out. For once, an original movie is improved by a remake, since the first voice was removed. Only the use of animals can work in such a film because the use of people would have to spice up the story into murder, proving that, after all, animals are more interesting than people.
