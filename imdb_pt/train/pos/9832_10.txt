Wow, this was a great Italian film of "ZOMBIE" by Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF LIFE DEAD") Lucio started this movie and was sick, so the great Bruno took over and ended up surprisingly better than I hoped it was if you had seen "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucius Fulci and liked either or one of the themes then this is a movie you should Watch: "ZOMBIE" has a funny flying head "ZOMBIE" and "ZOMBIE" birds that spit acid on you and turn you into a "ZOMBIE" (This only happened to two people) but they are mostly just the big toxic "zombies" like in Bruno Matties "Hell of the Dead". So if you like Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or just "ZOMBIE" the movie in general than check this is a great Italian movie "ZOMBIE"!
