I've loved "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and I'm still loving it now, 5 years later. Yet many people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really received much love by the time it left. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is overdone and exaggerated but the same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All the scenery, costumes and characters are perfectly done in a fun way, without ever becoming ridiculous. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's an exaggerated movie at its best! Director Ron Howard really amazes with this fun Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason the film works and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He really carries the movie with his good and fun role. Of course he is helped by compelling makeup, which also received an Oscar. Of course, if you're a hater of Jim Carrey, you should not even think about watching this movie. This movie is really your movie and it makes it all work and very fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The film has a good moral, but it's all a little sweet for me. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and we really do not celebrate Christmas as enthusiastic and great here as in the United States or England. For me, the film was just fun and fun, and the morale made me a bit cool to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner's soundtrack is good and fun, even if it's your average every day. still works perfectly for the film and helps to be part of the scene's work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
