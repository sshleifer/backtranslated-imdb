Another for the Babes & Bullets crowd. The story is much bolder than any other musical I've ever seen: cannons hide the females' lost legs and place each one generative in the other in a way that approximates an intelligent commentary of what we might expect from the locality. More effective than the contemporary 'drama'. It is difficult to identify with a woman who holds a cannon in her pants - because of her luggage. Quite remarkable if you consider the context. <br /> <br /> Although the cannon does the leg thing provide 90% of the surprises, this movie also tells how greed supplants all other considerations in the life of a group of yakuzas chasing a woman who keeps her leg hidden like a cannon / rocket launcher (hence there are no bath scenes in group or strips) The hidden projectile launcher that is taken from the back of the protagonists, seemingly out of nowhere, in Dead or Alive (1999) The torch brought from the air by the heroine until the end of the original Tomie (2000), or the harrowing scene of the sniper in Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all testify a cantinflasquirreiro almost of the third world. influence in contemporary Japanese cinema, which I can not explain, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see good-quality films of this essence made in Hollywood, it's extinct and with cheap crap they consume for a cheap thrill, it's anything but laughable. This is a true movie and although it is great in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not unpleasant, steal of certain photos of Sergio Leon, involving cannons where the legs should be, and it is certainly appropriate!
