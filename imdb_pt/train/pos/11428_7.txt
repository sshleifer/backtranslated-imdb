As I reflect on this movie, I can think of two others to help put this into perspective. A relatively forgettable, but covering the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and much greater in scope is the unforgettable Indochina. Claire Denis produced a film that has some of the great foundations of Indochine, the complex and implicit relationship between France and her colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by Potee's dignity with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and his white bosses. I was also struck by the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the last one that gives the film its driving force, it is the last that connects this film to Indochina. <br /> <br /> You never know what motivates everyone, although some of the characters are needed for a movie remembrance. colonialism. It's this cynical side of the story that connects you to the Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the most scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis gives us a reminder of how it went with all the tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American Negro that gives the grownup A tour of France at the beginning and end of the film offers another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came, he wanted to call everyone a brother. He was coming home, but they just thought he was a little stupid. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but they do not completely understand what it is, although they can remember how it was. <br /> <br />
