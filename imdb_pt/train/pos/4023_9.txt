This is an extremely well done film. The performance, the script and the camera work are all top-notch. The music is good too, although it's earlier in the movie, when things are still relatively merry. There are not really superstars in the cast, although several faces are familiar. The whole cast does a great job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it is difficult to watch because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for putting Hindus and Muslims against each other and then severing them cruelly in two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it is also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat one another as they did at the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between religions and were smart enough to exploit them for their own ends. <br /> <br /> The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But it is never painted like a black and white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope of change in the younger generation. There is a kind of redemption, in the end, when Puro has to make a difficult choice between a man who ruined her life, but he also really loved her, and her family who disowned her, later came to look for her. But by now she has no option without great pain for her. <br /> <br /> This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave defects, and also that both can be worthy and considerate people. . The reality of partition makes this perception even more painful, since there can never be real reconciliation between the India / Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even if the resolution was heart-breaking. If the UK and the US could deal with their own stories of racism with that kind of candor, they would certainly be better off.
