Do you know how Star Trek fans got together in every Star Trek movie, even the really bad ones? Because? To see his heroes in action again. That's how I feel about Doc Savage. I'm a big fan of the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew on an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film only increased that sense of anticipation. So they decided to join elements of Doc's various adventures and cast them in this movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed movie. There are many promises here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (music, "camp" elements, etc.). But Doc's spirit is there, and that's what those of us familiar with Doc and his team respond to. So in my prolix way, what I'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's not as good as it should be. And anyone who fancies Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should check out this movie just to get acquainted with the hero who inspired them all.
