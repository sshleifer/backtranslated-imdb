This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well. <br /> <br /> Follow the adventures of a young man who decides to become famous in Las Vegas. illusionist, and it is partly about following your dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the toils of showbiz. I found the film charming, and have a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worth it. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is fantastic as the mage who never was, and his Max mentor makes a funny and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not for all probably, but if you like movies on the journey, then I think you will like this.
