This is a great Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great piece of action movie from Hong Kong. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macao looking for love and getting involved with a vicious pimp. The performances are great and the characters are all nice and well defined. The story is engaging and has plenty of romance, drama, comedy and suspense to keep one watching between the fight scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best fighting choreographer in the business. The action is simply amazing, esp. the fight with Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. A must see for any action fan.
