While others have commented that this video is only an edited version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you watch the original shows, you'll see that the dialogue in this video edition has been edited. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. I would say that if you want to see the program in its original version, check out the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on DVD now. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes of Galactica 1980 than the transmissions themselves. Overall, I rate this as a 10 because it gives more to take advantage of than the networks wanted to show in the time span they gave the producers.
