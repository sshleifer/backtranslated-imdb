I admit, I thought this movie would not be good, but I soon changed my mind. The movie was to keep him guessing how direction he's heading. Pierce Broson is incredible in his role as a killer, who suddenly goes off and asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is an incredible straight man, like his role as a gentleman from Denver, who initiates an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh, since Pierce delivers hilarious (mostly about sex). <br /> <br /> The imagery of this film is very well done, especially in the bullfighting scene and when Pierce sees himself when he tries to finish his last works.
