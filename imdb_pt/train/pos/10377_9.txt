A movie that I expected very little, and just watched to spend a quiet time - but what an hour turned out to be. Roll is an excellent, if not serious, country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-does-well story, it's funny everywhere, the characters are catchy and the pace is ideal. Toby Malone is the true star of the film with his captivating portrayal of Matt, said country boy and local football hero Aussie Rules come to the big city to try one of the great teams. He is superbly supported by John Batchelor as the local gangster Tiny. Beware of these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
