My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around Christmas 1976. I loved it and I love it now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this movie, but I think she looks great! ... And I seem to remember a number of women copying that permanent look at the moment! Also, the bath scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! The music is great too. This is the groovy 70's Babs at its best!
