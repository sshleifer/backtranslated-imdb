"Scoop" is easily the funniest Woody Allen movie of the 2000s so far. Allen, despite finally being his age, is at the top of his game as a low brow wizard, Sidney Waterman. Your one-liners and behavior are hilarious. Do not let critics influence your opinion. "Scoop" is a top "Woody-Lite" image. <br /> <br /> The classic soundtrack is an excellent complement to the onscreen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in that swimsuit. Jackman is running. Cinematography shines. "Scoop" is a great escape experience from start to finish. The last picture in the movie is only worth the admission price.
