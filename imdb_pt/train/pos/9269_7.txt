I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know about four times as much (I doubt I've learned much with Not Without My Daughter (1991)). Offside is a splendid Iranian comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to take part in a decisive soccer match for their country's World Cup berth. Women are not allowed to participate in football matches, so the country's military has been mobilized to save any woman trying to enter on their own. Some girls (teens?) Try to break the party by dressing like boys, but they get caught. The film is mostly set on this holding pen where the girls are held by soldiers, awaiting some unspecified punishment (though, the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was a badge far from being executed!) <br /> <br/> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The thought that holds women back from football matches boils down to being a very obscene experience for fairer sex - a philosophy not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to the fore when a girl needs to go to the bathroom, so a soldier escorting her requires her to cover her eyes so as not to see the graphite. The conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes: at one point, there is a friction between a soldier who is rural and the girls who are urban. Fortunately, this movie was not culturally esoteric comedy was lost on this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be in the mood for this, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they will not.
