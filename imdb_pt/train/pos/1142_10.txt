until HBO started to run again this month. I remember laughing out loud at the theater in 1991, and now again in my living room. If I see you're on, I have to watch. There's no doubt. This is a lot more fun for me than other more popular spoofs like the Airplane! (which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "sudden talk! The last symptoms of brain fever! It can explode anytime!" put me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg is not so funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field and Robert Downey Jr. all perform in superb performances as expected. I started giving 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the kind of movie it should be, there's nothing I change or improve. So it's 10. I have to get this on DVD, that's all there is to it.
