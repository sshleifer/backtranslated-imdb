I know I should like this movie, and I do mostly, but as others have mentioned, it's a bit long in the tooth. I also found the furious hormones of the entire male crew a little annoying. It's a wonder they did not start panting and howling at the moons too. I also have to say that overall the movie leaves me cold. It's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the plus side, the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster) as well as effects, props, costumes and, of course, Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would have been as popular as it was. The second half of the movie gains strength as we begin to investigate the "Krell" forgotten gadgets. As often as I've seen this movie, Krell still leaves me scratching my head to know exactly who or what they were. Based on what was being produced at the time, in addition to "This Island Earth", Forbidden Planet is miles above the average science fiction films of the time. Being shot in color also enhances your enjoyment. Certainly a classic by itself, flaws and all, and deservedly.
