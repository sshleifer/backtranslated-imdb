I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been very young, about 15 years. Been at Star Movies one afternoon. The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell that the thieves were joining for a score. He really picked up the pace after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's the set, they just play so well together. I can watch this movie at any time. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very strange trail. Jokes are not cheesy, but they are subtle and extreme, while making them hilarious. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
