It's been a few years since I've seen this, but remember and I'd like to see you again. It kind of became a "therapy" for me with a personal experience of my own. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five-year-old man mourns over a school baseball game in which he "lost the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if I had hit the ball" and how his life would be better because of it. So he gets a chance to find out ... and stays a little longer than he expected. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a lot of when I was in high school, I tried twice for our drill / dance team and I could not. This team was the closest thing to a fellowship in my school. If you were in that, you were "all that." I have not tried until my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it very hard. I hit and injured my leg badly before testing and I used pants to cover the bruise, and that made me not able to. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, even now sometimes, I think, "If I had not hit my leg, I would never have worn those stupid socks." Now I do not sit down and I think my life would be better or even different if I had done it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how things can be different by changing a little thing in the past. Who knows, it might have changed the course of events to the point that I had not met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that moment in the past that they wish. they could change. Be careful what you wish for!!!
