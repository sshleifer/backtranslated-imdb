Home Room deals with a Columbine-style shooting, but instead of discussing the actual occurrence, the film portrays the consequences and what happened to survivors, their trauma, guilt, and denial. The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action scenes beyond the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT command after firing on the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no culprit is convicted and two teenage girls surviving the incident, played by the very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing in common other than the filming are combined because of this and the drama that follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, though only 24 are on the block, so much so that viewers are quite familiar with her solid and reliable acting style. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and totally unknown to me, surprised me with his overwhelming dramatic force and onscreen presence. This girl was the part. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and connects to you with your intimate focus on the fragile and growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. The elephant of Gus van Sant (2003), though good, seems almost superficial and insignificant compared to the Home Room when it comes to a dramatic style and performance. What I can see is that this movie has very little screen time and exposure - much more a loss to an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
