Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed him wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the control of her husband. "Let him think about what he did," Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said firmly. The story showed a rural family dealing with the accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Kid," meaning that he was so disturbed and overwhelmed by what he did, he was emotionally paralyzed. So in the end, when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, left everything to a stranger, I was so heartbroken by him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things I've done in my life. I customized and identified myself with your character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs did not add much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonist and brother Ruth, Andy, as an idiot who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy lady punching Arnold out of frustration with his own problems, without mercy, and blaming him for his problems. I could not really feel sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep the marriage, she was unsuccessful. They both did not handle their problems effectively. They really did not do anything for the movie and were totally ridiculous. The least role of Wilfred Brimley as the grandfather was, for he was the only character who showed attention to Arnold. I felt that his role should have been worked out. The players were only doing what they thought was adequate and sufficient. However, I really enjoyed the ending, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
