The best part of Arguebly Al Pacino. He plays Tony Montana, a small Cuban team has become a rich and powerful lord of crime in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he has in this world, his balls and his word, and he does not break 'em to nobody. He begins to do works for a great Cuban businessman, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly climbs the ladder of the organization, along with longtime friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he tries to assassinate Tony, but without luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a large supporting cast between them is F. Murray Abraham as a nervous gangster, another known face is Harris Yulin as a corrupt cop trying to shake Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits for the screenplay Ecxellent by Oliver Stone. This movie is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his ups and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The film has a magnificent appearance. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: the chic restaurant ("Say good night to the bad guy"). the other is the final shooting where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick his butt and kills about 20 murderers who have invaded his house. This is certainly one of the most impressive finals of a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies is a must. For the rest of you, it's highly recommended. 10/10
