I bought Dark Angel Seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago after watching a few episodes of the first season on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I have not enjoyed anything so much since Firefly (also and amazing show). I admit that the second season was not so good, but there are still some incredible episodes (see Designate, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I heard some of the plans for season three, and I have to say, I can not believe she was canceled - I will not ruin it for you - but she would have rocked! I also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsession, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had, I've been through 3 episodes of having seen the two seasons twice. Is too good.
