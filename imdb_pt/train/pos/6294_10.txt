This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic acting and visual jokes, a tribute to the early films of Buster Keaton. A lot of bullshit: Buster falling in a door, falling into a puddle, running around pants without pants. The invention of the silly scientist of a time helmet, reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of ​​what the future would be. Cheap prices like $ 1.95 for women's hats, or 17 cents a pound of beef seem absurdly high for Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for the Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when he is transposed by mistake into the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to get back! The "scientist" of the time wants to return to a calmer world, the 1890 that he studied and admired. They come back together, and now Buster / Mulligan is happy and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back in his crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone does not have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. This is enough. <br /> <br /> Another cute thing - long underutilized Maytag Man Jesse White is a Time Helmet repairman - foreshadowing his career in the washing machine.
