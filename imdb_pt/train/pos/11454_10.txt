Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while now, and possessing some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something completely satisfying, and a little more than I expected. Being an artist myself (I work in clay), finding inspiration in our environment to make good art is imperative, and it's something that Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. Following it over the course of a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skill and devotion to artists' connection to nature with a drastic and inspiring touch. The music set in the film is engaging and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or someone who needs an uplifting experience, SEE THIS MOVIE. I, at least, am happy to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Creating, dancing, struggling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
