He ran from 1959-1973. It's more than his longevity that says a lot for this series. It's also survived changes in fashion and taste of the '50s, psychedelics of the 60s and remained popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I remember repetitions of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements of stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had its defining iconic character in this series. His appeal has been through the generations. All family members could enjoy it. He balanced morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A series of cartoons was made as an unfolding of this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its meaning.
