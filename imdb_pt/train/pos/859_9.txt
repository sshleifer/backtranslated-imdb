It is so rare to find a movie that provides a plot that can not be spotted at every turn. Surprises throughout delight. <br /> <br /> Some things I could not understand is that here you have the protagonist who plays "the good girl, hardworking" and in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker. That was not enough to make me dislike it, but it gave me a break. <br /> <br /> The other thing I could not do was the old man being dragged by the police at the end of the day. the film. I never got who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear what it could be. <br /> <br /> The film was thrilling and fun and always left me guessing. very worth seeing.
