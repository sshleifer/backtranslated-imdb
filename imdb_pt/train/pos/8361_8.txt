I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started to watch, but I ended up enjoying it. I would not call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call this shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially, women would not like or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two anti-heroes treat all the women they encounter seems unutterable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem. I'm fascinated how Blier got away with it. The film is very entertaining and very enjoyable: it's well written, the performance of everyone is first class and the music is sweet and melancholy. In fact, when I think of it, two friends did something good for the women they came across: they prepared a woman on the train (the lovely, docile blond Brigitte Fossey who started her film career with one of the most impressive premieres in "Forbidden Games ", by René Clément (1952), at the age of six, to meet her husband whom she had not seen for two months, they found a man who finally got a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) and was pleased, they enlightened and educated the very young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her first onscreen appearances.) Her meeting with Jeanne Moreau elevated this comedy to the tragic level.Besides, I'm not sure if I would like to meet Pierrot of Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere of Gérard Depardieu in real life and invite them to dinner, but I had fun watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.
