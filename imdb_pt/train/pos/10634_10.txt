In order to prevent his homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem with this is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have their lives separated when one night after Albert's birthday party, they fall into bed and then in love. Later in the film after falling in love, Stella suspects that Albert has cheated and appears in his work one night after the closing. What she finds will leave the viewer stunned. This is a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it's amazing they were not recognized for their work here anymore. Very controversial with its release in 1978, the movie "R" is now "PG" in this much more liberal time. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a "Making Of" segment in the special features and it is said that the film was based on a real story, so the viewers who say the film is not " real "are mistaken. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons, these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved!
