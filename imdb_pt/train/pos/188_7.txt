I'm a big fan of classic movies, but I'm getting into silent movies. Many silent films do not catch my eye, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this photo. Davies in particular shows a wide variety as she turns from a small, giggling little girl to a star who takes herself a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast-paced film with a fantastic array of appearances. by some of the greatest stars of the silent era. The movie caught my eye immediately and I really forgot that it was a silent movie. (I know this does not make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are needed. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent movies. It is a fast and interesting film, with two of the best stars of the silent era. Add in Hollywood satire and Show People should be on the 'must see' list for all fans of classic movies.
