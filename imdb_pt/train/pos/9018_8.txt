Despite its unobtrusive launch in this country, and its apparent disrespect in other countries (the 'R' rating in the United States may not have helped - honestly, just because HBC uses the word C!), That's actually a fine piece of work . Sentimentality occasionally threatens to suffocate him, but is overcome by the play of the two tracks. <br /> <br /> It's easy to win applause just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter may not capture physical degrada- tion well of DNM, but his vocal stretching and relentless emotional impulse completely compensate. In fact, almost all of his performance is accomplished through his eyes (and what eyes!). This is a clever twist of an actress who is rapidly undoing her reputation in the English Rose, and emerging as a figure of a certain stature. Prizes should certainly follow, though not for, that good performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, sit down, never did your best in the movie (except possibly 'Hamlet', and there your game was diluted by the big cast). Here, however, he tops his other appearances, throwing to the end a self-hatred, unstable, ultimately adorable, with a subtlety that he has not always shown, and displaying intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, as much as we could not believe him as Frankenstein, as the priest in 'The Proposition', as the lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man', even as Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'. This is certainly your best performance yet - so why could not it produce the products much sooner? Like a movie, it looks more like a television offering, and without its stars it probably would not amount to much. But it has been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks like this, and I look forward to more of them (though not 'Love's Labor's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
