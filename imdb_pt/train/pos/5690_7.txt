I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought the acting was very good, but the overall story left a lot to be desired. This film has the same texture and appearance as Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. It is difficult to believe that human beings can live this type of life; in the underworld of society, where their total existence is based on the use of drugs, crimes, violence, sex, and total lack of self-respect for someone or something, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is notable in his role as Hollywood pornographic ex-superstar John Holmes. The support cast is so good. However, this is a dark, dark, disturbing and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily life of these people was also brutal. Unless you have an interest in these murders or were a "fan" of John Holmes, this really is not a movie to see. If you want to see a murder documentary, Truman Capote's 1960s Cold Blood movie starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
