For me, this is the most perfect film of Ealing Studio - so fresh and relevant half a century later, as was the day it was released. As a satire on the economic notions of 'growth' and the commercial need for built-in obsolescence, it could hardly be more up-to-date. And what other film can be said that the hero literally uses the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely, there are parallels with Jurassic Park, where tinkering with the environment will literally turn and bite you. But Spielberg shied away from the book's brilliant central concept to address some nonsense about "children." Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In The Man in the White Suit, Alec Guiness plays a young idealistic scientist who comes with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out. Suddenly, the workers and capital of the northern British factory, where he is working, are united like never before in protection of their subsistence. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing, it's a comedy, but it did not have to. The complex interplay of vested interests (which should be appropriate?) Unfolds wonderfully, for, one by one, all parties perceive that "progress" is a threat, and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms spinning. <br /> <br /> But, yes, this is a comedy - even pointy - and amid the political ironies there are delightful performances, and some good old-fashioned laughs. <br /> <br /> However, it is the scathing satire. which endures - dazzling and white.
