This movie is great. Simply. It's rare to find a comedy with levels, and this is a good example of that. When I first saw this movie, when the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... 'did you just understand?' For those who doubt, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, DNA! See the various characters, each pushing into position, and if you do not see anything else, see the connection between Vick's healing and the way through the movie. It's all in Vick's head! The opening line about Vick's world. The final scene with the camera going to Vick's head, and inside, a whole universe! Totally quoted, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
