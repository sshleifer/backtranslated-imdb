He-He-Hi! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your fun, independent New York girl from the early 1990's. Along with her partying friends, she meets a mature Turkish salesperson. It's a story about the age for new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It's comforting to see a lazy woman turn into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us who are relaxed and who may feel that their only skills can be kept as they are hammered, and a loaf to play happy holidays. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I've never been a huge fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies. There are subtle mannerisms that have perfected your character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, be sure to watch this movie. Repeated visions are a must.
