This is a great movie that everyone should see. It's like a book by Dean Koontz. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was great as he seems to believe what he's saying and doing. <br /> <br /> I do not know. why viewers have to read some sort of defense of religious murder in the film. It's fiction. The ending is surprising, but fictional. And? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE. Throughout the film, the viewer is continually shocked by Paxton's illness, the impact on children, and the way children deal with such outrageous behavior. And then, in the end, it turns out to be true. God set him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. Of course, he gets information he could not know otherwise, but the film goes further to show how God is "protecting" Adam through the convenient quality of video problem and the complete lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film is not defending Christian murder, it's just taking the viewer on an unexpected walk.
