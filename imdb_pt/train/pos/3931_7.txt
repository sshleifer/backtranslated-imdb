A somewhat fictional biographical portrait of director John Ford's early Abraham Lincoln years, focusing primarily on a judgment in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film offers an interesting description of this important American film. figure and the film is well done but seems a bit incomplete without any of the great moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me was that while I admired the picture, it was not as satisfying as I think it could have been with a larger scope. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have Henry Fonda, who effectively exhibits a silent force. Fonda's performance includes some ungainly mannerisms and other affections that are reasonably effective in presenting a portrait of Lincoln, particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costume that occasionally is somewhat self-evident. The support cast is solid and surprisingly does not include many of Ford's regular castings (sometimes called its stock company), but we have Ward Bond one of Hollywood's most prolific actors. Bond appeared in more AFI Top 100 films than any other actor, both in the original and in the magazine. He also appeared in 11 Nominees for Best Picture. The film features a scene that seems to have inspired a very similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird" where it would be made even better than here, although this scene is one of the most effective in this film.
