This movie was featured in one of the first episodes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about that wonderful TV series. I believe this was a surprising and good horror movie from the early 1940's, with surprisingly good sound and image for a 67-year horror film in the public domain. I really enjoyed seeing Bela Lugosi and her bizarre staff, including her wife, who requires fluid from the glands of young brides, an old woman and her two bizarre sons, one of them a giant idiot, the other a comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto from 1932's Freaks ). I also liked the young reporter, who is kind of stereotypical, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this decent movie is the plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I do not want to ruin anything in this movie, so go out and rent it, or better yet, buy a couple of dollars.
