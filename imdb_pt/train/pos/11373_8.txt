Here's a quirk: a modern movie about a serial killer that has no fight scenes, no one saw them die, no car chases and no loud noises ..... and it happens in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are horrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is a detective's job, and how much bureaucracy the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very somber, and "dark" film best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea) as well. However, the story is not depressing and is very interesting all the time. <br /> <br /> Rhea is excellent as the determined and tormented detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as the killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspect, but he plays the only character in this movie who has a little affection. Once again, the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to prejudice against gays, the full validity of secular psychology, police officers and government officials being coarse / gross / fanatic, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a clever and refreshingly understated crime movie. This is a somewhat original movie that is probably not well known, but it is much appreciated by the people who saw it. Since it's based on a real-life account of this killer, it's even more scary. Do not pass this just because you have nothing on it.
