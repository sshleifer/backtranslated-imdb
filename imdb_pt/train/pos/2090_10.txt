This is where the term "classic film" comes from. This is a wonderful story of a woman's extreme bravery, courage and loyalty. Poor Olan was sold to her indifferent husband, who over the years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah, A PEARL !!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who won the Oscar for Best Actress last year for her small role (and what a waste of an Oscar) in "The Great Zigfield" . It did not really show the talent, if any, that she had beyond her exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she did not have great costumes either. People say she did not show real emotions in this movie. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy, timid woman with inner strength. She stays quiet for parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being filmed. If you're saying she does not act well in this movie, you're NOT looking! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that he can also act. Your character is not nice to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the end of the story. A sweet and devoted wife and mother, with her own special beauty. The greatest of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie, watch. You will see one of the best movies that the golden age of Hollywood created.
