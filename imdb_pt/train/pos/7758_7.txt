An exaggerated melodrama typical of his time (mid-1950s) and proper morning food. Rock Hudson, the hulk that everyone always falls in love, plays his usual stereotypical role, but while in Giant, made in the same year, when his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average, in this film he is just not good enough to raise the gauge beyond a soft tale of how hard it is to be rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, staggering through the movie into drunkenness, and Dorothy Malone, playing a poor and totally exaggerated vampirinha) end up losing and Hudson gets Bacall - which is better wood in this part that has no character enough or wit to make it work. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the good happy ending and the bad unfortunately, this is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested in reading that the film is based on a true story that justified the plot. Like other films of the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Maybe the movie could be redone: Stack's character would sound truer if he were hiding homosexual feelings for Mitch at his wedding. Todd Haynes's Far From Heaven has improved a lot on All That Heaven Allows, also directed by Sirk. Maybe Haynes could redo the Written on the Wind book and give us a truly memorable movie.
