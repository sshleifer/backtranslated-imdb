This is a very, very old drawing of Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not as elongated as later and his voice is not quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor fellow who buys insects from an animal store - there is no weapon or desire on his part to blow the rabbit into pieces! However, despite this, this is still a very nice film. The first insects were definitely more daring and cruel than their later incarnations. In later movies, he messed with Elmer, Sam Yosimite and others because they started - they messed with the rabbit. But in this movie, he's much more like Daffy Duck from the late 30's and early 40's - an idiot who loves to annoy others !! A true "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. While this is not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much it has changed over the years.
