Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you have to love "My Left Foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance). He plays Christy Brown, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Because of this, he spent most of his life in ostracism. Even when they try to warn people about something, they just laugh at it. The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over a part of the body: the left foot. He uses this appendix to paint and write poetry, bringing it to prominence. Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well with this collaboration, and also in a later collaboration: "In the name of the Father" (but "The Boxer" was unnecessary). "My left foot" can make you feel in various ways: sad, hopeful or whatever. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here. A great movie in every way.
