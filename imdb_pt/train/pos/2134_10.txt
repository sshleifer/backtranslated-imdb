Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an excellent group of films that will live forever, as is the case of "The Shop Around the Corner". This film was remade in other less remarkable films and in a musical piece, without the charm or the elegance of the definitive version of the own Lubitsch. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart have worked on several films together. His characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost seeming to be acting. Both stars are delightful as the pen friends who do not know each other, but that fate had them working together in the same store in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic movies worked so well is the amazing support cast the studios together in photo after photo. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the store. In addition, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing an impressive job in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these films will live forever. !
