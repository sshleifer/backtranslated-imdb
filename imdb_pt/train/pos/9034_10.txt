This movie was absolutely brilliant !! Each performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if that is something to happen. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, as he is usually associated with big box office hits (Jumanji, Honey, I shrunk the kids). It pulls from every pure-class scene. My favorite scene was where Homer was coming down the mine and looking up into the sky, coming down, like all his dreams, was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant acting films, as well as his big budget blockbuster, which is also great. KUDOS !! for all involved in this masterpiece!
