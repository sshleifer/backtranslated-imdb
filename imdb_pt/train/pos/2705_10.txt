This is a script that Ed Wood has worked for over 10 years trying to get done. Aris Iliopulos finally had the audacity to film a screenplay that Wood saved from his burning house, at the expense of other more transitory valuables. <br /> <br /> This is a film without dialogues, which some may describe as silent. . In fact, it's a pretty noisy movie, without the petty chatter of most movies. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than any movie in the Hollywood scripts factory, particularly that stupid boat movie where Billy Zane was last ("Watch out!" ! '- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I'm going to take Zane's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film about any day of empty dialogue. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane leads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as ever, and the gods are shining when you can put the name of Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid set exquisite, and Ron Perlman's beastly performance is simply wonderful. Overall, this is a chaotic and visceral masterpiece, carefully crafted by fans of Ed Wood Jr., auteur and cinenephile. A must see for anyone who really loves movies in the way that first rate Iliopulos and his cast obviously do. A movie to make you wish you had done it yourself.
