I loved October Sky. The thing I loved the most was music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the movie, it gives the viewer a period of time. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score assumes. The song now fits perfectly into the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not just enjoy the song, I also really liked the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise to me. He gave a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about escaping from life already planned for you twice now, and both times I had so much fun.
