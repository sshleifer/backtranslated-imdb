All right, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I was reading how people changed that with Michael's version and that's a good trick in my opinion because some adults hate horrors and when they see it they get interested in horror movies like this or maybe (I've never seen ) the horror (possibly comedy) Uncle Sam, I'll have to see about renting or buying this movie, but the second one is way better than this, but I bought this on VHS from Amazon and got November 21, one day before Day of Thanksgiving. worth the four dollars, l.l. in this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
