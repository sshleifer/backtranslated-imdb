I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially beautiful film. The story is simple but effective, the characters lovely and well crafted, but what really shines is the design of the digital setting. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than in reality, the designs give you a really good one. looking at the world in an amazing use of color. Sometimes the touches of reality shine (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it is a fantasy world based on reality. Including loads of vast landscapes, especially helps minimize rendering costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this shines with effective uses of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Technical flutter, the movie is fun, familiar and sometimes hilariously funny.
