As a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is the school shooting, this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troublesome men (I can not refer to people who kill as boys or teenagers), the months of preparation leading to zero day (the codename of the day they will attack) the film tries to present the situation on the opposite side of the weapon. It seems intentional in portraying the pain they suffer, but focuses on literal preparation. The problem is that little in terms of emotion is delivered directly. The only point at which the emotion became overwhelming was the end, as expected. But leading to this point, it is never really clear why they are planning this. We are told of the mandatory story that they were ridiculed, but the film also seems to contradict this. Without ruining the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions, but falls short because of the production of sloppy films. The whole direction is amateur, to promote the concept of homemade video, but the history and the continuity are weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but it also does not provide the information for such an event. The ending is abrupt and it does not seem like it ends all that the movie started.
