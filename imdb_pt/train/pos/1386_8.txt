Three teenagers in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is almost there. At the apex is Marie, a serious young man, short and lean, with a facial structure similar to Belmondo. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquettish, chubby - dare to say fat - and desirous of her first kiss with a boy but not yet ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her cuteness, the boys do not seem interested and it hurts her. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the apex is a beautiful blonde vamp fille fatale. She is deeply involved in synchronized swimming at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie insinuates herself into the life of the vampire using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vamp has the reputation of being a prostitute, staying with any young male orbiting around her. Marie is not wiped out by that reputation. Put an emphasis on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first semester is set. We get to see a lot of synchronized swimming when we get to know the three girls. Eventually, the narrative leaves swimming synchronized behind and focuses on the confused relationships between the three. That's where unexpected things start to happen. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films to leave nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This is no exception. Here it is about the ceilings and the dying. Watch the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful. That the sport for women only is a metaphor for the life of a girl: beautiful and feminine on the surface while working hard and competitive underneath. A number of scenes direct this point: elegant movements and smiles for the audience, legs kicking awkwardly underwater. The title in French is also suggestive: "prieuve," or octopus, suggests that an individual has to deal with many pressures simultaneously.
