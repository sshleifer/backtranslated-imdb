A well-rounded summary of a real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I guess that's how it might have been. I think there are two typical American points of view evident in the film: "communistophobia" and parallel to Adolf Hitler. These should be apparent to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe does a great job, as do many other known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - it all happened, and it probably looked like that). But, in fact, did this last scene at the air station really happen?
