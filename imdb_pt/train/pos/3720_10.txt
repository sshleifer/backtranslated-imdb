Joel Schumacher Made a choice when he decided on this cast and script. The story is well written and well defined, and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed like there were 6 "leads" and about half a dozen support, and by far this is the best thing about the movie, the young faces of tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood played the controversial Vietnam War films, which say something about the "story that needed to be told" (as Schumacher says) and about the land of Tigerland in that wartime period. However, it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and others. I think anyone who wants to just watch a good movie with all the special effects but just a good drama, should go see the Tigerland, obviously the Shumachers Best works in the last 8 years.
