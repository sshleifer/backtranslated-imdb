I was not a fan of watching this movie, but when my girlfriend called me and said she had a free and advanced screening pass, I followed him just to see eva longoria and laugh at the jason biggs antics. <br /> <br /> Overall it was really better than I expected, but not much. This was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and like the sky. a typical romantic comedy with its moments I think. the film was pretty short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghost haunting her ex-husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the support cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs coming in at a gentle pace. <br /> <br /> Overall I liked the movie just because it had a fair amount of laughter to keep me going, otherwise I would have given this movie a lower rating. Hey, it's a girl movie and I'm reviewing this movie from a guy's perspective, it would be more of a fair fight if the women reviewed this movie and gave their thoughts on it.
