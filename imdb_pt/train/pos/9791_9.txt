I will not reveal anything describing the plot of this film, except to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a blind girl whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to find out why her friend has ended her life. As she pursues her research and the information accumulates, this leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is skillfully paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind, is excellent. Israeli cinema has definitely matured and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the US.
