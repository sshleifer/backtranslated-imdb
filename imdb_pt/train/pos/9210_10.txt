I feel like this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, I'm an older man and I love most westerns. I love part-based movies, at least in fact, if I'm not mistaken this is a movie like that. I also like revenge-type movies, that qualifies there too in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and barn shooting scene. I felt that the spanking scene was a little overdone, but it did not affect how I feel about the complete movie. I saw what I think is a continuation of this movie in an episode of gun smoke. I also liked that. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I'll watch it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this film were well played. I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis to play some kind of villain, but I always like his acting.
