Although I agree it's a good movie, but not great, for many of the reasons other posters mentioned, I still like it. One of the reasons is music: I would draw attention to the very cool appearance of the Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a scene well staged in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of the day, and managed to convince Jimmy Stewart's mind by playing a hysterical trumpet duet, a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. Candolis really played very well, although I suspect that the actual music for this scene was later dubbed by the two. I do not know much about George Duning, who gets credit for the song (plus he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges on more than one occasion), but the cast of the Candoli brothers as witches playing jazz was a really nice touch.
