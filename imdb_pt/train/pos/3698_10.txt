I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it at L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the comments in LA Weekly and decided to buy a ticket for this movie. the film stars Molly Parker (from my favorite television show, Deadwood) and Lukas haas - which I suspect we'll see more in the very near future. The film is funny, comforting, presents great performances and beautiful photographs. I do not know if the film has distribution, but I hope it does - that is - soon. this is meant to be a true indie gem. even the music of my favorite band is the silver Jews! the only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not there on display. even without her there ... this was by far the best movie I saw at the festival.
