The Williams family lives in a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in considerable danger when the place is suddenly pushed into a vortex in time, where the past, the present, and the future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable way. Director John "Buddy" Thistles begins the movie with a mysterious note and gradually lets things get stranger, crazier, and more exciting as the story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with many stunning visuals and does a good job of creating a genuine feeling of admiration and admiration. The admirably sincere performance of a cast of games qualifies as yet another great advantage: Jim Davis as the healthy patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the concerned Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as a sweet little girl Jenny and Scott C. Kolden as the brave Steve. Funky special effects offer an inspired combination of twisted miniatures, stop motion animated monsters (such creatures include a small hairless face, a large, lumpy animal with fangs, and a skeletal lizard face), plus beautiful matte paintings . Richard Band's thrilling full orchestral score really hits the tossing point. The crisp, sunny cinematography of John Arthur Morrill also does the trick. A fun movie.
