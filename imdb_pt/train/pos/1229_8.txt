I waited ages before seeing this as all the reviews I read of this said it was awful! I rented expecting the worst, and while it's not Sandler's best movie out there, there's a lot worse! Sandler often talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously, but that's all part of the fun! A great way to miss an afternoon, and you might even find yourself laughing once a couple of times! A good movie, worth renting!
