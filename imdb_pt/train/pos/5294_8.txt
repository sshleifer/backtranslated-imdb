"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his cheeky ways in his old age. Many things have changed since Waters started making movies in the 60s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, Waters' film budget has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was surprised to see that Waters still has that "trailer" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a boy obsessed with photography. He lives a fairly long life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always available Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worse. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It's not among his best films, but there are some big lolies here ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). He's consistently clever and funny, and has that very "weird" feeling that I've come to love in Warters movies.
