<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, recorded in my memory to never leave me is a scene in which Mickey Rooney, - "Killer Mears" knows that he must run and is coming close to the moment of truth, he dances and cries and laughs, he hesitates of hesteria the euphoria and run the gambit of emotion always. I have never seen such a brilliant performance by any living or dead actor, past or present. It was then that I know for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is a great genius actor. However, I have maintained this, my opinion for myself for years thinking, surely I should be alone in this point of view. About 15 years after I last saw this movie on television, I happen to have read the old Q & A section of the Los Angeles Times. The question was asked to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was, "Mr. Olivier. Are you considered one of the greatest actors of all time, whom you consider, then, as one of the greatest actors?" His response was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned, but not surprised. I immediately returned to his "Killer Mears" and felt very good to have seen this great skill in him, and now have my vision supported by another work that I admired .. Later, of course, there was "Bill" and many others great moments with Mikey Rooney. This movie, "The Last Mile", should be seen by all students who perform. I honestly do not remember much of the movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave me. If someone out there remembers this movie the same way I do? I would be interested to hear from you. For this picture engraved in my heart, I gave a 10 only in the face of his performance.
