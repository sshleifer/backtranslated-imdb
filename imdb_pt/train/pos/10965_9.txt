Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. Even if her home was filthy, this is somewhat understandable considering her mental illness. On the message board, a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the skills to deal with an eight-year-old child." It reminded me of when in the 2009 dramatized version, Big Edie tells Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's only up to yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. Maybe if little Edie was not so hard on herself the first time things went wrong, losing her hair, her job, and the love of her life, she would have. This somehow ties in to what I believe to be your mental illness: your inability to stand up when times are tough and see what good times are to come. The world will never know what happened if she did not hear her mother's request, "Come on home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> However, these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, moving and lovable, even in their extremely filthy home. These women were extraordinary and the interaction between them brings humor and sadness. When Edie has had one of her emotional breakdowns, thinking about what might have been, or about how she wants to leave home because she feels like a little girl, the person has the intense desire to hug her and tell her that "everything It's going to be okay! " <br /> <br /> Great documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
