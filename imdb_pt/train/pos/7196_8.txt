As a series, Zorro's Fighting Legion is one of the best action series of the 1930s. Made in a time when studios could still have a great cast, this one has wall-to-wall action throughout its 12 chapters. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the President of the newly formed Republic of Mexico, Benito Juarez (Carleton Young is trying to put his new country in a solid financial position. the capital of the local San Mendolita mine. Members of the local council plan to steal remittances in the name of Don-del-Oro, a god of gold armor who, with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, waits Don Francisco (Don D'Oro), who forms a legion of villagers to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is murdered by men from Don-del-Oro, a stranger, the fopish Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in the city Diego aka Zorro assumes the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster) The symbolic heroine of the play is the sister of Ramon, Volita D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon have seats in the local council. that some of the other members of the Council are in alliance with Don-del-Oro. The first is the chairman of the Council (Leander of Cordova), the head of the militia Manuel (John Merton), the chief justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> What follows are several hair-raising escapes of Zorro and his confederates from the followers of Don-del-Oro. We have the ever-present collapsing rope bridge, the deep abyss between two cliffs on which only the Zorro can leap for safety, and the usual array of explosions, fires, wagons and wagons colliding or falling on the cliff. Hats off to Republic's excellent stunt staff, led by legendary Yakima Canutt and the Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his signature stunt jumping on a team of fleeing horses and then falling under the trainer he has repeated in other films including John Ford's "Stagecoach" that same year. <br /> <br /> In any case, Zorro finally unmasks the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace to the valley before setting off for the sunset in chapter 12. <br /> < > Others in the cast include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don-del-Oro. and if you look closely, you may find bits of the future serial star and the Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore and the stuntman Canutt, in pieces. "Big" Jim Pierce, by the way, may be best remembered for playing Tarzan in "Tarzan and the Golden Liom" of 1927 (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs, daughter of Tarzan's creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> /> Completely enjoyable.
