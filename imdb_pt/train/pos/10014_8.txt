The Night Listener caught my eye, with Robin Williams shining as a radio host in New York who is delighted by his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams never met the kid himself, they only got in touch talking on the phone. However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (good work of Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, which causes Williams to make a meeting with him personally. What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I'll leave it like this. Toni Collette also stars. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrait of Culkin's foster mother. Sandra Oh also starred as a friend of Williams. The Night Listener is inspired by real events, and has a dark, almost chilling silence. Sometimes it's predictable, not thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just because of the logic, but I liked it anyway. I like Williams in roles like this, more than his comic characters, so that was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
