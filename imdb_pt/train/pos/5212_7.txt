STAR OF THE CLASSIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A remarkably bad actor, passing by for his (now vanishing) appearance rather than a strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position on the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet on the leading roles of man who still maintains a remarkable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have adapted more to this type of direct role for DVD / limited release roles and as such may seem to be firmer in his fort now. <br /> <br /> He has to use a severe subject here. as the hardened and cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one of those workers assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in a US area, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must lead to his latest case investigating the kidnapping of a young woman as she tried to forgive herself for a case he failed in times past. <br /> <br /> This is a certain dive on the darker side of humanity, stepping on material definitely not for the picky or those looking for light visualization. And as such, it is a very strong and compelling film, unshakeable and not limited by its direct budget to the DVD. The only thing that really pulls her back is the overuse of fast, fast camera sequences used at the most dramatic moments that seem a bit cheesy after a while. But it's still one of the most solid materials I've seen in Gere, relentlessly getting darker and more along the edge as it continues. ***
