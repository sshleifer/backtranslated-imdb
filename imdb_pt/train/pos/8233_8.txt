Fido is a story about more educated zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. It all collapses though, when young Timmy's Fido zombie eats the family's neighbor. From then on, the disaster (well, maybe not the disaster, but to a certain extent, the chaos) occurs. Most people treat their zombies fairly, and one of these characters sleeps with their zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not too disturbing as well). And we find the loving Fido, whatever he does. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the less violent zombie movies (there is no negativity in this statement). I recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 8/10. Rated R for zombie-related violence
