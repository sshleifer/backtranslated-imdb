Good story. Good script Good cast. Good acting. Good direction. Good art direction. Good photography. Good sound. Good editing. Good everything. Put all this together and you will have good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame is that currently there are not enough movies of this caliber being made. We may consider ourselves fortunate that writers / directors such as John Hughes can occasionally make their creative voices heard. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I am watching a movie for the third or fourth time and still meeting completely satisfactory I have to conclude that something about this movie is right.
