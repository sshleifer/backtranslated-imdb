Although it certainly was not the best movie I have ever seen, it certainly cost $ 8 (which can not be said for many movies currently). <br /> <br /> This was a nice story from a movie. true story, although many of the details of the actual story have been distorted for the film (ie the Billy Sunday character was composed of three or four people in the actual story combined). Robert DeNiro was clear, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. was also impressive.
