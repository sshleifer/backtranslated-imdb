* Mark where the spoilers are! General Comments: If you can watch a serious movie, check it out. Have an open mind and you will have fun. Do not leave the theater because you get confused with what's happening! The film fits very well in the second half. I'm going to take my mother to see him again when the movie is officially opened. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this in a session a few weeks ago when Will was promoting the movie. He was great - he spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the photo Will! About Will's performance: Often, when you watch a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie / show, you always think of them in their current performance, much like what you think of them in past performance. This is not the case for Will Smith in this movie. I did not imagine Fresh Prince (lol) when I was watching this movie. He was completely and totally convincing in this very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think he's going to at least get an Oscar for that performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He is sad ... guilty ... very determined, but very scared. Very true to himself. Your character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, Will was able to bring that to life. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a good job portraying Emily, a woman far behind her taxes. Maybe she's not the bright star Will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character did not have as much work to do as Will. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie, and nothing made sense until the second part of it. But when things finally fit, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really gets you. <br /> <br /> In fact, it takes a lot of you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people wept until the end - even grown men. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* smaller SPOILERS ***** That's why it's really hard talk about the plot without giving great things away. I feel like knowing a lot about this movie really messes it up. There was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I liked, though. I will mention some of them here (without trying to give much). <br /> <br /> The fish Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first it makes no sense at all. There was a lot of talk in the movies when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. In the end, I loved him and hated him. This was how Will was convincing. I thought Ben was being a big jerk to Ezra, a blind man who just tried to go his way in the world. Why he was treating Ezra so was also made clear later in the film. Wait for it though. Everything in this movie: Wait. <br /> <br /> Ben is a fundamentally good person who has made a big mistake that he will not forgive himself for. It's still not clear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to get rid of his own guilt, or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but also get rid of the past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he's doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Good work Will.
