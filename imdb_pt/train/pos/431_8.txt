Start slowly, showing the sad lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up on it. Nothing happens much, but time passes in an excellent way, and there are innumerable astute jokes (my favorite is the carriage in the storm, which I find hilarious). The film is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the setting is beautiful (like Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the film are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes some liberties with the film. book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie version (may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like feeling when is well done). <br /> <br /> An excellent film, especially as a date film during bad weather.
