Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and siblings especially because of financial problems. He is crazy about having his own house and his own rules, since his brothers always stole his money and his parents neglected his desires. One terrible day, Preston was riding a bicycle; It was the same day that the villain in the story, Quigley, was trying to escape the police and accidentally ran the car on Preston's motorcycle. Needing to stay away from the police, Quigley hastily gives a check to cover Preston's motorcycle damage. The problem was: it was a blank check! Preston is a smart kid and decides to have a high price on that check: 1 million dollars! All this money gives Preston things he's always wanted, such as a mansion with a pool, lots of toys and even a limo! Problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston a difficult situation and facing many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
