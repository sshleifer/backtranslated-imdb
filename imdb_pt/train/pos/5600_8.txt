This is my kind of movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. But it's also a dark comedy. While I see it primarily as a terror / suspense, there will be others who may see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But anyway, it's a fascinating descent into madness. The end caught me off guard, but what a final! This leaves the viewer too much to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a great screen full of awe and traces of humor, and a mysterious atmosphere make this a movie worthy of being seen. Personally, I think I need to watch this over and over again to understand and understand all the subtleties that are inside. But it's like a movie that will be a pleasure and not such a chore to do.
