This movie is so old that I never realized just how young Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember him playing in a great movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not overjoyed that their father and mother break up and find out that their father is going to marry a young blonde girl who is a prospector who only looks for a rich daddy. They hire a man to pose as a very wealthy earl, his name is Earl Ariszado, (Misha Auer), who is drunk all the time and has no money and gives lots of comic laughter throughout the film. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was registered at a police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star and then Penny began singing with the most amazing soprano voice I've heard, all police department and the convicts began to applaud, which was a very fun and entertaining scene of this film. This is the first film debut of Deanna Durbin and she became an instant success overnight and became a big movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
