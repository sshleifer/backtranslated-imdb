I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was the winter season in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girlfriend in a shoebox of an apartment. can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink too much and watch anything that appears on television. I found this movie outside of a used-goods store that stood on a snow bank and right away it was a treasure. The worst movie of all time. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We have seen so many times that we sometimes turn the television sideways or upside down, for a more complete filling effect. The laughter will come and the memories will last forever. If you see this movie to rent in a video store, steal it. You will not regret!
