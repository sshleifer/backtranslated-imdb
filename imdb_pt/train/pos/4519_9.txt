Julie Waters is excellent and Adrian Pasdar is a very warm, very real and extraordinarily interesting revelation about the complications that gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in the life of a young executive. At the center of this film is the true truth that you must accept yourself before you expect others to accept you.
