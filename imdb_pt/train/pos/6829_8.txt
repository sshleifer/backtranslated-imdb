Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses control of reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of her. She becomes increasingly deluded from reality and as a result, her emotional turmoil interferes with her work as an actress. In the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything but still manages to engage her audience, it makes the film interesting (albeit a little important) as a parallel to Cassavette's own struggles as a filmmaker. There are so many ideas out there, and as a result it gets a bit confusing (I'm still thinking about the relationship between the dead fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented in its crudest form makes it a challenge. consistently interesting and thought-provoking film. It would be great on a double account with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
