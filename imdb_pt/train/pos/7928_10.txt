Let's get some things first: zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can make them walk, run, even fly if he wants to. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so original. I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie, again zombies do not exist, so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants to. The zombies in this movie look pretty good, but obviously they have not decomposed since they died! They are very confused and full of choppy faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half-eaten cat. It seemed so real that my daughter cried when she saw it. This movie received very good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, which made me want to go see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the likes of real horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
