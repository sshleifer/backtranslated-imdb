The unsuccessful middle-aged deputy public prosecutor George Maxwell (an excellent performance of George E. Carey, who also produced this photo) no longer supports his frail and shamefaced wife Edith (a perfectly bitchy Anne Bitchy). Worse yet, poor George is still overwhelmed with a newborn sun and a lascivious lesbian teen daughter (dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous affair with the adorable, seductive and laid-back hippie nanny Candy Wilson (deliciously touched by the sexy demeanor of the hot blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications happen when George finds himself being blackmailed by bitter Julia Freeman (a very venomous turn of Kathy Williams), who wants George to create his psychotic boyfriend, Laurence Mackey (a scary Robert Tessier, who has a head full of hair here). jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yes, the same guy who played Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty fill the splendidly obscure story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious feminine nudity, soft sex and raw violence. In addition, they accurately depict all the uninhibited sensibility of the youthful culture of the 60s and relate the plot in a tight time of 75 minutes, thus ensuring that this film is no more than welcome. A definite highlight comes when Candy invites her friends to the Maxwells for an impromptu party in the basement, with marijuana, rock music and, of course, nude hot girls. Robert O. Ragland's fatal track hits the spot. Stanton Fox's hard black-and-white cinematography adds an extra edge to delusional contemptuous events. Best of all, this movie ranks as a wonderful showcase for the charming and fresh Pixie Patricia Wymer, who positively illuminates the screen with her sweet, bubbly personality and captivating beauty. A total trashy treat.
