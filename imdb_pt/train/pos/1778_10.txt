I just want to say that I'm so happy that someone finally spilled the beans in this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous farce of making movies. Especially for a student film! I just want to give Spazz credit for taking the amount of absurd time of care to find such a rare image, and then COMMENT ON IT! Most people I know do not have that kind of time, especially few will finish reading it. Many compliments to you! Either way, the film follows a fine storyline that is at least unbelievable and simply silly. I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charlie's Angels, but why hire such atrocious actresses! Also, what kind of director does he act, write, produce, and also edit the photo! Pick a job and put all your love on it, man! It's a shame, because I heard he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz for removing the curtain from this movie, people like you are a rare find.
