When I was young, I had seen very few movies. My parents, in all their wisdom, have rented this. I was very cautious about what the movie was, actually I was not even allowed to watch. My brother and sister arrived, of course, and it made me very angry. So, what did I do? Late at night I destroyed the VCR! He kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported vandals. I was arrested, of course, I could not get my foot off the television before the police arrived. I just received a stern conversation and sent it home. My parents abandoned me, of course, and made me work to pay off the debt to the TV and VCR. It destroyed me, slave labor really sucks, believe me, but I had to do it. Tasks around the house. What happened in the end? We have a large screen TV, DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? Easy I made movies and sold to Disney! Do you remember Finding Neno? Well, I wrote this movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks! They rewrote the plot, of course, and did it in CGI, because they could not afford to make it a real-life action photo like I did! In the end, I've never seen the movie The Head that did not die and the rating I gave is my rating of life! You're doing great!
