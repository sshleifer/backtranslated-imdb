This is an amazing movie and all the actors and actresses are very good! Even though some of the actors and actresses were not very popular in show business, it seemed like they were acting since they were 1 year old! It was funny, disgusting and just a really good movie. In most places, I just did not know what would happen next! I was like I think it's going to happen, wait, I think this is going to happen. All ages will love this movie! In some places I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some places I was totally disgusting and I could not believe what I was seeing! I'll definitely see this movie again! It's one of those movies where you can not be boring. Every time you see it is so full of suspense. I definitely recommend watching this movie !!
