For a long time I have not seen such a beautiful animation feature. Having a healthy respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other film made by them can not be compared to that. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the background is breathtaking, almost every object in each frame is drawn perfectly. Sometimes I felt shivers down my spine - both I loved what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the animated film can be. The characters are adorable, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, pedestrians, rocks and rules! The other characters are very good too. The humor is first rate. <br /> <br /> Generally it seems that the creators did not invest much effort in this. I mean, it looks like this was not much different from the people at Pixar and Dreamworks, who try hard all the time to think of something new. And I'm very happy that a product of the European animation studio has been so good. They made a magnificent and moving film, a sweet for the eyes and the heart. <br /> <br /> The only downside is the stupid start and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10
