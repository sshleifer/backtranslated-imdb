After reading tons of good reviews about this movie, I decided to take it for a spin (I bought it on DVD, hence the "spin" pun ... I'm an idiot). The beginning was all I expected, a perfect set-up (along with some quotes I've heard on the albums of Various Wu-Tang) for what should have been a good movie. But the story I heard was so big, so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except the Lizard) I guessed what Venom he was. Also, the only cool character is killed in the middle of the movie. Okay, so the plot was not very good, but at least there was some good kung-fu, right? Wrong. The fights were very short and few and far between. Granted the different styles were all pretty cool, but I wish the fights would be longer. I kept hoping to see the Lizard running and doing some crazy things on the walls, but that never happened. I was hoping to see the centipede do a little quick, but this never happened. I was hoping to see Scorpion in the movie for over 7 minutes in total, but that never happened. In short, not much happens. The fight is very routine. Do not be fooled just because this movie has a plot, that does not mean it's a good movie.
