This is one of those movies that they did a lot promoting for. If you watch TV, then you also can not watch the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one that happens to be Jennifer Annisten being the funniest. It's the typical Jim Carrey mood and it's very funny. Just do not go see this movie expecting to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a must-see, otherwise just watch the previews and you will be so pleased.
