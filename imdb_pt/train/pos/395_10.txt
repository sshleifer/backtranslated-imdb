Visually stunning and full of Oriental Philosophy, this incredible martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best movies that Hong Kong cinema has produced. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but it's a refreshing change from films that treat their audience like they're idiots. If thinking is not your forte, however, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go see Hollywood's latest studio at the brain club, but if you're looking for something else, it's where you'll find it.
