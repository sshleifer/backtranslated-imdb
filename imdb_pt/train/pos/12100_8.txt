The DVD of "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very strange. That's because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed English by the French. Sometimes the characters alternated between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to make the film simply subtitled or simply dubbed it, it did not matter! Strange, but still watchable. <br /> <br /> The story is intended to be based on a story of Poe, although I can not remember which. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and end of the movie - though it did not seem especially to him. <br /> <br /> A rich man makes a bet with a guy on his luck that he can not stay all night one way at home. It seems like an easy win to win - even if the house is very scary. However, it can not be that easy, as the rich guy says that all those who previously accepted the bet have died - still, this idiot still wants to bet! While at home, he meets the lovely Barbara Steele inside and falls madly for her. Later, however, he discovers that she died more than a decade before! How can this be ?! I could tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to ruin the suspense. See for yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie has very high ratings to create a scary atmosphere. The house, black and white cinematography, and music work together to create a scary-looking movie. As for the plot, it's interesting - especially because there are so many twists - so many you're wondering who you are and who's not among the undead at the end of the movie. <br /> The only downside is that I felt sorry for the poor snake who was unnecessarily dead. As crazy as it may seem, I felt sorry for him and hardly seemed necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, parents may want to know that, in the end, there is a bit of nudity. A beautiful woman appears topless, but is hardly necessary for the plot.
