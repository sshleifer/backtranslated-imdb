The Muppet's third film is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with the gang taking its modest college musical to the bright (but volatile) lights of Broadway, full of typically naive optimism. Of course the first attempt fails and Kermit (group leader and author of the show) blows his top; Thus, all others follow separate ways so that he does not need to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young aspiring fashion designer who ends up paying for serving food at his father's restaurant (the old man then has a line in non-particularly twisting sequences!). We received the usual appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a trustworthy cheater), Elliott Gould (who was also in the movie Muppet [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself - having her portrait in an elegant restaurant replaced by Kermit, sporting fake mustache, as a ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (in possibly the funniest scene in the movie as a Broadway producer, before whom Kermit appears acting like a sapper and wearing hilarious tones and an afro wig!). The other Muppets go more or less by their typical rhythms, with (sadly) less space given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is something of a taste acquired with me, the scenes in which the latter spies what it takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress? and especially your violent reaction to it? are undeniably funny. What disappoints, however, is the climax itself (after a redundant retreat in which Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up publicity on Madison Avenue) that, instead of the expected routines, gets nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his wife. eternal flame Miss Piggy!
