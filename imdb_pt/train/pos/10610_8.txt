A sweet-natured mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) finds an abandoned girl in the woods and immediately falls in love with her. The town elders usually support him to keep the child, although a local seductress (Cara Seymour) thinks little of the new family. A little girl determined on a long walk and a sinister street vendor (David Strathairn in his creepy) have parallel stories that converge fatefully. This is a lovely slice of life in the Ozarks on the same line as "Where the Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three were filmed on location in those beautiful hills and covered the lives of simple-minded American people-but not simple minds. A minimum of strong language and brief but poignant violence makes this familiar view quite safe.
