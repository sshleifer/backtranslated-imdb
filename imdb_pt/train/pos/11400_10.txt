I felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the first page of the page of this movie because some of them were a bit wrong. <br /> <br /> Originally I posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was appropriate, given that this is the "comments" index and not a message board (although we used to use them like this before IMDb added the movie message boards), so I'll edit this to make it unnecessary. Well, first of all you might not be aware of it, but Gene Kelly was famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin "panorama" film, he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "two-shoe" roles he was playing in most of his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal "). Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to build a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". That gave Kelly a chance to play her famous Broadway role, though Warner beat MGM for "Pal Joey" rights. In my opinion, the WB movie "Pal Joey" is a disaster, although Sinatra is fit for the part, but other problems have sank the film (script changes and bad direction.) =========== === => = that Kelly's pictures are not well made, even citing her artistic education to prove the point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and is needed for the story / characters. that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even he knows it, although Milo has made him bolder to the point where he almost believes in her. But it's important that the audience is not sitting there saying "but, he's a great artist if he had the chance! "You want the audience to be fully aware of their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> So you complain that he sabotages his interest in the program; again you are not understanding the str utura the story. He refuses because he does not want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he is not really ready for exposure. His enthusiasm for the show is certainly not as great as Joey's enthusiasm for "starting a nightclub." But it serves the same function in the plot. Remember, it's essential in "Pal Joey" (the play) that Joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes he does not deserve it. Same with the art show. If Kelly's paintings were really good, that would hurt the whole point. ===================================================================== So you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry." I think it's in the eyes of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but to me everything was fine. Compare her to even more "forced" novels like Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion." ===================================================================== When you say that the grand finale of dance has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it just shows that you have not dug beneath the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements of the dance sequence relate to the story and the characters, and through the dance the plot is solved through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The symphony movements are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships. If you have not seen it, it's not the movie's fault. Certainly not a "bunch of crap". =====================================================================
