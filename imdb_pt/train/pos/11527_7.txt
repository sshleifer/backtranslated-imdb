Miriam Hopkins is "The Red Haired Lady" in 1940, in the biopic film of Mrs. Leslie Carter, starring Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne and an excellent cast of supporting players including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really made us feel for Mrs. Carter. The rains are great as the extravagant and selfish producer / writer / actor / businessman David Belasco, one of the big names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, acted as counselor in this film is a poor representation of the actual events of Mrs. Carter's life. It is true that there was a very publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly seen as a scandalous character for this and for becoming an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody battle. Once she broke up with Belasco, she did not return to him and, in fact, started working in vaudeville and actually made some movies at the end of her life. She actually married Lou, and he became her main character in many productions. <br /> <br /> The driving force for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this movie is regaining custody of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from him, he is completely attached to his father. In the film too (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which gives the film an interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a representation of the greatness of Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in the Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot braids. Off the stage, fans blew her hair as she stood 35 feet above the stage holding the center of a bell to keep him from touching. Very visual.
