After a cold-blooded scene between Andy and Gina in South America, we know that Andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a difficult economic situation where he urgently needs some extra money ?? Have we also discovered that he has stolen from his job and using money for his drug habits? He is also trying to accompany his wife, who just might be having an affair? <br /> <br /> To solve all his problems, does he convince his brother - a sympathetic loser - to join him on a plan to steal the small shop from his own parents? Are your parents well-married and owners of a jewelry store located in Westchester County, New York? Is sixty thousand dollars all you need to take your life out of despair? <br /> <br /> Three main characters are important in this movie? <br /> <br /> First the two brothers? Each of them is a complex individual, threatened with multiple motivations and plunged into doubts and disappointments? Are the two characters desperate financially and emotionally? <br /> <br /> Is Andy selfish ?? Does he feel he has never had the love of his father? He is the corrupting influence, turning his brother into an assailant, and his beautiful wife into an adulteress. <br /> <br /> Is Hank a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes? His ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money, since he owes her hundreds of children on board. Does he want to regain the trust he once had with his father? <br /> <br /> The third character is his tired and deplorable father, Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), especially in the scary climactic scenes. <br /> <br /> Saying more about the details could lessen the impact of the movie, and therefore the entertainment ... <br /> <br /> Tomei's performance conveys great depth and excitement, even with his look, your touch, your particular move ?? <br /> <br /> Lumet's direction is firm, fresh and brutal.
