After reading just two of the comments here, as a Bronte fan, starting with Olivier's Heathcliff, and supporting the many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester," it is more than revealing to see that it is the UN- to lie to the chauvinist-chauvinist period the inhabited trio. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of nineteenth-century British domesticity is that the "girls" were all "spinsters" and their only realistic brushstrokes with "men" were their vicarious father and their forgiveness? brother. That said, finally, it is ANNE Bronte who, in her only essay, proved the "feminist" point, far ahead of contemporary types, and including the "ranking of the voting franchise." However, the story evinces more than a few that preceded it, including the Greek heterai and Sappho and the likes of a former emperor, Yang Kuei-fei. What about "Eve" and her apple?
