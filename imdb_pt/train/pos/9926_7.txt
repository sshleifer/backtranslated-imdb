Kiera Nightly went straight from the P & P set for this action movie ... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. A big hit in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic, she is, once again, "take a chance". Just as his bikini-clad warrior King Arthur was more skin than muscle, it's hard to imagine this delicate frame resisting the lives of bounty hunters ... but that's exactly what Domino Harvey did, and Me (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) I believe she carries it out. <br /> <br /> Things... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (to the non-American world) is the zip code of Beverly Hills in Los Angeles where all the stars in the movie live. * Domino Harvey's most famous film was the Manchurian candidate (who appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of drug overdose in his bath before the movie's release in June 2005 after being arrested for drug trafficking. She had just completed the negotiation so that some of her songs would be included in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to the sexuality of Domino Harvey in his interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this film a little improbable, then check out Domino Harvey, since the facts are more amazing than fiction.
