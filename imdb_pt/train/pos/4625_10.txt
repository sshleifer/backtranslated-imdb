Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most amazing and delicious film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California, as I recall, where inmates rehearsed and did a different piece of Shakespeare every year for the past 14 years. The film follows the production of "The Tempest" from the cast live, and in the process we learned some incredible things about these men, who are the most serious of the crimes. The truth is actually stranger than fiction - if someone tried to adapt that story to a fiction movie, the audience would never buy it, but knowing it's real makes it breathtaking to watch - literally; I gasped aloud when I heard of the crime of a particularly talented criminal. It's like a crazy episode of Oz, and even more fun because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
