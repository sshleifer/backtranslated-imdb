Although not as famous as some of his other collaborations (like THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a little horror movie, although the selection decisions have been a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays dr. Janos Rukh, a weird scientist living in the Carpathian mountains - near Dracula's hometown. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose nationality was never discussed, though the name certainly looks French. I really think it would make sense to have both exchange roles, since the role of the Carpathians seems tailor made for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual turnaround, the two still did excellent work. The role of Karloff was definitely the main one, but Lugosi did well as a relatively normal person - something he did not play very often in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a little outcast, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are bizarre and meaningless. However, throughout the film, Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new compliment to Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh has discovered has the unpleasant side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (do not you hate it when that happens?). While this might just have been a simple friendly scientist turned into crazy storyline, the plot was well constructed, the characters well developed and the crazy Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional but complex and interesting killer. <br /> <br /> Movie is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror movies. You can actually say that Universal Pictures took away all the barriers and made a bigger budget movie instead of the cheap cockroaches that Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately gravitated to in recent years. Good thing.
