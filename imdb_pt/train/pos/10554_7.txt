NOTHING (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange premise from the director of the movie "Cube". This time around, there are two main characters who meet and their house transported into a mysterious white void. There is literally nothing outside of his small two-story house. Intriguing to be sure, but I thought the comedic tone set for this movie from the start was extremely poorly conceived. There needs to be some humor, certainly ... and I have no problem with the humor that ended up being derived from the situation of our two heroes (their last showdown was definitely a hoot) ... but I really think the movie It would have been much better if it had become more rooted in reality in the beginning. After watching the movie I watched the movie "Making of" on the DVD and a small trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the more "silly" comic aspects ... making it look like a completely different (and a little better) movie. The last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together ... similar to the recent movie "Primer." The actors are fine when they are not exaggerating in the comedy. They are really very believable in their most "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this movie as a failed experiment halfway ... but that conquered me to the end. (And keep watching the credits for the final scene ... just do not ask me to explain.)
