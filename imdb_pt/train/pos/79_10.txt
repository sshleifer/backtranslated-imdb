I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's a shame that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not show up. She was excellent at the show. Of course Walter Brennan was great, just like Tony Martinez. I loved it when he called Amos Lord Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and can not wait to buy the Seasons 2-6. If there were more shows on television like this, everything would be better. This show briefly appeared in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless all the cast members that have left, and please, Llydia Reed, become known again to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
