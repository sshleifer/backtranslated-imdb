There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but I can not really do that, can I? This movie is a movie to watch, if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you get offended easily with swearing, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman, and this may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all his other premieres, I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I'm going to say. It's kind of hard for me to leave that comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word on almost every line that comes out of his mouth when they talk. So I'm keeping it professional. Best movie. Pull yeah !!
