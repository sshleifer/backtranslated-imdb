Mendez and Marichal provided us with a serious, compelling and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic, and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism generated in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have met, and yet, because our nation refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans may fade and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of Puerto Rico created, undermining the families, and the basic institutions that sustain any society. Corruption is rampant as people are not paying taxes (which has led to a fiscal crisis for this nation) and a sense of cynicism and mistrust pervade the island's culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a donation has allowed this painful yet powerful film to be produced. A must see. . .
