Those who love Elivra like I did on her late night movie reception duties will love this movie - she's just cool - her car is great, and she's a bit of Dolly Parton from Transylvania - she's so innocent and naive at times - and sexy all the time - more, more than a touch of Mae West - sets are well made too, and the comedic cast is great with Edie McClurg at her best ever - more Sally Kellerman as Patty is hilarious. Every time I have to do something for a filling, I'll think of how Elvira chews the fries - This movie is to be seen again and again - just for fun. Now I have to get the sequel, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if she lives up to this ----
