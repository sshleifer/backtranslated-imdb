The documentary begins with the setting of perspective for several light-years. The traveler is traveling through our Milky Way with the sounds of our earthly lives as a spatial monument to (possible?) Aliens. <br /> <br /> The documentary contains images by Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J. B. Lenoir. The filming of J.B. has never been published before. The narrative is "Blind Dixon Willie." However, it is done by an actor. The film shows the work of all these first bluesmen followed by covers and interpretations of musicians such as Nick Cave and the bad Seeds, among others. <br /> <br /> The death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is a landmark event in history. Lenoir became politically involved and is considered to be the league of Martin Luther King and his peers. His political interests can be found in the themes of his letters. <br /> <br /> The blues is the native song 'THE' of America. Blues are the roots and the rest are the fruits. <br /> <br /> The title 'Soul of a Man' is a song by Willie Dixon.
