This review arrives almost 30 years late. However it has to be mentioned that I happen to make a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watch it over and over again for 4 months in a row! I just had to write about it! I was injured and forgot about anything else I saw when I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see the ugliest male protagonist in literature portrayed by the most handsome man! still, what a welcome irony! This served me perfectly and even more so because Timothy Dalton did his work justice. He delivered an amazing and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like it! All the other actors are also very good. The whole movie was beautifully arranged. I do not care what anyone says about this movie. I just love and love it! That made me happy and satisfied. It crushes me a bit to say this, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A & E's P & J, which I believe to be the best mini-series. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre's excerpts scared me a little at school. I never got to read the book seriously knowing the story so well. Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and led me to an almost frenzy. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously, which of course is a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole staff and especially to Mr.Dalton !! This movie is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> I give you a 10/10 grade.
