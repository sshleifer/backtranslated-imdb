FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry into the genre nunsploit - sleaze of equal parts, feminist journey and "history" as we follow Flavia on her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We started with Flavia in a convent. She is not very happy because she does not believe in all the male "rules" and machismo of the world around her and escapes the convent with her Jewish friend, Abraham. Both are finally captured and Flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another "non-believer" nun while accelerating a Muslim invasion. Flavia leaves with the Muslims who take the convent and they are "occupied" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. Eventually, the expansion of the Muslims and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another singularly brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> This has pretty much all the things I like to see in a 1970s exploration film - something good, including nipple removal, and a good leg skin scene, some decent nudity - including the full-frontal requirement, and a decent storyline as well. I'll say that sort of dragged on some points but not enough to get really bored with it. I would definitely recommend this for nunsploit / 70's exploit fans ... 8/10
