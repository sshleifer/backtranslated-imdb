I love this show as action filled with adventure, love and intrigue. Well, sometimes love! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very good to see Dick Van Dyke in a role on television since I saw him in Mary Poppins. the mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve, is very appealing to the public. This is a show you have to watch!
