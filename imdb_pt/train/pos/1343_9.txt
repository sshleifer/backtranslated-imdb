Thre is not a single Scorsese movie that I would put on a list of my favorite movies. But that's the best thing I've seen on my DVD in about five years. Scorsese's patient elucidation about the moments of the favorite movie and how Hollywood works is incredibly graceful, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> There are 3 DVDs worth of material. It would have to be a British production, since everything about the American corporate culture would have run over the quiet, methodical, no-frills, post-focus-in-content approach that is adopted here. And an American production would have required him to say that he liked only movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone would take a page of your love of movies. You must love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic, and specific reasons. Not just more "I-too" votes for The Godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they did, the movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese knows what ideas are being explored, and that makes him an engaging and engaging speaker on the subject. I really appreciate your articulate and generous interviews over the last decade. On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he is excited to show him some obscure movie, rather than when he is teaching teaching something well established about the history of cinema. And I want him to pull those three hairs off the bridge of his nose. It's very disturbing.
