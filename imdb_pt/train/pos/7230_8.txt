"The Invisible Mouse" is a delicious and different Tom & Jerry cartoon. It features the usual cat / mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time around. Jerry accidentally falls into an invisible ink bottle and is obviously very happy about it because he realizes he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As much as it's weird, it's also really cool and fun to see what we can not see: Invisible Jerry. It's fun to see things rising in the air without seeing who is doing it (we know who, right?) - it's as if these things had life of their own or almost as a matter of ghosts. It's also fun to watch Jerry eating some candy and fruit while he's invisible. I really like this instrumental song that plays when it's not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes about this are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him and even when Tom tries to hit him with a frying pan. and Jerry writes "He missed me." I also like it when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, making it visible again and with a happy look on his face. <br /> <br /> Overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic design: humor, entertainment, fun and some pretty art too.
