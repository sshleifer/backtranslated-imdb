I was about 11 years old and I discovered that I live 0.48 km from his uncle's house. his uncle's house is in Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. they have added homes since the movie was made. I do not know the house number, but you can go look for it. Now I'm 21 and I like to watch this movie. the bar in Spencer is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school of your own. I drove through the house last week the house still looks great. My father and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where John cross the railway cracks they did 225 larger. When I hear of John losing his son I begin to think about when he did urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time.
