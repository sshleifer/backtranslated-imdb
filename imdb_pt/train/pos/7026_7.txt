When I was 17, my school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is not a big surprise, as it is a perfect material for high school and considered the most staged musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a student music and kept strong memories of the production and their songs, as well as a persistent disregard for the version of the Dick Van Dyke film that (deliberately) obscured Elvis' references and pitched him to a swinging audience of the 1960s. So when the 1995 version of starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was blown away by what I saw. Alexander performs in an exceptional performance as Albert, a performance in stark contrast to his most well-known personality from a particular TV series. The rest of the cast is amusing and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not seem her part, supposedly a naive and innocent student). <br /> <br /> But best of all, the musical familiar numbers of the show are all preserved in this film and performed as stage songs should be (allowing the absence of a stage). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie. The stage shows justice in a way that probably can not be improved, which is good enough for me. What is better than rendering a writer's work faithfully and with color and style?
