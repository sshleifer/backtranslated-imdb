This show was absolutely great, and I'm always looking forward to watching it. All the characters were funny and incredible in their own way, each and every episode provided continuous laughter, and it was completely fun and unlike many other shows. Everyone was absolutely insane and incredibly funny, that you could not help but love this show. There were a few dead-weight episodes, but the '70s show always managed to create some kind of nice atmosphere, where it does not really matter. This was one of the best shows that have ever been on the air, and I will attend this show whenever I can, because it never gets old, never gets boring, and never gets uninteresting.
