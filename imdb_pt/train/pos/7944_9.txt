Have you ever had, or have, a pet that was with you through thick and thin, who you would be lost and who you love, no matter what? Betcha never thought they felt the same for you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful and wonderful family movie. If you have a crush on animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid, and I think now, at sixteen, I love as much as I do. I could never decide on a favorite character, and still do not think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but hostile family. I love Chance, and as in the end he says he has a family in the past. Cheesy, yes, but you have to remember that this is to be a family movie, and it perfectly fulfills that role. Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader / model for the young and adventurous Chance. <br /> <br /> Animals outnumber humans, but of course most of the tearful moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie rescuing Molly, and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives every moment even more emotion and a swollen heart sensation. I give it 9/10. To be compared with (and even rated better than) Cats and Dogs and Babe.
