I started riding very recently and, like anyone who has ever surfed, I should fall in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life with as much horse-related material as I could, and I was amazed at the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a Disney movie to feel good about. with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got was an incredible movie, full of beautiful scenery and animation, and an incredible plot that has the great potential to warm someone's heart. The spirit is a wild Mustang in the Wild West, whose entire world is crumbling around him when he discovers that humans are slowly taking over their homeland. The story unfolds with a wide variety of characters, some humans, some animals, all are well written and most are nice to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a good story, and who appreciates history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but I feel important, is that the animals in this movie do not talk. This was a really nice vacation from the animated films Lady And The Tramp that everyone is accustomed to today.
