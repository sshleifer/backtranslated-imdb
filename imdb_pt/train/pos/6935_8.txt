James Stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge that relates to the fate of other stars' films, the Winchester Rifle. It's obvious that Stewart is adding an excellent obsession to his usual cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after being beaten in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting. <br /> <br /> We found a selection of players, gunfighters, Indian traders. and bank robbers as we follow the path of rifles through Indian battles, bank robberies, and so on. The supporting cast is all solid with Dan Durya standing out as Waco Johnny Dean the live captain with a finger on the trigger. Also as a trivia note a very early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian chief. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought long range and around a rocky outcrop. Play a good old western action, hand fights, shootings and horse chases for a fun western adventure. 8/10
