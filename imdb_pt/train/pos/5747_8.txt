If you have some kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a difficult movie to watch, at least in the second half of it. <br /> <br /> It is in this segment that we see a handsome little boy being beaten and then a retarded (with mental problems) coming out of the bottom of the pit after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It's not nice stuff. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and the acting is good too. The story will stay with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is the mentally handicapped guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this may be Hulce's best role. He is taken care of by a medical student, "Eugene," played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner's "Field Of Dreams." Dominick is a good junkie who reads "Hulk" comics and loves wrestling. He's the kind of "slow" guy you can not help but love and hope to live a happy life. When he goes crazy, it's for several good reasons and ... well, watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to get into a real emotional roller coaster and possibly get very upset about some things you see.
