La Teta i la Luna describes the life of a boy of 9 to 10 years named Tete, who is obsessed with breasts growing in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna's films (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life is at this age. Also being from Catalonia (Northeast of Spain), brought many memories to my mind. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, good life and especially many non-tense people.
