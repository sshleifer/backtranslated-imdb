For those who think it is strictly humor and immaturity, you are in fact the unconscious. Although the program contains its share of jokes, it also contains a lot of satire and mocks social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, and so on. You just need to read a little more of your material to get it. <br /> <br /> What I love too is that not everything is a joke. For those hoping for a joke formulated as Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to get her humor, which is more realistic. We do not walk around in this world and we have witty punchlines for everything that was said, which is in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in that regard. <br /> <br /> So do not take this as irrational humor because it is so much more than that.
