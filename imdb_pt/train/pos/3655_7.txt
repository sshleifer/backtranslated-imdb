De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this was a hit-and-miss for me. A smiling young idiot becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It is a detailed and brilliant story of the innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and happy police forces, but slowly evolves into a tale of magical fantasy, while the boy imagines that Toto develops unlimited powers of superheroes. I've had it so far with the always smiling Toto after 10 minutes, and when the magic took over, I was left in the dust. There were so many beautifully orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers, that I kept thinking it was a waste of the film not being more serious with its material. The coupling of neorealism and fantasy emerges more as a "see what we can do mommy" experience than as a fully developed piece of work / art.
