I really found this movie 'interesting'; finally worth my time to watch and rent. It's true ... some scenes were exaggerated in emotion, shouting, etc., but what movie does not emphasize the agenda, the genre or the "ax to grind"? Almost none! What struck me is that I read a review elsewhere made by a reviewer S.Fran on another review site, but found his negative comment instead of a more accurate description of his "own" review of the film; not the movie at all. Anyone watching this movie will realize that it's great to recommend family and friends; no car chases, yes !! Being "in" an Italian family, I can totally relate to the environment portrayed on the screen. The movie also has its shattering parts. It's what real life can be in such an environment. Good movie.
