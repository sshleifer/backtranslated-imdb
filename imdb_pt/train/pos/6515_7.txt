I almost did not rent this because of all the bad reviews, but anyway. I thought it was similar to falls from the darkness that I also liked. The only part I hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh but this was not a comedy. This ruined the film a bit for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was like a horror or suspense movie should be. The make-up was good and I saw much worse movies then this one. It was a simple story, with credible acting. It's not the scariest or the craziest movie, but I was not so keen or wanting a refund after watching it. On the DVD there were previews of other movies that look good and I'll watch them.
