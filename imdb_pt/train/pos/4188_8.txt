Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had a very inconsistent policy in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisies and madness of America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrayal of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" painted the war as the necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street. " "It's about the dangers of communist spies." All his films are very entertaining, and although often labeled b-filmmaker, Fuller was as good as any of the big studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception , and despite the dated themes, the film-making style is way ahead of its time. It's also a very fast, tight, and occasionally brutal noir film. The acting across the line is fantastic Richard Widmark is a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is sexy as a girl who works for his communist spy boyfriend.The stealer of the show is Thlema Ritter, however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie.The angles that Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences even more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for the time.) The camera moves continuously, just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. " Pickup on South Street "is a great noir thriller with action rhythm. "Shocker Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but that's a very close second. (8/10)
