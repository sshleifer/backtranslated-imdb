There are so many Hollywood movies made right now that they are not just tortures to watch but they also have no influence on anyone's life, whatever. Certainly, movies do not always have to have deep meaning, but it's good to know that there are still filmmakers out there who care about telling "human" stories. I will not give the premise of this brilliant film, however, the script is certainly one of the most complex and memorable I have ever seen in my life, and I am a 32 year old movie fan too! The Bug is in the top 10 of my favorites list which includes: On Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name but a few. This movie "on the move" should become one of your favorites too - that is if you have a heart!
