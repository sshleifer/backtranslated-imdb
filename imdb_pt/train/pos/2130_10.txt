A wonderful film, full of excellent discreet performance and clear and crisp dialogue. What really sets the film apart, however, is this trend of sadness everywhere. The story is underscored by subjects, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing their job in a world where this has had disastrous consequences. Above all, it was created in a world that no longer existed, having been torn apart at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the movie is only a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with the comic scenes. Still, it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh rejection of Jimmy Stewart and watch her expression of pain as she responds that her comments were a remarkable blend of "poetry and meanness." It's funny, sharp and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten biggest screen comedies ever made.
