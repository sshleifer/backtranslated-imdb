This is one of the most incredible stories I have ever seen. If this movie had been directed by Larry Clark then this story about a school shootout would probably have been shown through the eyes of the killer and what drove that person to go crazy in the first place. Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shootout, and how that affected the surviving victims. <br /> I've seen Busy Phillips in other movies before, but her performance in this movie is by far her best. The only other movie I saw with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan", which made me almost not want to watch this movie, but she did a great performance herself. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I saw that could make me cry. Believe me when I say this does not happen very often. <br /> <br /> The Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's it.
