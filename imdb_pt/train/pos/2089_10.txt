"The Good Earth" is a great movie about which you do not hear much more. There are many great disasters and events, but it is also a love story not in love. All this happens in just over two hours, which is short by today's standards. The special effects and costumes are very good for the time period. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role. She basically has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and heartbroken. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are great. <br /> <br />
