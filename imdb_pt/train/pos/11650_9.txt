A long awaited 2002 film. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini starred in this film. The hype for this movie was toooooo loud .. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this movie it also gives some spiritual messages. But it also includes actions typical of Rajini, style, music, etc. It's a good entertainment movie and it gives good messages too. <br /> <br /> I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the script. It's a must-have movie. Do not miss it!
