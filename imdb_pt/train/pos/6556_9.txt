I really liked this movie. I am a single parent with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH my girl applied herself so well to solve crimes and help others! So for me, maybe this is the level of the Earth's fantasy. I read many Nancy Drew books in my teens a long, long time ago. Of course this character was cleverly played by Emma Roberts, but it did not resemble Nancy Drew I remember the books. This is due to the script, not the performance. <br /> <br /> Emma is a lovely teenager who plays a confident, hardworking and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not involved in the fashion competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot as well as not remembering Nancy Drew from the books, and trying to figure out what decade we are in. I read the IMDb overview before watching the movie while I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook in other movies. This is not one of your best roles, but I'll keep looking for more of her films. Rachael was too old to play this role, but does an excellent job as the central adult orphan for the mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with other reviews written here. Some expect perfect connection with books, some expect more credible situations or adult action movies. I have what I expected! Good well targeted entertainment for teenage girls, and their parents who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement. This is a PG teen movie, not James Bond! Which do you want for a model for your teenage daughter?
