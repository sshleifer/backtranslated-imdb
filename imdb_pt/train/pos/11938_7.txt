I like movies like this for your spirit, no pun intended. It's a decent and neat movie about a baseball team that's lagging behind, and a young fan wants them to win, since their hardened dad said it was the only way he could get back at him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the celestial herald Al, taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic film. This makes you smile and really involves you in the sport. <br /> <br /> There's my complaint. the only thing that bothers me is these sports movies that turn you into an unexpected fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just think it's strange that I should leave the movie thinking that the Angels are a strong and cool team, when really my basic loyalty, as it is, is with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's really interesting. If it's just a movie about a team of losers, then it's okay.
