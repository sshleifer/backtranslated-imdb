As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I love you with very high expectations. I left willingly with all my expectations fulfilled. It was funny, sweet, quick and fun. The film begins with two taxi drivers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area, but discussing which way to go. That was funny, and so the movie goes into some of the best skits I've ever seen anywhere. There were four incredible of all good ones. Those four I'm going to start talking. One of them presents Shia LaBeouf as a messenger in a hotel that finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music producer who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another account with Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to the ball, with the character of Thirbly being disabled. The best of them features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an old quarrelsome couple. I will draw your attention to the fact that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut, and writes a skit about a janitor, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirt and a prostitute. New York, I love you is definitely so good, if not better than Paris Je'Taime 2006. The skits are well paced and the movie shows how indie movies should be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as the Paris Je'Taime, and that's why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, watch some great dramatic effects, watch an incredible amount of great performances, and just have fun, then definitely go see New York, I love you.
