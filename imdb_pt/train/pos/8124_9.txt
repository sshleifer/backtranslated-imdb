In addition to the great film METROPOLIS, it is the oldest pure science fiction film. While sometimes the film is a bit pragmatic and the acting may be a little broad, it's a great movie for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no movies I can think of that look alike. Second, in turn, the special effects were absolutely incredible - using faded paintings, models, and large molds to create incredible scenes of a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of the future. Sure, you could sit and hit the movie because, by today's standards, the effects are just more or less. But, you must understand that this was the state of the art when the film was released in 1936 and must have really impressed the audience. In many ways, the scenarios seem very reminiscent of the "modern cities" presented at the 1939 FAIR OF THE WORLD. I think the film is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "are people really THAT stupid? " or are we destined for greatness? "The final result seems to be a little bit of both!" As it is true! A final note: I saw this twice on TV and a short time ago on video.All three times the sound quality and the print stinks - particularly the sound.If this is available on a DVD, we expect it to be much cleaner and provide optional subtitles.As the sound in the video continued to cut, I really would have appreciated it!
