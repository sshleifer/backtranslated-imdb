I finally got my wish to see this in a movie theater. I had seen Fritz Lang's video footage a few years back. I was hoping that the ideal sorting conditions would work out its magic. <br /> <br /> Conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Ontario. Complete and pristine print. Intertitles in the original gothic-script German with simultaneous translation in English, accurate without being very literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie spat for a while, but in the end failed to capture, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This movie has no real relation to the Wagner Ring cycle, as I already knew, but some can not. Wagner had adapted the 13th c. Niebelungenlied for their own purposes. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - has much that will be familiar to Wagner listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried's wife, Kriemhild, his marriage to King Etzel. (Attila), the Hun, and his desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the renamed Nibelungs, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the Wagnerian myth in his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This movie remains on Earth. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. The giant ensembles rival those of "Cabiria" (1914), who inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Its decoration establishes a new frame in the barbaric splendor. There is a huge cast of Huns and Art Deco Burgundians with scars. And battles. Battles that never seem to end. <br/> <br/> Kriemhild is very successful in his revenge plan. She manages to destroy everything around her. His loyalty to the martyred Siegfried does not seem to be sustained either by love or devotion, but by something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted, "Disgrace me here." She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do. But Kriemhild does not exhibit normal human emotions, and certainly nothing equals the feminine principle. She is already "top full of cruelty misery," to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a furious look. I do not want to exaggerate, but that furious look is virtually the only expression to "cheer" on Kriemhild's face. It is the maximum in performances of a note. It is clearly intentional, however, not simply a case of bad acting. <br /> <br /> What we have to offer is a one-dimensional sketch of an avenging fury. Some may see Kriemhild as an authorized heroine. I just see the movie as misogynistic.
