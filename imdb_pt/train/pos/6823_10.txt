I spent the last week watching John Cassavetes movies - beginning with 'a woman under influence' and ending in 'opening night'. I'm completely and utterly impressed, in particular by these two films. from the first minute to the last on 'opening night', I was completely and completely absorbed. I've only tried it on a few occasions, but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasted about two-thirds, until the credits show up. everything about this film, from the way it was filmed, the incredible performance of Gena Rowlands, the credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the sense of depth, the rhythm, the tenderness, the originality, the characters, the skilful small moments .... for me, it is truly sublime. I could not agree more with the previous review about taking it to a desert island because the depth of this movie is something to be seen. If its bad enough to have a fire at home, I guarantee that instead of making one last attempt to rescue that stock of money under your bed, you will be saving your copy of this movie instead.
