Coming back from a shopping trip on Christmas Eve, an abused housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival after a disagreement with a group of young delinquents takes a violent turn. <br /> <br /> Suffering the indignity of a direct to the DVD release here in the UK, the premiere in the direction of Susan Montford may not receive the recognition it deserves. This is a shame, since the standard of writing, directing and acting is really very good, and certainly exceeds the quality of your average for DVD movies. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her the best performance at some time as the oppressed wife of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). Although Sheffer has really nothing to do but be a threatening presence, it is in his brief scenes that Basinger connects - showing a painful vulnerability but insinuating the anger that will eventually overflow in his confrontations with the young. It is a truly great and discreet performance, its transformation from victim to aggressor is perfectly reproduced. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas I initially thought was a miscast, since he (along with the other three young men) did not seem much of a threat. However, if all four young men had been more physically imposing, the later scenes in which Basinger would turn the tables against them would not have worked. The fact that these are four middling men, though somewhat unbalanced, is the key to making the movie work as well as it does. <br /> <br /> In addition to some rhythm issues during the second half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that really leaves the viewer with something to think about when the movie is over. Some may be delayed by the slow nature of the opening scenes, or the abrupt end. Others by the sometimes brutal violence. I say give it a try, it's certainly more deserving of your time than Saw V.
