I watched this Ralph Bakshi movie (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') one night ago at www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that the character designs are one today , but I think it's a satire and a very urban recount of old Uncle Remus stories that American black culture has created from the main characters to the glaring nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The Tar Baby" The Briar Patch. These are not biased stories, mind you, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I being a white woman, read and love those stories. And I also found interesting a view of the time capsule on black culture in Harlem, Nova. York in the 70's. <br /> <br /> Well, to get to the heart of this book: This movie is live action / animation film, which begins in live-action with a comrade named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacher (Charles Gordone) running to help his friend, Randy (Philip M ichael Thomas) to escape from prison but are stopped by an obstacle and end up in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy accidentally listened to fellow fugitive Pappy (Scatman Crothers), when he began to tell Randy about the lively story of Brother Rabbit, a young man who had just arrived in the big city, who rose quickly from the dark to rule the whole world. Harlem; you know, to me, Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action images, the film is a graphic satire and condemning stereotypes prevalent in the 1970s? racial, ethnic, and otherwise. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's another good Bakshi movie; and should we scan movies like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a pity; I think we should watch those films and learn about what happens at the time, how far we've come since.
