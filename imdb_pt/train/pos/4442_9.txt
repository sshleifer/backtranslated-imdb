The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and was not intended to be a sequel to Demons, since Lamberto Bava even mentioned it in the interview on the DVD Sheirk Show but was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80's rock, meanwhile it's more scary music and while the first two was bloody horror Demons III: The Ogre is an architectural horror and this is how Demons III is not a sequel suitable for demons , but I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The song is chilling and adds a tone to the castle in which the film takes place. The Ogre is something else because I like the movie. There are two other films that are classified as Demons III and that is Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good movie as long as you do not compare it to Demons and Demons 2.
