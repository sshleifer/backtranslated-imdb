I do not know if I'm just weird, but I liked this movie. Returning to Cabin by the Lake is of course the sequel to another of my favorite movies Cabin by the Lake. Actually, I think I liked this movie better than the first one. I also thought the cast of this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also liked the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming the script for Stanley Cabin by the Lake - it was not a completely redundant Stanley movie picking up other girls and drowning them. - If you're looking for some deep meaning then this movie is probably not the one for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, go ahead and watch. I've probably killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
