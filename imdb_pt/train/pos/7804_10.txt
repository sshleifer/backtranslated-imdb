I've been watching this movie over and over again. I have to attend at least once a week. I'm from Africa and looking at that movie taught me some things I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are all full of lessons for lifestyle people. I wish he were my own brother. I also saw and love your Mississippi Masala. What an exciting situation. When Denzel was trying to hook up his brother at work, he reminds me of my teenage years when my brother was always angry at me about being busy all the time. My brother always took care of my father and he wants to see me the same way. By the way, where did Denzel get that African accent in the movie Cry Freedom? I saw this movie for the first time in Africa and I did not know that Denzel was American until I moved here.
