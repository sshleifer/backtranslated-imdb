I saw this movie for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and being a teenager I found the film quite attractive. these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature, but with the right dialogue and trash, made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I recommend releasing and watching this movie. is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of high school, the high school record has reached the top of my list of favorites and hopefully get the chance to be released in theaters. I really thank all the kids who put the hard work into making this movie, it helped me to cry my eyes and laugh.
