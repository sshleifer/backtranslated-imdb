Although it was a very nice musical, what struck me about this film was the unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone as a composer and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Touching an absent-minded and distracted artistic type (far from his more familiar roles as menacing villains or the logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character seems unable to get out of bed without help. And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual Oscar Levant mood. By hiring Crosby as his ghost songwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck saying, "He does all my thinking for me," to which Levant replies, "Ah, it's just a part-time job." Of course this goes straight (or over) to Rathbone, who is very busy worrying about where his next hit song will come from. As another reviewer said, whoever knew Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad he had no more opportunity to show his comedic talent.
