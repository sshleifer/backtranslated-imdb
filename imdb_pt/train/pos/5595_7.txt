Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness that he explored to a tremendous effect on Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby in The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is Polanski's trademark - dark, shocking, unnerving - but there is something I'm not sure if this is deliberate or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not do himself justice here. As his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a bit disappointed with how few truly impressive cinematography cases are in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really leaves the movie Down is acting. Polanski certainly is not a bad actor, but seems to have bitten more than he can chew on Trelkovsky's difficult role. Some of the supporting castings are great, notably Melvyn Douglas as owner and Shelley Winters as concierge, but others are weak and miscast. It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all these supposed Parisians have an American accent. <br /> <br /> Very unexpectedly, there are some beautiful moments of somber comedy in the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedy actor. However, there are times when she falls dangerously close to being a parody of herself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) "transformation" is more likely to generate laughs than eyebrows, which diminishes what should have been a powerful moment in his psychodramatic journey. <br /> <br /> In short, The Tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, a little too languid for its own good. There are a handful of exceptionally cold moments and a consistently uncomfortable and ominous atmosphere, but this movie, while very good, does not hit the mark as successfully as it could. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of the day, a Polanski movie 'fine' is still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth watching, just do not expect to be surprised.
