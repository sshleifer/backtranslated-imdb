There is a very clever humor in this movie, which is both a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while it seems just an exercise in style (though big jokes like Balasko continue the Dussolier part and very good acting from everyone involved) and I was wondering why Blier made this movie. Everything is revealed at the end, when Blier, directing Claude Brasseur, receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven, and has a chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional capper and obviously sincere. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional entanglement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout its entire runtime. Some really nice scenes and sequences, however, and anyone who likes these "mostres sacr√©s" of French cinema, should really enjoy this movie.
