If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without the need to get into music every twelve minutes - then this is the Disney movie for you! My kids loved every minute of this movie, and I have to admit that I laughed several times during the movie. There are no sweet songs to disrupt a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovely and identifiable by themselves. This should be considered one of Disney's "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated landscape and its uninterrupted excitement!
