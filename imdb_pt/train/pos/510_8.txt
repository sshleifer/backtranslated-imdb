I only watched it for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten as much as the images were imaginative, and how witty the movie is. I had not forgotten the opening scenes that are (with the scene at Candlelight Club on Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history will love the makeshift references in the movie - anyone interested in romance will be driven by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual imagery will appreciate the representation of the other world. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie continues to be "Odd Man Out" done almost at the same time - but this is superb. <br /> <br />
