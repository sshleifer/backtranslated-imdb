Just kidding. In search of greener pastures in New York, Jon Voight is young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump type) Joe Buck of Texas. It does not take long for the Big Apple to swallow it without mercy and its ambitions, and soon Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and the cons of their street thugs. Given his pure heart, he pities one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves in with him on his apartment wreck and the two literally struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy in my opinion. It is, above all, a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie vibe of the late 1960s, with its obligatory Warhol cinematography and juxtaposing it with the ultra-urban New York City. The film shoves Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in the middle, emphasizing his position out of place. We feel for their fight to fit in, but also just to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> The Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes, for it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place leadership character and to some extent the Dundee Crocodile films since it deals with almost exactly the same kind of mood - a contrast among cowboy and cosmopolitan New Yorkers. Very attractive and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
