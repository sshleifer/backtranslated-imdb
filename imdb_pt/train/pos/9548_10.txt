It's an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Great work from Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to point at the play screen. Usually screen in most Turkish movies is not enough, but GEN has the best pictures to be said "perfect." And also the transition parts are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a great topic that influences everyone. Especially, a woman, who wants to be a psychiatric in a sanitarium, has a mother who is a habitual insanity. Main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you have to do is combine all the suggestions. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive piece of aggression that Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played. This performance may be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is, "Watch this movie, you're going to be confused"
