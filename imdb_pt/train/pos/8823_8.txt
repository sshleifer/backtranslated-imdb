Good movie. It tells a boy fantasy story, telling us how we are stuck in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one must take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: that you have to break all the rules if you want to break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation? It is also about fascism to decide on other cultural life, of what kind of culture that is stuck in our throats. Which gives Disney, FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide on our choice. Can not anyone have breakfast alone? Do we have to listen to the screaming NRJ, see the tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even had our breakfast?
