If the answer to this question is yes, then you should take advantage of this great movie. I just saw a few hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the film happens) and I still feel the enormous trauma that I received in the back of my eyes ... What a visual shock! I've never seen a beautiful black-and-white photo and such a drastic change in the way of making animated movies. I strongly believe there will be one before and after "Renaissance", similar to what we saw with the Pixar movies or with the Akira and GhostInTheShell experiences. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with some young people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) receives the success and recognition it deserves. Long live France!
