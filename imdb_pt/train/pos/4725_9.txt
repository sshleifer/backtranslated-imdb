Despite the lack of logic present in the plot, Kill Shot is a very nice film. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional divide between a wealthy working father and his wrong son. Each member of the support cast performs solidly, highlighted by the vivid performance of a young Asian whose name I can not remember. A shockingly tragic ending may infuriate some younger viewers, but as a whole, Kill Shot does indeed offer a deadly blow.
