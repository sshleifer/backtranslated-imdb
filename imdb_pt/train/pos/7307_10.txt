Set in a small American town, Halloween centers around the attempts of serial killer Michael Myers to track down his sister Laurie Strode, and in the process eliminates all her friends in brutal ways ... leaving poor Laurie to fight against Michael seemingly indestructible. This out-line plot has inspired countless knock-offs of terror throughout the 80's, 90's and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake.

Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of "sexually promiscuous teenagers being chased by a knife / ax / chainsaw / wielding psychopath ".
