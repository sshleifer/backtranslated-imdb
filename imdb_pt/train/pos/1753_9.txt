As we all know, the subgenre of sexual comedies is quite full. Simply being overly cheeky is no longer enough. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and deeds that a sex comedy really needs to have other good points to appeal to me these days. <br /> <br /> Entering the 40 year old virgin I knew basically what I hope; I've seen the commercials after all; "Is it true that if you do not use it, you lose it?" What I did not expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. There are still the strange "strange" characters we see so much in Adam Sandler's movies and there is still inadequate language enough to sink Noah's Ark, but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately to me) a person with whom I can relate. In the first scene I see that he even shares my love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the film we see his really elegant collection of antiques. Andy also has many video games and a working knowledge of movies and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers the bike. Most important of all; Andy is a nice person, he does not swear and respects women so much that he is away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone begins to think that he is a serial killer. It's like my life story. <br /> <br /> The other characters have funny stories to keep up with their slightly exaggerated personalities and everyone works at a certain level, but not the way Andy does. I felt it was kind of a distraction in a way, since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I suppose since I mentioned a flaw I could very well bring another notable to illuminate. History is intelligent, but predictable too, and as far as novels are concerned; it's very simple. He deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen in the end. Of course your final detour is a bit different from what we can expect, but you know what will happen in the end, and I guarantee you will. These are definitely small spots in the movie, but there is so much good here that I can easily ignore that there are few glitches. <br /> <br /> When I say "good," I mean "bad," of course. This is a sex comedy and wants to be bad. For the most part, I think it did. There are so many hilarious scenes as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with Trish's daughter to a sex education class, where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Oh, and we can not forget what will soon be the classic waxing sequence in the chest "Ooh, what's his name!" An interesting little note about this scene; actor Steve Carell actually waxed his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only took one take, but it was still a very brave thing on his part. <br /> <br /> In fact, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that he has now risen. on my list of respected comedians, which is kind of weird since I did not even know who he was before seeing this movie. I was so impressed with your writing, acting and time that now I really want to keep an eye on your future roles. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had doubts about this movie, but the first term was positive and I knew it was something I would eventually see. I'm happy to have participated as well, since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and it also works as something that you think is worth watching. It's not simply a series of sex jokes put together, but rather a series of sex jokes intertwined with a very interesting character and a truly moving novel. Now I'm sorry while I'm going to vomit my insides; I can not believe I just wrote this ... <br /> <br /> My commentary on Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
