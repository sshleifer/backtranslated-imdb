I just saw this movie at Turner Classic Movies last night and was impressed by the performance of Victor McLaglen: in every sense of the word, a "tour de force." The 1922 Dublin atmosphere evoked through cinematography and production design actually foreshadowed the techniques used in the best films of the 1940s and early 1950s. Much attention to detail as well; during the wake of Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford), the mourners are praying in Gaelic. Max Steiner's score is unforgettable. As in later films like the 1939 GWTW, he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and sense of place and time. John Ford: already a movie giant in 1935!
