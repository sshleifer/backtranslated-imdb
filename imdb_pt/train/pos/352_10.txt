I just saw "Valentine" and I must say it was the best horror movie I've seen in years. Contrary to the recent trend of horror films of the 1990s, this film is more concerned with being weird than being self-mocking. For those who hated "Scream", there is no reference to "rules of terror" in this film (even if the rules of the horror film apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect blend of horror from the '80s and' 90s. You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of the '90s movies, and the craziness of a 1980s movie. the year 2001 will finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were wanting. This is definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a fun character. You can tell she liked your role, and that makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
