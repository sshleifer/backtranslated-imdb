Wonderful romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who is planning to marry a man she is comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls in love with her stubborn and angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is clear with many big lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I've already been told) are perfect and cinematography is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. A must for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - both are fantastic and deserved the Oscar they received. A cute and funny movie. A must see!
