I thought the movie was actually very good. I liked the acting and it moved well. The director really seemed to understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to play, but it was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget, you need to take this into account when you're viewing it. There were some things that could be better, but most are budget related. The acting was very good the F / X and acrobatics were well done. A couple of highlights were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. This kind of movie has kept Los Angeles working and that's what worked.
