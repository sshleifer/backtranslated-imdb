Both my friend and I thought this movie was well done. We were expecting a light comedy, but we got a full-length action movie with comedic lunges. We both think that this movie may not have been so good at the box office, since the previous ones lead us to believe it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse always puts on a great acting job. Most of the support cast are veterans and not novices and they were solid. We felt the writing and direction were top notch and made comments to each other about the purchase of this movie. If you do not buy, rent it for a long time.
