Absolutely hilarious. John Waters' homage to the people he loves most (Baltimoreians) is a little song with lots to look at and laugh at. It's like being dropped in a kitsch museum! I have not laughed much in a theater since Mother Serial. I loved seeing old friends from the days of the Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, in front of the Waters camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Uses the best elements of previous Waters atrocities (especially the underestimated Polyester) and many new surprises. It made me sick in a wonderful way. Thank you, John!
