You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a family, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos, starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, daughter. Drew is lonely on holidays because he has no family of his own, so he rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, who I most remember for playing Maude's husband, Arthur, is hired to play Dudley, the grandfather. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The Valcos house is crumbling apart from Drew's situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make an amazing visit. You can not buy what you want! The acting and writing are mediocre, but the first-rate cast pulls it into the final scene.
