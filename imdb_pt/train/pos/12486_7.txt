Well, this movie is really hard. To be frank with you, this movie does not contain a lot of fascinating story, but that makes you 'want' to know how it will end ... but I'll tell you one thing now ... never again I've been so tense and jumped before in my life! This movie certainly makes the jumps and thrills! To be fair, I watched almost midnight, so I was kind of drowsy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was nervous ... or maybe it's because this movie really shows that aspect! It is basically about a couple that loses their child in a tragic event. They decide to move and rent a booth looking at thing in the mountains ... everything seems peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (I think it is the sister of the main character, and she brings her husband) ... at night , the husband hears noises ... he checks, and that's when things start to go wrong ... they do not stay for another day and tell the couple to leave as soon as possible, because something is not right ... to shorten a long story ... eventually they'll find out what happened in that house in the last few years and decide that it needs to be sorted out. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood blockbuster. , nore has a huge budget, but please do not let that put you off. It's scary, tense and very hectic! Just try :)
