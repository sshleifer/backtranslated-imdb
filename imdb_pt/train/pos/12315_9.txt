There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there are almost no reviews. This is because this movie is fantastic entertainment and has a bit of everything in it. <br /> <br /> It's maybe a little scary for the younger kids, but my 15-year-old son thought he was fantastic in every sense of the action, for the humor and even for the beautiful soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they are going to be seen regularly and now that this is finally available in the UK, I certainly add it to my collection.
