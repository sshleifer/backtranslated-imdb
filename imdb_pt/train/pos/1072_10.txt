I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The plot, though requiring some improvement, was very good, especially in the first season. The second season, however, has become more of a show of freaks and has lost the original charm of DA. The first line of the story was more interesting, a light side to life on the pony Jam while a serious plot focused with manticore chasing the X series. I was looking forward to new seasons, in fact I still am. I hope the guys at FOX and the DA production team realize that a lot of people still expect DA to make a comeback. Even after 2 years being canceled, DA can earn a lot if it works properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should take that challenge.
