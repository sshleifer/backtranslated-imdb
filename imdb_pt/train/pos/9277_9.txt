"Cinema is dead, long live the cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors at last year's Romanian film festival Anonimul, which reached its third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, the driving award went to "Offside", by Jafar Panahi. I have to see this tonight in Bucharest at the festival retrospective. The cinema is dead, but still very lively. Panahi's film convincingly tells how Iranian society looks. Digitally filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event that happened to Panahi's daughter: the problem and the risk taken when she decided to attend a football match. This is forbidden in Iran, as we are informed. What Panahi can do is to render with little means, but with probably much work, intelligence and humor, the cultural patterns of a society that places women on a different level. The absurdity of laws becomes comic. The film has a happy ending, after all, because the Iranian team is going to the World Cup. What I appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this movie. I would be very interested to see other Panahi films that were banned in Iran as well. I think he can be thought of as an activist director.
