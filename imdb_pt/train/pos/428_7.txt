Two women, tired of their controlling husbands, vacationing in Italy for a month with two other very different women. They come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful Merchant - Ivory movie. <br /> <br /> Great scenery and the location is not bad at all. Seriously, a very good piece of time 7 of 10
