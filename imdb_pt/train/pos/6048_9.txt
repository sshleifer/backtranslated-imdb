What a British cinema class! It was time. And a paralyzing comedy! <br /> <br /> Anyone looking to relive some of the freedom of their wasted youth, this road movie will be the ticket. <br /> <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail". and I "and" Easy Rider. "The movie runs at a solid pace and does not let you out for long ... Sometimes there are reflective moments but I think they are well justified and add to the characters that the actors I was a bit worried about the character of Phil Daniels at first, but fortunately I was beaten in the middle of what was one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie! I usually found myself belly laughing through the film, probably annoying some people <br /> <br /> I recommend it completely.This will become a cult British comedy.It is worth a visit.
