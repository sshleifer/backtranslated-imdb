A very silly movie, that starts with a soft porn sequence, ventures into a farelike comedy at the art gallery, adds a clash of a breakthrough in the hotel room and then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is bizarre and surreal (the particular timing scene is exquisitely unnecessary), culminating in a revealing ending that is as obvious as it is unfair to the viewer (see the curiosity section exactly why which is deliberately unfair). The film goes out of the way to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals, madmen and the wonderful racial stereotypes of the "Huggie Bear" style on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer as an idiot in the final scenes while the characters explain endlessly each other in great detail and repeatedly what happened in the film. Although the female background characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: Despite its many, many flaws, the whole package just, well, works.
