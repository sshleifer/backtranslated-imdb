Thho 35 year old, Groove Tube looks a lot like the current TV today! Specialized niche networks, a TV show about drug traffickers called Dealers (ala Weeds, and even prior to Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke 1978), strange beer commercials (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls), Dirty The Clown Boy Koko (Pee Wee Herman tones), even Chevy Chase making clown humor (a violent barbershop duo duo) a year before its debut in 1975 on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube an early X note, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking of hippies hitchhiking - For similar movies in sketch style, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and Everything You Know, from Firesign Theater, is wrong.
