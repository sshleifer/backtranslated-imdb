Wow, what an episode! After last week seeing Mellisa constantly making appearances about the friendship of Annie and Brandi, I almost threw up. But that was nothing until he saw Mellisa's speech after being fired. Watching her limping around her cast vomiting obscenities and screaming for someone to pick up her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing on the reality show. She kept shouting at the people off the set, so they would wear their "all" clothes as if someone else were wearing one of their hideous clothes. Mellisa you're like 40 years old and you still play tantrums? Then Joan begins to call Annie and Brandie all the names in the book, and gets up and leaves the show! Both Rivers are spoiled brats that have only been left on the show for so long to maintain ratings. Mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview, only proves to America what everyone thought, you're a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not do it my way! I love how Annie told the cameras she could manipulate Mellisa to think her way, and then did just that. Mellisa is by far the smartest competitor and clearly deserves to win the entire game.
