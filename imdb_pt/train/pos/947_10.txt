and possibly closer to the Dickens story line. Although I find the young Ebenezer hard to watch (the idea was that period hair, surely they could have done better than that!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. His delivery of some of Dickens's lines finally brought it to life for me. Edward Woodward is all we hope for and more of the gift of the Ghost of Christmas. I think G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more than a miserable believer than the most current version made by Patrick Stewart. The Christmas Morning scene, when Scrooge realizes he has not "lost", is enough to convince one of them that Scott knows how to act against the overact. He's phenomenal here. Almost the whole cast is incredible. Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little hard to see, almost too sweet. Still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday. Appreciate!
