I've watched this movie well over 100-200 times, and I love it every time I watched it. Yes, it can be very tacky, but it is also very fun and fun. The camp shown in the movie is a real camp that I actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as the camp really is, a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who went to camp, wanted to go to the camp or sent a child to camp, should see this movie, because it will bring back wonderful memories for you and your children.
