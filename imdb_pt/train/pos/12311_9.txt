"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most incredible Hong Kong movies I have ever seen. It's a brilliant blend of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has wonderful visuals and incredible fights. I especially love the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue. Truly unique and refreshing film and another good recommendation from the Embalmer.
