I really do not like the two Shrek movies. (Since your "PG" and has words in them I would never tell myself, so I did not like them.) But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", which I misunderstand I watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, in addition to Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of your ear. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance and departs toward it. This action eventually leads to its capture and various other things. Throughout the film we hear a narration. It is through the thoughts of the Spirit, though the horses never speak. This is what makes the movie so goo. They (the filmmakers) recorded real horses to make the sounds the horses made; None of these sounds were made by humans. <br /> <br /> The spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a Native American, owner of Rain. Little Creek later releases Spirit and Rain, they rush home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I plan to buy the soundtrack for this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
