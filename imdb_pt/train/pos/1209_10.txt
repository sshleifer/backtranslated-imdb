In a time of such horrible cartoons, I'm a bit in shock watching a movie with such good morale get to the IMDB Bottom List for animated movies. <br /> <br /> This movie contradicts the first. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age range for this movie, I did not even realize it, nor would it have mattered if I did. The people who did this may have used the "New Generation" to note that this is another way in which the Bear Caring Family could have started. Maybe we should decide for ourselves how the Loving Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie at age three and six, and it did not scare me or confuse me. <Br/> <br />
