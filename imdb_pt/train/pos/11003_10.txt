Listen, I do not care what anyone says, since the Cypher is no less than a 5-star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, a film B. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say that I am a connoisseur of the best spy films in the world and this movie is nothing short of a top flight. I can not emphasize how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and made. The technology in this film is on the space-time horizon. In fact, I must admit that Cypher completely surprised the hell out of me. In fact, I recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Other critics, some of whom underestimated the film, have no idea what the hell they're talking about. Do not listen to the enemies. And in fact, for the most part, Cypher's reviews have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not just a good movie, but it's also a fantastic movie. Cypher is the kind of film that is so advanced and so magnificently crafted that it is above the heads of most critics and all cynics. There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever. Once again, the cinematography, the scenarios, the technology, the plot and the acting are 100% first class. Of course, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And while it is the claim of some critics that Cypher should have been in theaters, I quite believe the contrary. Cypher is a movie that seems to have been perfect just for the DVD release and not in a bad way. Cypher has to be the biggest underground spy movie coming to the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... beware! Cypher also earns the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research Hall of Fame of the 5 Star Eternal Spiritual Cinema. Cypher is counter-espionage, it's absolutely better. Hands down and no hat. Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.
