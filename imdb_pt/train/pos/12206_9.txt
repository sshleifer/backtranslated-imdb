Of all the noirs movies of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to be ranked as one of the strangest and most entertaining to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but it was the last two that made this movie so much fun for me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the strangest people I've ever seen in the movies. His voice and some of the things he said need to be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with short blond hair, but it's still Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you're a guy. Welles is as fascinating as ever. One tip: If you have the DVD, enable the English subtitles. Your character in this film is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the film, which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial close-ups. You also have a unique end, visually, with a gunfight in a house of mirrors. Good stuff! As bizarre as this movie is, I still thought that the carnival atmosphere at the near-final judgment was too much and took the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
