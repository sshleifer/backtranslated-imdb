I remember seeing this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I really did not understand the mood back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this movie. His performance is surprising - given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. Its mannerisms are first-rate. ("You know what kind of music he wrote? Sh * t!" And speaking to the Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: "No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> Many compliments to Richard Benjamin, who played the direct man with Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just wanted it to be on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a little old. <br /> <br /> No interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original.
