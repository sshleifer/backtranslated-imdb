Great drama with all areas covered EXCEPT for screenlay which was very slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like Pitt's character interviewing the President, or Pitt being murdered rather than just having described to us. Scenarios like these would have kept the audience awake Cutting a few useless minutes could have given more room for more painful scenes like these. The drag of the movie kept this of all time greats, although seeing Pitt here makes the movie worth watching. Also, great fans of fising, early 20th century styles and Montana will really enjoy this too ..... ...
