This movie is visually stunning. Who cares whether she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. The locations, scenery and costumes work perfectly to convey what is found in a love story composed of beauty, youth and wealth. In a way, I would like to see this film as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as father, mentor, lover, and his portrait of a man, of men, lost to a bygone age when men were men. There are some of us who find value in strength and direction involved in a trust that contributes to a sense of trust, restraint, and security. Yes, they do not make men like that anymore! But how often do you find women who are made like Bo Derek?
