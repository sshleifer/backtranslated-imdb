Okay, I'll admit - I'm crazy and occasionally I love a really silly comedy. Although I've seen more Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut movies than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a crush on a stupid comedy that does not try to be sophisticated, but it's just funny. Some of these movies that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, BEGIN THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW, and the Bill and Ted movies. They all have no snob appeal, but only a zombie or a professional movie critic may not like them. <br /> <br /> Although BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as Bill & Ted's original movie, it's still a lot of fun. In addition, unlike the original, it seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember not loving the movie the first time I saw it - possibly because the other film set such a high standard for laughter. But every time I see him again, I'm impressed by all the great moments - particularly those involving the Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this grim reaper is as different from Bergman's in SEPARATE SEAL as you can get !! In addition to lots of laughs, this movie features great music - a way that is actually better than the first movie. The Kiss anthem at the end is great, but so are the rest of the hard rock songs - as long as you're not an old-fashioned spoiler like De Nomolos. Great viewing for children and adults.
