The alternative title of Ecstasy is the Symphony of Love; a title that adequately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is one of the first talkies, and it could very well have been a classic movie if released during the silent movie era. This film is a visual delight, and is deliberately stimulated so that the viewer can savor his sensual lyrical quality, which is presented in a discreet artistic way. The director's style is distinctly European. The subject and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was being produced in Hollywood at that time. Consider the US censorship code during the 1930s that pretty much sums it up. Hedy Lamarr, one of the greatest beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love".
