I've watched this movie three times. The last time, I kept hopping around confusing scenes to find resolution to the plot. Perhaps the plot does not intend to unite logically. Or maybe these difficult points are in the plot, because Ann's remembrance of distant events is quite flawed. <br /> <br /> See the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who attended an unnamed college with the descendants of a wealthy family. She must have had help paying for this expensive education, but she never seems to have any family ties. She never seems to have relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect. <br /> Ann shares a night of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). So when Harris comforts Lila after her brother Buddy's tragic death, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and disgusted with his own behavior. I must have missed something significant here. Ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and ends up marrying one of the godparents at Lila's wedding. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she continues to nurture deep feelings for him on his deathbed. It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply in love with Ann and would have happily married her. A scene showing her chance to meet years after Lila's marriage showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film set a standard for Ann's romantic relationships. She always had a fight with her men and she rejected them. This pattern was maintained with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man she did not love and remained with her husband until his death. Maybe Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let the marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the very convenient reappearance of Lila Ross at Ann's head. Apparently, Ann's nurse managed to extract enough information from Ann's last lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of these communications appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> I wondered about the house where Ann was living during her last days. How did she afford to buy such a house with the meager earnings of her singing career? Ann always seemed one step ahead of the financial disaster while raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoyed the music and scenery of the movie immensely. The seaside mansion was so painfully beautiful. Claire Danes was as luminous as the young Ann Grant. She really is a very talented singer. I much prefer her natural brunette to the blonde look of the bottle she had in the extras of the movie. If only those CGI fireflies would go away, I could raise the movie a whole point in my vote!
