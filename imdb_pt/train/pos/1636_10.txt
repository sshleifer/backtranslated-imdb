This is one of the greatest films of the 80's !!! It stands out as a "crap in a punch" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine has denounced it or anything. And yet, they proudly put their name on a show with "Stuart", "I speak-a-no-enlish Chinese lady" and "face UPS on speed." What is up with that? And I love Ron Leibman - he's shaved !! I wonder why he got his name removed from the credits? It was the funniest paper I know. Of course, he's not as dumb as Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this movie is up there with the National Lampoon vacation. If you liked movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any of the other 1980s teen movies, you'll love this one !! Rent and you'll see what I mean !!
