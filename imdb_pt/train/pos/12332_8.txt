Having seen the short number of times in horror movie marathons, I believe it is a humorous parody that cuts the main point of your reference. <br /> <br /> Although the themes are crisp and rancid to today's viewers, it is by no means a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although being a student film gives little chance to an excuse, the proof is that it seems to be carefully worked out on a budget of little or no mass. As noted by another reviewer, it is less than ten minutes, which is plenty of time to clear the vision palate with a toast of joy, sit and loaf through the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this short-bread of a movie should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it.
