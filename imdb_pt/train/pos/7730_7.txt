If in the 90's you're adapting a book written in the 50's, define the bloody thing in the 50's and not in the 90's. See, the customs and values ​​of 40 years tend not to play as well, or play as truth, so far on the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood usually continues to violate. And that's the problem with this movie. It should have been defined in the era in which it was written. You'd think it would be a no-brainer, but no. I would elaborate, but bmacv's comment spells very well. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. She seems to have made her butt completely out of existence for this role. As a result, she looks like a fuck in chemo, and is as sexy as a gay leather couch in the drag. I found her "I could die at any time" look quite disconcerting, and this greatly undermined her supposed "hotness" and "sexual tension" that the film intended to create. Other than that, the movie was very good; a 7+ out of 10.
