Interesting how much Brosnan's performance is more realistic than the original James Bond novels when compared to the bonus movies. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and womanish. This is perfect for him, even to make fun of the link icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. There is nothing better than that. I just read Dr. No and that's a lot like Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fit the icon nicely. There was nothing for him to customize the character, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan play a character based on reality and exuberantly on the wall. A superficial character trying to come to an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological issues with which he has no knowledge. It's an impressive portrait, and having Greg Kinear on the floor, is just poetic. This movie reminds me a bit of the dynamic established between the main characters in "My Blue Heaven" but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.
