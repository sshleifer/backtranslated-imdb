Starlift is a nice and interesting turn for the music photos of all the stars that all the studios were launching during the years of World War II. When you have stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, etc. in the film and with people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, they provide the music is easy to film. And the plot is not even in the way. <br /> <br /> What storyline involves two Air Force men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to find Warner Brothers star Janice Rule using the trick as a trick. who both come from Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist, as well as half of the city. The layout works great because Louella Parsons soon puts them as an item in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She must have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner more than the other studio bosses, because she also used this studio to promote her Hollywood Hotel radio show back then. But the rest of the plot also mentioned the real-life efforts of Ruth Roman, who also performed to get her studio and other people to perform at the Air Force bases for military men and women going to to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform at a show at Travis Air Force Base, where much of that movie was shot. <br /> <br /> A special number was filmed by the talents of Phil Harris, who sing / narrates a ballad Look Out Stranger, I am a Texas Ranger aided and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he was having a great time playing with his image. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest of the cliches when you say they do not make them anymore like that but they really do not because you do not have a studio system that has all that talent under contract. That's one thing about the end of the old studio system that we may regret.
