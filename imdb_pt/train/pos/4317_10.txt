I really enjoyed this movie when it was released, and I still do, because the plot makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people too ... one of the things I like about the Lawrence Kasdan films. In addition to the positive vibes of the movie, there are other reasons to enjoy the Grand Canyon. On the one hand, it has an excellent cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture, was very similar to this movie. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose the Grand Canyon over the Crash any day.
