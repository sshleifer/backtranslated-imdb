I was deeply moved by this movie in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious thing! A beautiful little girl. His performance was also excellent. Faithful to life and very human. Although I do not like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was just a false prop. Either way, she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so touching. I found myself immersed in the story and its character. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting how I discovered this movie actually. I was walking in blockbuster and I just happened to notice his handsome smile on the cover while I was passing by. Luckily, I looked down in the direction this movie was! I thought to myself, 'Astonished, look at her!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as wonderful things like "A Little Gem". I read the plot in the back and then thought, well, maybe I'd look up at the IMDb first and then come back to rent it later. I'm glad I did not do it, because I would surely be missing out. After looking for a movie with my friend, I knew that I would end up regretting not having fixed this movie, so I went back to where I originally found it and opened it. <br /> <br /> I stayed in my dressing table for a week, since school started for me this week and I did not really have time to watch, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. I put it on and stuck in the beautiful cinematography, delightful track and thrilling plot from start to finish. I was so captivated and I must say, some parts almost brought me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to make a special mention for the young man in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was outstanding. Also the actor who played Carol's father, whose name unfortunately is not listed on the site. His voice was so loving and gentle that I could really feel his love for Carol. Even though his appearance is not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is really a wonderful movie. If you are a person who is moved by light but by emotional films, then this is definitely one for you.
