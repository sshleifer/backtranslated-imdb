I just saw this finely crafted and beautifully designed film. It was nip and tuck to know if I was going to waste my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the horribly distracting ads. Reading the previous reviews persuaded me to give it a try. After all the worst that could happen would be that I could sleep during one of the boring but annoying bugs spray ads. So, why did I watch? mainly because when IMDB gives a film a "WEIGHTED AVERAGE" of 5.8, the WHO statistical mean was 7.3. It must be a sure hit. <br /> <br /> I was totally happy to have had time to see this movie, chicken pox and everything. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on enduring roles, adapting her central personality to fit each role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this tough but perceptively human cop was beautifully executed. When the scene calls for quick and insightful verbal intercourse, it can come face-to-face with any actor. However, she is adept at delivering emotional response volumes without uttering a word that depends only on facial expression and body language. Without the commercials, which, by design, kill the continuity of any good film, that would have been a real obstacle to the nails. I gave a 9.0
