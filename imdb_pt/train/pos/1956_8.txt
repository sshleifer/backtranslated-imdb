Actually, I think this movie is more of an easy target than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is done very well in many ways and is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit complicated, but that's the genre. The film has a noiric atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like all old classics noir, this also has a script that distorts you so you do not always know how to understand at first, and can be a stretch if you think deeply and try to put all the pieces together. This is the genre. In general, the script has enough surprises and twists to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks great and talks double-entender about the dialogue loaded in such a way that it turns into something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than acceptable, because let's face the truth. Do you have to keep an audience interested in "did she or did not?" He asks for two hours. In addition to a winding script and a fun performance of Stone, this is done effectively through the direction, by creating a noirquesa atmosphere that is at the same time dark and very glittering and modern, with straight industrial lines to accompany those of Stone. sensual curves. The picture is always beautiful - press the pause anywhere and there is something interesting in the eyes. <br /> <br /> The film also actually builds things that were tricks in the first movie and turns them into something a little more real. particularly sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" becomes more natural here, and, typically, the sexuality of the film is used for better effect. It is still stimulating, but not as readily for the value of shock and tinnitus as done in the first. I will not say it is not a trick yet, because let's face it, this movie is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And a fun movie is. It can be an easy target, but if you notice what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-not-she-who-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy (no pun intended)
