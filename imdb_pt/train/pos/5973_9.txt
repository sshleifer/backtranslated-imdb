This is a great and ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the obsession of the 80s until the late 80s, with what was supposedly the evil metal music. I remember being scared of metal teenagers when I was a kid. It does not help that I found a grave desecrated in the cemetery of my hometown when I was ten years old. It turns out that this strange metal boy unearthed some old bodies and used his bones in some strange sacrifice for satan. So maybe things like they dissuade me from the metal for a while, but I love it now, at the age of 24. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD used for $ 6 and I expected it to be sucked due to the thigh cover. , but to my surprise, he decided. It's all about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you have to love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers into the crowd. This movie is amazing, if you like bad and 80's metal movies, this one is for you. 9/10!
