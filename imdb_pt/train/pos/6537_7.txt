The children I took to this movie loved it (four kids, ages 9 to 12, they would have given it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was lovely in the lead role. (Expect to see more Roberts next generation in the future.) After being exposed to names like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was great to see a girl who did not seem to have worked with her. streets. He also liked to see a supporting cast that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with a special guest of Bruce Willis). Final takeaway: Cute movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I did not read the book series, so my comments are based solely on the merit of the movie).
