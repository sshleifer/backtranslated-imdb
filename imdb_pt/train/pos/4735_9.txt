I saw the new version redubbed and edited yesterday and loved it. So I went home and watched with subtitles and I loved it. I'm ready to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for the gentle secret identity and what could be more polite than a pacifist librarian? The scenes in which he reveals his superpowers to his friends or absentmindedly forgets to be meek are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course the martial arts are impressive. There is not much to say about them if you are familiar with the HK style. However, if you're not ... we stopped playback briefly and Walker, Texas Ranger was on. We noticed that after each attack there was a cut. Not in the Black Mask. <br /> <br />
