A powerful adaptation of the bestselling book and Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colorful" sisters who lived more than 100 years. Wonderfully touched in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively. They tell their story in flashbacks by Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white reporter for the New York Times. The flashback and the current scenes are not as inspiring as the book, but they are really powerful. However, certain aspects of sisters' lives, such as the interracial origin of their mother and the reasons behind her father's severe personality, are not presented clearly. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. Which is good, because the book is so good! In addition to these flaws, it is wonderfully made and executed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
