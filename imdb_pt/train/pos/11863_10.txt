Perhaps this may be the best film of all time and, if it is not, it is certainly one of those burned by his students, since what Brian De Palma offers here is an excellent work of film art. First, there is the touch of Brian De Palma's director who proves once again that he may be one of the best directors of all time, there is the excellent performance of Al Pacino, who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana ), there are the many different (violent) scenes you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in which Tony is sitting in a bathtub that is as big as most people's living room), there are many superb one liners (count how often the word "f * ck" is used), there are the small, superb details (the pan-American globe that shouts "The world is yours") or the great disconcerting of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named that is not sublime here and is easily along with "The Godfather", "Good guys" and "White heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever made!
