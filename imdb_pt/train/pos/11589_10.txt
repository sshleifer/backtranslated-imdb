Dude, I loved this movie! It really takes me back when I was a kid. These were the days when teachers were still showing real-life classroom movies and if you were good, they rewound the movie slowly so you could watch it go back. I still remember one of the opening lines ... "Tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan. He lived with his sister in the village." This is a great movie for children and as long lasting as the red balloon. In the end, the other Indian boys in the village tie the feathers to Tutazema and he himself becomes an eagle. He can live the way he always wanted to. He can climb the skies.
