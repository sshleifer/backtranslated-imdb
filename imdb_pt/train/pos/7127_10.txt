Wonderful movie again dealing with the trials and tribulations of the 11th World War in England. What makes this movie so good is the touch of the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of classics of the British line as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As is the case with this film, we see the despair of people at the time of the war. <br /> <br /> Presentations are excellent here, especially by the bitter John Thaw, who is assigned a child who was evacuated from the bombing in London. <br /> <br /> Soon we see why this child wets his bed. It comes from a lunatic mother who abused him terribly. <br /> <br /> The old man takes the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child is returned to the mother, the old man goes to London and seeks only to discover a tragedy. He literally kidnaps the kid and is able to convince taller that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's house. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it deals with and builds loving relationships.
