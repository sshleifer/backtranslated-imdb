I went to see this movie with a lot of friends one night. I really did not hear much about it. So I was not expecting anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that the acting performance of Giovanni Ribisi needed a bit of excitement. But such a small flaw could be nullified. Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who must drive 60 exotic and rare cars in a night to save the life of his brother. The film is not predictable. So the ending should be a surprise. Do you think it's just another fast-driving movie? Well, you're partially right. There is much more than that. Everyone should take a look at this movie.
