The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and all of the chemistry comes along, along with the minimalist approach to the narrative and direction of Govind Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also great. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie like this. It's a whole, every piece so well embedded in the plot. You can not be impressed with this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes out as the bossy husband and 'baap' of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man trapped between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives the right touch to the film with its smiling, soft-spoken villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty in place of Sadhashiv is absurdly impressive. Smita Patil does not play a major role, but his part also does not distract the main plot. <br /> <br /> And to add to all this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a police officer who came to terms with the system and its operation. Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to stay out of trouble. He is also the 'guru' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only brings to light the difficulties faced by one policeman trying to do his duty, but also the other. brutality in police custody. Om Puri captures the hopelessness and ardent desire to break free from this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A pleasure for all eager fans of Indian cinema.
