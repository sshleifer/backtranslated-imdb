Glacier Fox is one of the most moving and wonderfully photographed wildlife films of all time. <br /> <br /> The movie makes you worry about every member of this family of foxes, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures sometimes hilarious and also tragic. Set against an inhospitable backdrop, the heart of the public is warm to family members. <br /> <br /> The score and the lyrics tell the story interspersed with the narration about what is happening in general terms. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the greatest predators, but we have no doubt that foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavor.
