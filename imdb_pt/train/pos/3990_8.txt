May and her husband will visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is strange because the grandchildren and "kids" do not really seem to get to know each other as one would expect. The heat that should be there is missing. After dinner, May's husband says he does not feel well, blames his daughter's food and, irritably, says he wants to go home. He dies that night. <br /> <br /> May, now a widow, is lost. She clearly did not have a passionate or very interesting marriage, but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and though her own needs had not been met for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She's depressed and unmotivated. She will stay with her daughter, Paula, who soon after her mother arrives, lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother gave much of herself. She lets go of her mother's lack of affection. May seems unarmed and surprised, but she also does not seem to have the energy or desire to actually do the right things. "I'm your mother and I love you." What does it really say? (I've heard it from my own mother many times and still have not figured out what it means.) Paula is a little (well, more than a little) neurotic. Both women are needy, although they show very differently. <br /> <br /> Paula was involved with a friend of her son, Darren, who works at his son's house. While Paula works during the day, May starts talking and having lunch with Darren. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of his autistic son, Nicky, but supposedly does not live at home with his wife. May becomes attracted to Darren because he is virile and she likes the connection that they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because it offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not receive from the other women in his life. (He also becomes very interested in money that May says she can give him to "get away from it all," although he clearly is not interested in his desire to join him on such a journey. They end up sleeping together in the bedroom During the day, May enjoys satisfaction as a woman she has not known for years, nor ever expected to know again. As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave the couple Darren, this becomes part of May's rationalization. what she's doing is fine. <br /> <br /> In a group of writers Paula leads, May is introduced, somewhat forced to reunite with a widower whom she is not attracted to. There is a scene in which she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform, and it's really painful and disturbing when we see the total disgust in May's face as she supports the hideous bond of time. Eventually, Paula discovers through some very graphic sketches s made by his mother, that in fact his mother and Darren were having sex. <br /> <br /> This movie will undoubtedly be seen by many in countless ways. The sympathies will be divided. At one point, during Paula's writing group, May reveals through a short essay that she used to feel like she hated her kids by the end of the day, and left for pubs after they were asleep, making sure to go back to House Before Clearly, a good mother does not think about leaving the children alone while she goes to the local pub. May, however, had also previously revealed in the film that her husband did not like having friends, so she had none. She did what he wanted her to do. She was unhappy, but she bore because, as she said, "it was easier." So although May was not the best mother, for those who have some sympathy for her, one can see May's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and living for "a few minutes" in her life. . A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, to know her as a human being, to have a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, though neurotic and unhappy, may have become so because of the distant parents who created her. Of course, it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made movie with more complexities than I mentioned, and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps conflicting, reactions. It's a movie that is worth discussing and debating, and above all, worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing the movie leaves us is the horror and fear of a lonely life. No matter who is considered "right" or considered "wrong" by every viewer, this theme of old age and loneliness, evoking a sense of fear in most of us, is inescapable.
