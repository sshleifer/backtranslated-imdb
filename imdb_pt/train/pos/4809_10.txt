With all the recent films dealing with the British monarchy, is it really time for another? Answer: YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the British film flurry dealing with the royal family. In this case, it deals with the early life of Princess Victoria, and the events that led to her coronation becoming Queen of all England, as well as her romance and eventual marriage to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the stormy lives and careers of both Queen & Prince of England as well as various other events that take place (political turmoil, etc). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast comes complete with names like Miranda Richardson, like the Dutch from Kent, and always welcome onscreen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of others that glow on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), directs an award-winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely lost my head with the visual appearance of the film (by the director of photography Hagen Bogdansker), who gave each film frame a visual pictorial (with the help of the production designer, Patrice Vermette) as well as a strict edit Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner). What I also enjoyed in Fellowes' script is the use of a game of Chess as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivations (the characters of the film move like the pieces of a chessboard). This is intelligent, well-written, directed, filmed, edited and acted entertainment (and lighting) that contributes to a well spent night in the movies. Rated PG by the MPAA for some scenes of sensuality, some brief violence (a bit bloody, though not much bloody), a rude blast of language, and some smoking on the screen
