I'm giving just 9 out of 10 because I need to see it again in a more current mindset to take a new perspective. What I remember is an incredible psychological thriller that blew my brain and my eyes when I watched. I watched it every time I showed up on HBO earlier in the day (probably in 1990). I may have even recorded it, but this recording is long gone, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get that title, they currently do not carry it. I hope to meet you at a local video store. <br /> <br /> I recommend you try it out somewhere. It's interesting in the least. If you liked movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or anything strange and in that sense, try this one.
