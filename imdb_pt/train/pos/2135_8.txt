We Must Dance is a great movie because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Dance is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of individuality. This is certainly the case with Aoki. At work he is a humble clerk, but puts him on the dance floor and all his bottled intensity is released. Surprisingly, this launch is frowned upon in Japan due to the rigid culture of compliance. At the beginning of the movie, all characters are ashamed or afraid of the desire to dance. They will be despised, or considered perverted, for expressing their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching this movie to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.
