Homeward Bound: A Incredible Journey is an important movie of my life because it is the first movie I remember seeing in my hometown cinema as a 4 year old boxer. The story is based on the novel by Sheila Burnford and is one of the reasons why it is not possible to write it as a brainless clone of Lassie. <br /> <br /> The basic story: two dogs and a cat live happily The Seaver family, when the new husband of the mother of three children, gets a job in the city and they have to move temporarily to the interior of San Francisco, while the animals are sent to a farm to live for a few months. The ties between the animals and the children they attend are especially strong, and Shadow, the Golden Retriever, and Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat, are heartbroken as children, although the young and cheerful American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less worried and a little cynical (due in part to his voice explaining that he was abandoned as a puppy, took an animal shelter and was bought by the family), although his growth as a character throughout history provides much of the An important story. <br /> <br /> The three pets escape from the ranch and depart for the vast and dangerous wilderness (fantastic scenery in nature, by the way), driven by Shadow's instincts of direction. They encounter various hazards along the way, hoping to get home, while the family and farm hosts are suddenly worried about the disappearance of animals. There are funny moments all along the way, a great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a moving comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the narrative, punctuated by moments of sadness (as when Sassy's arrogance in trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall into the river and fall into a waterfall, leaving a moment of loss that is deeply felt by the viewers. <br /> <br /> I can not see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow it seems a bit unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> The finale increases bets when the shadow falls into a hole in a trainyard and, after hurting the leg, finds it hard to leave and gives out exhausted, followed by Chance climbing with him to persuade him to leave , telling him how important he is to him and how he led them here so he would not throw everything so easily. <br /> <br /> The way this (brilliantly made) scene is not completed leaves an ambiguity that continues in the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be found. Then, just as everything seems lost, he appears slowly and reunites with his family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the camaraderie that developed between him and his companions on the journey, and the realization of which house really is of his long journey to get there, leaves a good epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also as the other two have too. Wait a second, I think I'm going to cry ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I did not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I do not pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a movie the whole family can watch, and while the little ones will love talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot better (as I found when I watched the movie again after several years without seeing it). This movie is a movie masterpiece, and I suggest that if you have not seen it, get out and get it! <br /> <br /> And, please avoid the sequel (see my Homeward Bound II review!)
