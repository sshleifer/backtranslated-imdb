This is a wonderful film ... The first impressions of cynicism and rudeness are soon dispelled by a fun demonstration of how the most basic motivations of men and women diverge (Vive la difference!) <br /> <br /> You can loving people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. Humans are a bit bullshit, but we have big hearts and we try our best, despite the temptation. It is not our fault when sometimes temptation can not be resisted, it is just who we are. <br /> <br /> There is a consistent style from beginning to end; crisp picture and crisp composition, very enjoyable viewing when you add provocative content, proper music and laughs loudly. <br /> <br /> Beware of the very young "wise and solitary voice" ... brilliant; wisdom of innocence balancing the comedy of the human condition.
