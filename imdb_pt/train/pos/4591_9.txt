It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan is gone. It used to be an uncontrollable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible acrobatics. To be fair, he's now in his fifties and you'd expect some slowdown. But with 'Rush Hour 3' where he sits in the backseat of Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there's 'Kung Fu Panda' where he's not just in a vocal role, but his character barely has any dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal euphemism. <br /> <br /> It's time to do this when the only solution is to tear off an old dusty VHS tape and see Jackie kick some asses in his youth. Chris Tucker's free days. <br /> <br /> Enter 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a police officer whose job it is to protect a witness before a major trial. He faces the resistance of both the non-cooperative witness and the countless killers sent by the crowd to silence them. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We did not watch Jackie Chan movies for the story. We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform dizzying stunts and usually punch and kick a lot of people who are less impressive than he is. <br /> <br /> And at that level, 'Police Story' does not disappoint at all. There is an incredible showdown in a mall at the end that culminates with Jackie coming down a gigantic high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if that sort of thing happened more often, no male would have to be persuaded to go buy clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also comedy, many of which involve Kar-kui inadvertently disturbing May (Maggie Cheung), his girlfriend eternally suffering and seemingly always forgiving. Humor in general is rather subtle, but it works, so I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The acting is not very subtle either. In fact, I'm not sure if there was anything subtle about the 'Police Story'. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that as we wait for the next fight to begin, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuances and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So, 'Police Story' is a blast. As is the case with most of your films, the fact that Jackie actually does the things you see on screen puts your head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging on a bus at high speed by an umbrella, a whole new "Wow!" factor is added to the action.
