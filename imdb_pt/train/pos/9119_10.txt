An interesting way to see how we humans often behave is sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection, which sometimes destroys the basis of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the question of how we tend to ignore those among us who are not sincere and in doing so may miss a great opportunity. The comedy injection also makes watching the movie a pleasant experience. It is necessary to see for those who are interested in a reflective and comical look of life. I look forward to your next product. I hope you continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Great job ...... Joanne
