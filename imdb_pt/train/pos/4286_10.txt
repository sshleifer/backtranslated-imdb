I saw this movie (the title in English is "Who's Singing Over There?") At the Montreal International Film Festival in 1980. It won praise then ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I've seen only a few comedies (or any other genre) that match its originality.
