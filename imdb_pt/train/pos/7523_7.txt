I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it's a movie and not a movie since it was apparently filmed by HBO to be shown on its cable network sometime this year. This movie features Page as a fetish and disciplining fetish pinup and B & D stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a bit more than that and the film touches on some of its other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the 1950s pinup icon. This movie is supposedly based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. It's filmed in black and white for that nostalgic feel of the 50's. I have the book called "Bettie Page The Life of a Pin-up Legend" which has many great photos narrating the career of Page and I must say that this film reproduces in the film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these famous photos accurately. Mol herself with Bettie Page's black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. She not only has the look of Bettie Page, but also has the smile and personality traits that came out of the camera perfectly. And her body is as close as possible to a replica of Page. Great cast. The story is kind of thin and tabloid and certainly could have been much better. But this is a good TV movie. I would rate a 7.0 out of a scale of 10 and would recommend that it be seen when it arrives on the TV.
