It is a joy to have witnessed this intriguing project. So refreshing and polite. Not just for a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as public, who may not be so prepared for so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 films about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought that the segment of Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best, although the mimes made me smile just the same. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" option for this review bus, unfortunately ... what you read is a sufficient spoiler. See you. Do not read what I write, but watch the movie. <br /> <br /> And smile.
