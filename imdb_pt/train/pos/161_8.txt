This silly movie is a lot of fun for the younger crowd. Their heroes are a pair of detectives whose noble attitudes lead them to very foolish ways. Pursuing the big murder case, you'll find that these detectives do their best to solve the crime. No nudity, but with a lot of sexual implications, nonsense ... everything teenagers like. Low budget but great fun. Classical potency of definite worship.
