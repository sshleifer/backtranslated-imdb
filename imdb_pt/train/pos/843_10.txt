Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when did it really go bad? I think this movie is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this movie is something very different in the world of today's movies, where all the other movies have the blue Payback filter. I also love the way they used the music from Asia. Proving that even what has once been thought of as tacky can be very cool placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I was doing my first feature when it came out. Since my film was a hit movie, I had to check out anything in the genre that was released. After seeing this, I'm sure it had some effect on me during the process. It was really cool when my movie joined IMDb that I would recommend this movie if you liked mine. As any of the others relates I have no idea, making an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
