You'd better watch this episode from the beginning, because if you start watching it later, you'll be confused about what's going on with Clark's life. <br /> <br /> However, this is the turnaround; Clark is trapped in an alternate reality. Lana is dedicated to him. Lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he deviated from missing Clark in the series pilot. Martha is married to Lionel. About the only constant is her most loyal friend Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, yes, it does not have any superpowers. He is in a mental institution to put himself in a fantasy world where he has powers and is ridiculed for believing it. In addition to Chloe, there is a mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who in reality alternative is also a resident of the institution, who believes that he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must remain faithful to everything he believes to be the current reality, and not be brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is in fact the fourth fugitive of the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is totally mind-boggling and shocking. In addition, it provides a new twist on the usual episode type of "Smallville".
