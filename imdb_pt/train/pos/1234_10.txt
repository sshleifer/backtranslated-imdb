I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it as much today as when I was a kid. Do not listen to the critical comments. They are not accurate in this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines on your roll. You can sit down with your whole family and everyone will like it. I recommend this movie for everyone to see. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a little bald boy with God as powers. This movie takes you from LA to Tibet, to the wonderful view of the wonderful temples of the mountains in Tibet. a beautiful view! So go do yourself a favor and snatch it! You will not regret!
