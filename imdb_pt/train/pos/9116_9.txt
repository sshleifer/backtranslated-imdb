The idea is a very clever title that the film has a serious language in the face. But it's so subtle that you can not read! Are these guys doing a complete comedy or is there something else going on? The small dialogue that the film has is not very delicate and this increases the power of the film. If all the sound were disconnected from the movie, it would not take anything from the movie. Physical actions or the art of showing are so strong that they carry the whole of the story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame. I first say this movie as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie I was so impressed with the work. But then I wondered what came next? Where can anyone see this work? The common association of art without purpose is not found here. You can see the intent in the design from the beginning to the end. The use of African music in the casting style all seems planned and for a reason. The development of the character is incredible. The cast I think is the strongest aspect of the film; the characters are easily set within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of the actual movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more such films, there really needs to be more support for the development of short films around the world. edge.
