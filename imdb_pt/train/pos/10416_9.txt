Like the Thousand and One Nights, this movie plays with storytelling conventions to make us feel that there is plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the painting device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then delves into a flashback that takes us to the present of the blind, where we find that about half of the story is yet to come. (It must be admitted that the second half does not match the promise of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights, she tries to cram as many Middle Eastern folk objects into the one work as possible. A liberated genius, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded market, an evil vizier, jewels ... I do not know why everything works, but it works. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he can convince us that he's being Hungarian in a Persian way.
