This was Eddie Robinson's 101st film and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after filming was completed. All this makes his key scene in the film even more moving. <br /> <br /> Although some of the hair styles and clothes are a bit old-fashioned (note also the video game shown in the film), but the theme of the film is almost timeless. Heston said he wanted to make the film for some time, because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The acting is of a high level, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with pleasant performances also of Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. . The mix of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky, combined with the pastoral visual elements, creates some really exciting scenes. This was the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or the "dot") of the movie is significant. Yes, it is a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note it is a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with man's administration on Earth. It is in the subtext that you find the real message of the movie. Pay attention to what the Sun says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present), and note how Thorn is unable to understand what the Sun is saying. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my top science fiction films of all time.
