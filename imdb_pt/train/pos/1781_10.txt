... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was stunned by this short film. I saw, randomly, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I have thanked God for it every day since then. I really, really believe I was part of an event, like reading a Tarantino script before anything else or seeing the first display of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what festival the short is going for or what the creative team has for future products, but I hope I can be there for that. <br /> <br /> Once again, a really incredible movie.
