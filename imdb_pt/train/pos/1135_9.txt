I saw this for the first time at the movies when it came out, and the crowd was really in the movie, which made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast of characters, many great names, some of whom were not as recognizable as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or if you love them in other movies, to add it to your guest list. Some of the scenes really remind me of the kind of well-made comedy like The Birdcage or even The Clue, a kind of spontaneous-looking comedy with some really professional delivery of these beloved actors. The film did a great job at giving you some, perhaps even very realistic, tips on the culture of a daytime soap.
