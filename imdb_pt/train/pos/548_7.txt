This movie was just as good as some of the other Westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This movie begins as a western mill run, but gets more complex as it goes on. It begins with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle and Stewart is charged with murder. He is found innocent, but cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to take something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares about getting her cattle back. As the movie continues, it's as if Stewart cares only for himself, as does his character in Naked Spur. It gets much better halfway after they arrive in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's best westerns.
