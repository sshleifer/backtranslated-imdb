the photograph was beautiful but I had difficulty understanding what was happening ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... the 2 goldfish - do they mean anything in Thai culture? there is not much plot, not much happens and just continues. no real beginning, no real means and no real end. quite unsatisfactory, in fact. It was difficult to get into the characters like you never felt you knew them ... it was hard to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real. The movement seemed chaotic and disjointed. I do not know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve. Maybe if I were Thai it would make more sense ...
