I remember this Swedish television show. I was only 7 years old and this scared me beyond belief. <br /> <br /> I would love to revisit this series and see if it was as excellent as remembering, although I suspect my taste and requirements have changed. Although this has been released before aliens and a myriad of other space thrillers I suspect it has its roots in horror films from the 1950s and the political climate of the 1970s: s. When I think about it, this was a real sci-fi movie trying to discuss scientific and political issues about who we are and who we are. The term sci-fi has since become bleak and has become the term for any movie that has spaceships in them.
