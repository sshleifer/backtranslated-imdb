Fortunately I saw this on a plane to Singapore recently (I thought I had missed this on the Cinefame filmfest). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) by 20 directors who show love in various pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is Alfonso Cuarn's Parc Monceau (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made in one continuous blow and features Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers '' Tuileries '' starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist on the subway was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in 'Place des Victoires' were haunting. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / drug addict in 'Quartier des Enfants Rouges' having portrayed anticipation and disgust in such a short time the time was simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in 'Quartier de la Madeleine' was rather surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in Wes Craven's 'Pre-Lachaise'. Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual, as the actress girlfriend of a handicapped French boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite the many representations of young love, a more mature execution of Gena Rowlands in the Latin Quarter was equally aww-inducing. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is directed and thoughtfully thought out. <br /> <br /> There are also several memorable quotes. One in particular is this of a betraying husband who ends up leaving his lover to stay with his dying wife in his last days: "By pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
