Aim for the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that has a classic written all over the place. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it's still my favorite anime. And although it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was his first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Mostly beginning as a parody of the 70's sports drama Aim For The Ace, Gunbuster takes Steam as a serious drama toward the end of episode 2 when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father who was killed in the first meeting of humanity with the race of insects that humanity is at war. It's because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a fighter pilot. But her lack of confidence proves disruptive and she hesitates. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, believes in her. And he made his personal mission to see that she manages to become a pilot because he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian. Combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko, who is killed in their first assortment together, and Kimiko Higuchi, childhood friend of Noriko. The involvement of Kimiko is also of interest, as when Noriko is in space, Kimiko stays behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the dilatory acts of time, Kimiko ages normally on Earth, while Noriko is about the same age as when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old, while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great anime series to watch if you're a giant robot fan. mecha and animation Gainax. If you like other Hideaki Anno shows, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's masterpieces, give this show a try. It will grow on you.
