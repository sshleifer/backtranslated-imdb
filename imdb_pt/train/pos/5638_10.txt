I really liked this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This movie is about following your dreams and never giving up, no matter what people may do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly realizes her dreams as well as Britney. <br /> <br /> There are moments in everyone's life when they judge them for what they are not who they are. Watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams, no matter what. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She'll never know how much that means to me. Bravo Britney. You're the greatest !!!
