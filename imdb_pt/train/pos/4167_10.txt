The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a very good movie. He has good casting, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is scary and it gives that diabolical cold! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns, frilly as a part on its neck, and acted very viscous! If you like horror movies and have not seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this rare movie, then do so because it's a good movie and I do not think you'll be disappointed!
