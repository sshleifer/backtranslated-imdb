This is a great movie from the lost era of reactionary drama made for television. My all-time favorite actor, Robert Culp deftly traces a trajectory through liberal justice and faith in the system, conservatism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis. Teenagers are a collection of pure evil stereotypes, and the final message of this movie makes Dragnet episodes seem comparable. But what really shines in it is the movie's great rhythm, building fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole California scene. The cars are very good as well, if I remember correctly. I give this movie a 10, and I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute of it. Remember, just because it's made for television does not mean it's not great art.
