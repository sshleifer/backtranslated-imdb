Johny To does one of his best style exercises here, making a strong movie with a good story of Yakuza. The election of the new Yakuza chief is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion violence is wise used in context, making a gang movie very strong. I particularly love the way he tells the story, moving all the roles within the Yakuza family, and causing us to see violence as the only way they have to solve their problems ... Talking about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of a slow, rhythmic and planned way of filming a movie. One of the Hong Kong movies of the year. It's like hellish affairs, but without the easy scenes of action-violence and the messy plot. Strongly recommended for all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, better to do in Spanish lol)
