I had heard of Eddie Izzard, but I had never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw that he was on HBO one night last summer, I put him in without knowing how my husband would react. Well, he surprised us. He's better than Robin Williams ever was. He has full control of the public; when he does the 'Englebert is dead - no, he is not,' routine, the public does not know what to think until the end. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Spanish Inquisition in Python is performed by the Church of England - "Cake or Death." priceless. My jaws were aching to laugh until the end of the show. We scoured the TV listings for months after that so we could see him again, and we were fortunate enough to record it the next time he showed up. If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and burn it, you will not be disappointed.
