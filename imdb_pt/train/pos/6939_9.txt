I was very impressed with this movie. I would have to rate it as one of the best Westerns of the Classical era. I say this: acting, mature dialogue, absurd story and excellent cinematography. Director Anthony Mann, who made many well-photographed noir films at the same time, also made some westerns like this. It has that same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam," (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon that he won fair-and-square in a contest. It is then stolen and passed from villain to villain. All these villains are interesting characters. Helping Stewart to interpret this interesting story are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer, and J. C. Flippen. They are all fun to watch. It was a bit difficult, however, to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can not have it all.
