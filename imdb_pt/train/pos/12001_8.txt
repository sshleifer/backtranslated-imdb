I do not know what movie some of these people watched, but they must have seen a different "Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration" than what I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was at the same time. well done and inspiring. I think it definitely worth watching. It is evident from the beginning that much care has been devoted to the production of this film. The background scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job portraying Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with good taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
