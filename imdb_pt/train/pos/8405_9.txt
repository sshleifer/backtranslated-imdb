I am proud to say that I own an uncut copy of this piece of choice from the sexploitation comedy drive-in Crown International from the '70s on DVD. It's a really silly movie and pleasantly inconsequential with a very gay and cheerful vibe from the 70's. It tries to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail. Of course, it is essentially a striking teenage male fantasy photo - the main character teen goofus Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, respect from his friends and a chance to show up as a local van-racing bully - but he is very dopey and well- grumpy to hate. Stuart Getz, as our clumsy protagonist, makes a very idiotic connection, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's affection is a definite cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is also very hot like a beautiful blonde girl, and Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (a motorcyclist of 60's) perennial film) is wonderfully hateful as the brutal Dugan Hicks. One star, Danny DeVito in particular, is an absolute riot as the head of Getz's car wash owner Andy, a lovable, homely goofy man who wears ugly Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit. I particularly love the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny - one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works on Danny's torso! And the theme song from the insidiously catchy Sammy Johns hiccup hit will be bouncing around his skull for at least a week. In short, it's groovy retro-70 fun!
