It was usually a good movie with an ideal ending; the performance was spectacular and the characters did not move away from their people. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what would happen, it still gave the element of surprise throughout the movie. However, I think coming to the end could have been a bit longer (extended maybe) - to me, it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to get his clothes off the lines before the rain fell. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? As far as we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who set the whole thing up? Who knows! Maybe there's a sequel? Perhaps? If there is ... I can not wait to see this.
