David Aames is a rich and handsome guy who lives in New York. When her 'sleeping partner' Julie Gianni gets very jealous after David falls for the Spanish beauty Sofia, she puts David in his car and tells him that he is the only guy she loves and wants to be but seeing that he is in love by Sofia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, leaving a bridge. David survives the accident, but his face is disfigured. He is then charged with the murder of Julie. The point is that David does not know what is real and what is not, as he continues to have these strange dreams (most of them, indeed, nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which simply do not make sense to him. Everything will soon return to him as he begins to discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there is a star of stars, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who all perform well in the film. In the movie they all put different things about the characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. very well. There is also a special participation in the movie of the brilliant, Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well made, different, interesting and original movie that will leave you talking about it a lot after it's over. It's not just a suspense, but it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the movie is very good, but the film is very different from what you can imagine. It has been very well run and there have also been some really great scenes. All in all, a nice movie that should really be watched as well. They are doing a lot of movies "They are dead, if not dead" recently.
