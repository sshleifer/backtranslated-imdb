This is a movie that has many things that only the Japanese can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that he tried to send a message of some kind, but it ended up being wasted on me. <br /> <br /> What I felt is basically that this is a mediocre movie with good special effects. Some child becomes "That" and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense at all. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between Azumi beans wash yokai and the one that looks like a big tongue umbrella (Rihanna eat your heart!) I really could not discern the plot. Bottom line: nice visuals, the boy screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest sucks.
