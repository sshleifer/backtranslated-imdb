I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed performances where the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with the change between the ages. I also appreciated the underlying history of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer approaching a small town. I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without the man being handsome. Depth of character may be appealing to the not so shallow. The film looks good and cinematography is good too.
