This is an incredible 1936 movie. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the elegant vision of the year 2036 that comes later makes up for it. However, do not plan to be able to understand the whole dialogue - sound quality and accents (it's American - but "1930s Americans") make this difficult. <br/> <br/> Basically, the story is overwhelming. 100-year-olds look at a fictional US town called "Everytown." It ranges from 1936, when the war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology advances and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a little slow - although it is difficult to tell which audiences at that time would have thought. The events, suspense and visuals are rather understated in today's terms. However, when it comes to the future, it is simply fun to watch. The big sets and the sci-fi retro look of it all are hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have great listening skills, this movie is hard to hear. I think I understood only 80% of the dialogue. You could use captions. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of science fiction, this is one of the classics of the genre and it is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until there is a hidden captioned version and then watch it if you feel comfortable with movies from that period.
