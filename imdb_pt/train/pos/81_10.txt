I attended the McCoys meeting and was happy to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now was wonderful because I always watched the show growing so when the TV said it was going to be a meeting I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site, so if there is anyone out there who can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke I would be grateful !! all the places and no luck.The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is that he should have been born in 1946. This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned.The whole cast was amazing, the only thing better than finding out that they would find them So, since that's impossible, if there's anyone who can help please, do it!
