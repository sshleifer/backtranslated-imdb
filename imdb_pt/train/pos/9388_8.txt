For the presumed readers of Happiness, Cage and Hopper have met and fortunately not in a Lynch movie, because RED ROCK WEST is way better than any Lynch movie. Nicolas Cage is a third rate actor, the Porcelain Baby is a fatal femme surrogate, only Daddy Hopper is as bad as ever ??. RED ROCK WEST is, despite the banal cast, one of my favorite American thrillers; in a word, a thriller with some twists. <br /> <br /> We mostly notice the enthusiasm, incredible rhythm, thrills, good suspense, beautiful, tight tail of Lara Flynn Boyle, Cage's enviable physical form (albeit undeniably ugly, with sharp bird features , thick eyebrows and thin, rare hair, Cage had a thin general shape), Hopper's consummate routine, some moderate but truly funny moments, Cage's play with his persona, Hopper's rigid and psychotic fascination. Lara, Cage looks like a vagabond, the archetypal dark tramp of cinema noir, hungry, resilient if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle presents herself as the cold seducer, Walsh as her heartless husband, and Hopper as Lynch's lynx man he's done before. <br /> <br /> Cage really seems a bit groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover. But this can be your regular look.
