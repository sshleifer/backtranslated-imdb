Oh my, from the description of the box I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most, after directing this, would have fled a cliff or at least committed a mass murder. I confess I only watch the first half hour (for now). Reading all the reviews here, I have plenty to look forward to. Professional critics often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but that is graced with humor and fantasy and this is relentless in its severe realism. What did the Marshall Plan and the EU do? Seeing this in a theater with someone I know would only have resulted in a forced start after much less minutes than I got on DVD. There is a more boring creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker of Hell. Whatever happens to her is not enough! Soulless suburbs that I thought existed only in Arizona and Florida thrive in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and here they are in suburban malls? It was Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said, when asked about Western Civilization, "why could this be such a good idea"? If the world were really like this movie, bring that black hole, we're ready.
