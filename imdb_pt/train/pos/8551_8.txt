Ti% s and As *, many breasts. Some great characters, fun jokes and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise. This really looks like an old school. It looks a bit like Porkys in the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with some humorous situations make this a real surprise to me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast is practically finished except for one, this movie I found very entertaining. Stop being too excited, you have to take him to the teen comedy that he is, but for what it is, it's great. The characters are nice and funny, the girls are hotter than hell. The fun and games are hilarious, with some things I've never seen before in comedies, they make me shake but laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> So, ignore the enemies and make it work and see what you think. Do not expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and ignite your attention for an hour or more.
