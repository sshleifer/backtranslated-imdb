In Mexico City, the former CIA assassinated and currently a decadent alcoholic John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be the guard - faces of his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill each one responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece, and it will surely become a masterpiece. a classic in the future. The story is great, never tacky and, despite being 146 minutes long, the viewer does not feel the passage of time. The cast consists of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, standing out Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has wonderful moments and the script has impressive lines. I personally loved when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, movie of the year in this genre. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Flames of Revenge" ("Flames of Revenge")
