This movie is about a fictional novel. It's very fast and funny. To say anything else would ruin the movie. There are various graphics and sub-graphics in the movie. This movie has cast with the hottest stars of today. They all give the best performances. This movie is my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of any daytime soap opera or primetime soap !!! If you watch the soap go check out this movie, it's hilarious !!!
