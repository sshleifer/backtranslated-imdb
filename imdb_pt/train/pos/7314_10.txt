The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what struck me the most. I was expecting a bloody party, but instead I watched a highly intelligent killer mess with my head on a scary soundtrack (actually it's my touch at the moment: P). The fact that I could not predict when he would kill and when he disappeared was a big plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bothered me. Now, I know the plot had some discrepancies, but if you're like me you do not even realize it until long after the movie is over and you're lying in bed spanking the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in movement. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all-time favorite scores so I was very happy to know that Rob Zombie is leaving her untouched in her remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very comprehensive article on this, and now that I know that Mr. Zombie bows to John Carpenter, I have high hopes that he will interpret this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a desire for a tingle in the column, but it's the perfect complement, opener, end, his name for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
