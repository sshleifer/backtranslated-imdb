I was electrified when I first saw it in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is gone in the middle of the movie, but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I did not do it when finally in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and I heard the audience at a Christmas dance performance singing Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair was at its ends. There is much to learn from this story for all people.
