Funny. Sad. Lovely. These are all the words that floated in my head while I watched this beautiful and simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to really move me, but "Should We Dance?" accomplished this with grace to spare. Mild humor mixed with occasional subtle agony made it easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history. This left me with a feeling of exultation, but with a small touch of mixed sadness. <br /> <br /> And the dance, oh yes, the dance. Even if you are not an art lover, or you can not put one foot in front of the other, the steps shown here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can. It was absolutely charming, even the parts that show Sugiyama's footsteps (handsomely portrayed by Koji Yakusho) when he was learning to dance were adorable in a good-humored and childlike manner. And yet, this film was not entirely about dance, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We witnessed a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a handsome dance instructor rediscovering his love of art and the personal growth of all members of the wonderful support cast. <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and small agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a beautiful Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional force and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
