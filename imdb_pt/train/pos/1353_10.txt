The cast is different and now they have taken a different approach, we have the smart street team "Networth" vs.. the supposed professional staff "Magna", but boy, if you think the smart street team would have trouble to be right. While the Magna team has struggled a few times, the street team simply disintegrated week after week. <br /> <br /> First a few things to reiterate, to the extent that the "Apprentice 3" first continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: if you are a good project manager but lose , the team will turn against you and you will be fired despite the fact that your teammates are always the ones who do half the dumb job. Simply absurd, a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually "kills" the best, while dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone this season, we've seen a total of offensive, offensive, and even offensive gay stereotypes when teams try to campaign. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner these three are the only ones I feel were unfairly dismissed by Trump, the rest really happened because they just incited conflict, anger and suffering . It's simply amazing how a candidate, Audrey Evans, told how she did a good job and how some of her useless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the game, it's "The Apprentice." where manipulation, backstabbing, and ever popular "all gangs on top of the project manager" mentality rules. <br /> <br /> It has been a fun ride though, the candidates receive a wide variety of assignments from photo shoots to building mini golf courses, to building new apartments. <br /> <br /> Even so, it's still the "Apprentice", so all you can do is laugh all the time while insanity and chaos manifest until the lucky person is the winner.
