The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Arrow Run, Verboten !, Shock Runner, The Naked Kiss, The Big One Red, and this movie), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best movies noirs. Represents Fuller at its most controlled. I like it when it's out of control, of course, but almost everything in the Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm intended for communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and retrieve it. She finds him through a pigeon pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters' loyalty (this and the fact that she knows she's working for the Communists; the Cold War case is really interesting). The love story is made a little quick and not totally believable, but it's not so bad that it harms the movie (unlike Fuller's earlier film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This should be one of your best roles, but I'm not so familiar with your career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. His role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and its final scene in this film is as touching as any that you can find in the movies. I'll never forget that. 10/10.
