I first saw the Ice Age in the Cinemas Subiaco when it left in 2002. I was only 13 at the time, but still enjoyed it. There was some kind of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> We've had it on video for a few years and it does not matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is due to the element that makes it different from all other 3D animations made at the time - the characters do not have a particular 'house' they leave behind. They are nomads, and this is really invigorating and invigorating to watch. <br /> <br /> In addition, each individual character on the surface seems to be just hanging out, but they are all really good friends. In addition, all characters have their own charms (even the evil ones). Sid, the lazy, is charming in his annoying, overly affectionate, and naive form. Manny is adorable in his depressed and reclusive character, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another important point of the film is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled by clay, giving the film an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that contributes to the film's feel is that genre means very little. There are almost no female characters, but you really do not realize this until after watching it a few times and even then it has little effect on how you view the movie. Because of this, there is also no mention of a nuclear family that would be really pathetic in a scenario like the ice age. In all, the Ice Age is a great movie and is proof of how much effort was put into 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles show up.
