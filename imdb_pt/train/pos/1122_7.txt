Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately, they get a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder in the depths of the forest. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a nice low budget surprise. The cast is quite nice, the direction is firm and the violence is particularly unpleasant and misogynist. Especially the second murder is very serious. The assassin sheriff is not a one-dimensional character, some scenes seem to feel remorse for what he did. The subplot that surrounds the two boys they meet at the diner gets nowhere, but the chase scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.
