This film resembles in many ways the 'Enemy of the State' with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, as we have an innocent (black) man being pursued by 'government' with all the modern technology known to man. Usually, when the plot is copied like this, the result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course I love everything that David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this movie than about it. The main villain, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story flowed with great extras like David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), has angered most of the film. He's so out of place, making bad jokes, evoking any sympathy from the audience. Or, to begin with, the strange thing is that it grows in you (and in your followers too!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised by a good action movie with comedy. 7/10
