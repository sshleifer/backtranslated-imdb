<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw him in college in the early 1990s, and while I could not identify with the mid-thirties of the movie, I felt that the story, the characters, and the film were generally top-notch. For people who have spoken negatively about Indian Summer, feel free to keep your exaggerated Armageddon-like films and leave the films with a great, healthy story for those who can enjoy them.
