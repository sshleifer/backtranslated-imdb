The Trio vignettes were insightful and quite pleasant. It was curious to see so many of them soon being famous actors when they were very young. The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> Note. In the cinema it is not necessary that the source material is in alignment with the contemporary era is interesting or valuable. The narrative of "small morality" is singular (or demure) only in the eyes of the beholder - fortunately. The content of the story - well told - can overcome your time, subject or place. <br /> <br /> Ironically, there are some contemporary films today that have not surpassed the conventions or the most modern mores of the present era. The insertion of content of "small morality" - occasionally - can provide a deficient dimension.
