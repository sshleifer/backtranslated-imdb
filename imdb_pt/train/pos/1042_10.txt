An American woman, her husband and European children return to their mother's house in "Watch on the Rhine," a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman's play, and starring Paul Lukas (which I believe is repeating her role here ), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, a clandestine worker often wounded and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs long vacations on his wealthy mother-in-law's estate. But he finds that there is really no escape as one of the guests (Coulouris) is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> Great performances abound in this film, written very much to present the liberal point of view of Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful vehicle for propaganda at the time it was launched, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reached safe homes in the United States. The great controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar because of Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca". Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful onscreen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has about the need to kill is distressing, just to mention a scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what you think is a Bette Davis movie, it does a masterful performance here. Kurt's loyal and loving wife, Sara. His acting pulls the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie left me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everybody's cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes," she wrote some really nice and wonderful characters, plus a great story with Warner Brothers' A and Casting values. Highly recommended.
