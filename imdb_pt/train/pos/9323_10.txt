For me this movie was powerful. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; we were like brothers. This movie brought back some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I could not put my vote for this movie that would have been a 10. I kept getting a message like "No vote was placed ..." And yet I saw in the statistics that existed. I will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Minor flaws that I neglected. It was the relationships between the characters that got me. Beautifully acted and real situations. I've been to a couple of them. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie. Just like "Spring Forward" is another neglected gem. I'm very happy that movies like these are still being made; about relations between people, well written, sensibly deployed with first class performance and direction. After all, is not that what this is about?
