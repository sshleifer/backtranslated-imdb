I did not do any research on the film before my first screening because it was part of a Welles box that I had recently purchased. A box I acquired mainly because I wanted to have a man for all seasons and also reevaluate Waterloo. So I put Orson and Rita in the player and am treated with class and confusion to the same extent. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the story seemed simple, the man meets a beautiful woman and saves her from a couple. of bandits, they immediately click and the man gets a job offer on a cruise with his wife and his famous husband's lawyer, and then .............. the murder mystery of devil conspirators and many mischief. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) does not really know what's going on, he's just as confused as the viewer, and that's wonderful to see when he's pulled all over by just about everyone in the movie. Obviously being pulled by the strings of the heart by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has its moments, but you know things are going in pear shape. So many wonderful things in the movie, it has the visual style of Welles everywhere, see a scene in an aquarium that is wonderful and the final sequences in an amusement house are majestic in the eye. The narration of O'Hara is blithely self-mocking, and we have good light relief through a court case with Everett Sloane considerably brightening the process. <br /> <br /> However, the film is a weirdo and, in fact, it is an unstable viewing experience, because (as I was to find out later) studio bosses cut the film for almost an entire hour, and this is not only frustrating for us, the viewer, but unfair in Welles's view. I'm sure that a full original cut of that movie would have been praised and revered wholesale, since that's how we have a very good and intriguing film, which unfortunately only hints at greatness, but remains a devilishly captivating film that I'm happy to have to revisit more. 8.5 / 10
