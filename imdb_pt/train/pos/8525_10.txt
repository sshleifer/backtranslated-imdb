To rate this movie, you have to think about the genre it should be: childish. They had more guidelines to follow to make this movie (which means he could not get away with a bit of the humor and language of the first), having all this in this fun and enjoyable movie to watch. Sequels usually make me nervous, however this one did very well alone. Knowing they did not have the power of Fraiser's star like George, they capitalized on the mood and I believe Showeman did very well as the leader. The plot is easy to follow and perhaps overdone sometimes it fits well for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and wait for awards from the gym, that's not it, but if you want to watch a simple, full of energy you would make a good choice with this.
