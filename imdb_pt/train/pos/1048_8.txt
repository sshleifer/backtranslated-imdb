For Muslim women in West Africa, the lives of married women in the hands of abusive husbands can be very difficult. The community may not explicitly endorse such behavior, but equally, they may still not be ready to view it as a criminal, an attitude that, of course, allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of the Cameroonian law promises equality for all, and this documentary follows the real-life exploits of several women practitioners of the Cameroonian legal system in an attempt to secure justice for various women and children. What is remarkable (apart from the edifying central story) is how, despite their informality, the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought. The program also provides a fascinating insight into Cameroon's entire lifestyle, which (in addition to the terrible crimes committed in the cases presented) looks surprisingly emotional and cheerful compared to that enjoyed by Europeans or North Americans. And although I admit that this comment may betray naivete on my part, this attitude seems to be captured in delightful Englishmen who speak. Overall, this is a great movie, and a lot more fun to watch than you think.
