Val Kilmer ... I love or hate him, sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and takes a performance that makes you go 'Hey! This guy is a great actor! He did it in Jim's leather pants at The Doors and he did it again in John's leather underwear. Stirring around the fall and fall of uber porn king John Holmes, Kilmer gets on his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries that hollywood has ever solved for over twenty years with Holmes the main suspected of a brutal Manson-style killing. <br /> <br /> What Kilmer does so easily is exude the low life of the celebrity, do anything for anyone who wants to dominate who has it and then lose it. Go and see him, you will know what I mean.
