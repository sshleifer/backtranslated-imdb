Peter Bogdonavich made a handful of really great movies, and THE ALL ALL LAUGHED is one of his best. The cast could not be better equipped to play this light but somewhat bittersweet comedy. Curiously, the witty, light touch that Bogdonavich employs effortlessly gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins with absolutely no explanation. There is no soundtrack music to indicate us. We find the characters in action and, as Bogdonavich slides through the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures everything with a discreet simplicity that seems accidental, but it certainly is not. The cast is fantastic. In every way, a classic.
