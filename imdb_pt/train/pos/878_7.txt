Interesting characters, lots of tension. So close to black and white without being black and white. I was discouraged by the casual way in which the supposedly nice mainstream character, a quiet, almost deaf secretary, was able to turn the crime into a ruin of colleagues, chop down people on their way, and finally take part in an assault, and be bumped. off as a decoy for his own escape. I'm a bit disheartened by the tendency of quality movies to portray criminals sympathetically without addressing the injury they did to others other than portraying their immediate opponents as idiots. In this film, we never know who the money really is, or what happens to the innocent wife that the nice deaf secretary uses to set up the owner of the despicable bar to give the change for the missing service. Too bad, the movie could have been great.
