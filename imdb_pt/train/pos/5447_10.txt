Rules of personal taste when it comes to talking about movies like this little gem. Way back in the eighties, the early eighties, I discovered this movie, as so many released at the time, "Night Patrol" "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat" art and synopses on the back of the tried and joked It's clear that being of an age, movies like the one I've mentioned, as well as things like "Screwballs" and many others, have captured the imagination, and fortunately many years later I still remember some with affection and some with disdain the many films that help keep my love of genre like parodies or pastiches. <br /> <br /> It was many years after the huge success of "Animal House" and seeing how it had gone over the years, I now know that there would be no way for this film to eclipse the box office previously obtained, nor would it remain in memory, much like the National Lampoon vacation. Honestly, not everything that led the Lampoon national logo has been a wild success, however, so Reunion remains one of my all-time favorite movies with instantly recognizable characters such as Bob Spinnaker, who is so distant, interpreted to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good in Terrorvision, of Charles Band, still in the past glories of his youth. Or how about the bold and courageous return of Stephen Furst as the school lazy drunk crazed sex Hubert Downs. <br /> Sweet as. Which makes me reflect. As I already said, I personally like not to resist. People can be so cruel, so they will never win prizes or be compared to their peers in the comedy world. It has some merit. Being one of the earlier scripts written by John Hughes, he later came to make one of my favorites of his work "Weird Science" as well as having a wonderful title song sung by the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> What else can I say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered over and over again.
