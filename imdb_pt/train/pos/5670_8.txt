Esther Williams gets her first role at MGM and starts well. This film is a humorous thriller with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times in the future - an innocent girl chased after the haters of the creepy women. Esther looks great and if she wanted, she could probably have made more and better films, but according to her autobiography, she practically gave up working for the wedding. Anyway, she's so friendly and engaging that it's fun to watch her in a totally different role outside of the 'musical swimming'. Universal was terrific at making movies with former MGM stars after the studio began releasing its biggest names when it started to come down. Stars <br /> <br /> Like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others managed to make top-quality films at Universal, since they obviously still had the power of attraction at the box office. I wish Esther had done more, but since she did not do it, it makes everything even more special.
