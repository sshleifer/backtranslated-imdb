The Good Earth is a great movie! Everyone must see ... It's a shiver of tears and a lot of heart warming up. It addresses the enhancement of values ​​formation in perseverance, humility and love of the family ... History can be related to our life today, especially that poverty is on the threshold. The way we respond to this problem is very crucial, and if a person is not strong enough to face it, he can be helpless and helpless. I'm very pleased with the way the characters justified their roles, even the young actors ... Their emotions captivated the audience. The film may have been made in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end it. That makes it really great! There must be a makeover for this very good movie.
