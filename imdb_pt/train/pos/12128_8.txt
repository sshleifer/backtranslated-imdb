I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost scary movie. I loved how the music kept pace with every step of Philip's feet. It gave me goose bumps for some reason ... One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you start to see Bette Davis coming into her before your eyes. She's great, not necessarily because this is her best job, but because she was so out of the ordinary to be as cruel, brave and adamant as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different and that's right when she began to realize that she could be as unpleasant and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it. If you're a true movie lover, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She had only one way of delivering a line that was part, and the movie, for that matter, belongs to her. Like "A mass of music and fire. That's me ... an old kazoo and some stars" or "But you're Blanche, you're in that chair!" or "WITH ALL MY HEART, I STILL LOVE THE MAN THAT I KILLED!" ... These are from some of your movies, but you understand me. She was so brave, bold and exotic, looking with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe it was redone twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent, needing to be loved. I thought he was adorable and could not understand how everyone was not falling in love with him, but then again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The one thing I did not like was something that was common with writing in the early movies. They make such a hateful character that it is almost unbelievable that someone really falls in love with them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. This is just the simple truth ... See!
