Artemisia Gentileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed an early promise as a painter. Taught by her father, Artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side, art created by men. Her tragic life is narrated in this biopic directed and co-written by Agnes Merlik. After reading Susan Vreeland's novel The Passion of Artemisia, it made us investigate more about this woman's life, her work, and her legacy. We also read "Artemisia Gentileschi" by Mary Garrard, which should be a must read book for all art lovers. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" presents the fictional facts we read about showing the beginning of the young woman's life as she begins to paint. She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters of that period. His relationship and love with Tassi is the basis of the film. Artemisia, unfortunately, could not go as far as she could because of prejudice against women in the arts. It did not help nor did she cause a scandal where she is accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to go to Rome to distance herself from that unfortunate time of her life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Cervi makes beautiful artemisia. She is a beautiful creature who has aroused passion in men. Michel Serrault plays Orazio, his father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but ended up in jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a brilliant finish that Benoit Delhomme's camera work captures in all its splendor. The film's scenic locations provide an insight into what inspired that school of painting to show on its canvases. The music of Krishna Levy serves well what we see. Agnes Merlik drove with the right hand showing a visual style of its own.
