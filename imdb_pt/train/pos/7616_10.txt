Here is an innovative television drama; which so easily combines a compelling story, brilliantly designed character development, humor, romance and drama in each episode. Here's a show that sings for your own music, whether the audience chooses to follow or not. How many other shows on television these days so audaciously change the tone from one season to the next? Where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works, it attracts viewers and dollars and stuck to that formula (Prison Break, 24, and Desperate Housewives come to mind) - LOST takes a different route where , even after reaching that threshold and this winning formula, the executive producer team is brave enough to completely reinvent the program in order to meet its greater goal of compelling narrative. This is where LOST differs from normal television. This is how it challenges conventional TV. And that's why LOST is one of the most modern and innovative creations of modern television. Forget the pessimists - LOST is, has been, and always will be, there to appease your cult following first and the general public then. But it is a testament to his creativity that he has conquered a fan base that is the best of both audiences.
