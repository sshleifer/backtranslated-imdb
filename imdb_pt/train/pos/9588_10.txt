When Paris is Burning left, I totally discarded that. I was not at all Madonna phenomenon and fashion. I thought it was going to be exaggerated and silly. How wrong I was with this movie. I watched it after the movie was gone for ten years and I went out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt like I knew all the characters in person. The 80s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a fantastic job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original cast members were doing now, but I could not locate all of them. If anyone has any information about any of the cast members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another documentary. I LOVED
