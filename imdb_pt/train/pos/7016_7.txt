Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, I still think it's absolutely incredible. It will touch you, and unless you are a critic deeply pursuing the flaws and mishaps of all the movies, or just not being touched by anything, it is worth seeing. Do not enter the movie expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It's beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, though he is again playing another lonely depressed guy, is incredible. I believe a good actor is someone who can really portray feelings and emotions that we all have in our worst / best experiences in such a way that he approaches you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give a chance.
