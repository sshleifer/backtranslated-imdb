Although elements of the "The Eighth Day" plot seem to have been made many times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero," which will always remain on my list of favorites, the film still leaves us with many emotions. Daniel Auteil of 2001's "The Closet" underestimated his part, fearing exaggeration (with good reason, the role could have been easily ruined if the actor were too dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism, focusing more on the character itself than simply on the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not enter this movie expecting black humor and unexpected twists. you received it from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent film, if not flawed,
