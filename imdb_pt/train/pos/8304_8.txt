I got this movie late on a Saturday night / Sunday morning with my brother. We were drinking. This is one of the best shredding movies I've ever seen. From the luxury transatlantic, actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron to the doors with personal decals saying stickers, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this movie rocks! ! The continuity is so bad you can not help but notice, slap the face of the holes. In the final scene, he jumps out of a lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to her son and her new girlfriend (The PR director of ships who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was fired for doing things her way - true) on the ferry going very fast away from the blast. ...... Then the father is there hugging them. As???? Who cares, it's magic. There is no redeeming feature for this movie. The casino is the size of a large room with a casino table. when you're being chased by the villains, there's only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, continue to shoot up to four fruit machines and a small corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk right into the only hiding place, allowing our Casper to bypass them and 'take' them. <br /> <br /> Bring some friends, drink some, put this movie and howl.
