This film, in my opinion, is, despite its flaws (which I keep are few *), an absolute masterpiece and a great and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr. Bakshi did here is to create an extremely beautiful film and showed his immense talent and versatility as an animated film director. He does not receive 1/100 of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. If it were not for Mr. Bakshi, I do not believe the animation would have survived the Disney massacre. In addition, with The Lord of the Rings, he not only created a beautiful animated film, but he created a whole new art form - unfortunately one that was never made of paper. <br /> <br /> Most people complain about the use of rotoscopy in the film (the use of live action images that are used as background images and often animated using various techniques of what appears to be a small amount of tint for a full animation). But I feel that people who complain simply can not accept an art form that is outside the norm. No, this is not Disney animation. No, it's not live action. No, it's not "cheating" - which is a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so new and so new that feels completely at home in a tale as fantastic as "The Lord of the Rings". Bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings to life the subtleties of Middle-earth is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darker of Tolkien's creatures, particularly the Nazgull, are performed in a way that traditional animation or action The script by Peter S. Beagle (based very little, as I understand it, in a first draft of Chris Conkling) is a very faithful adaptation of Tolkien's works. Whenever possible, he uses dialogue directly from the novel and feels at home in the world that Bakshi has created. There are many cuts made to fit in the first book and 3/4 in a single film of 2 hours and 15 minutes, but there are few changes in the plot. There are some holes that would have been nice to have filled in: the Narsil reforge, Galadriel's gifts, the Huorns at the Battle of Hornburg, but again, with the time constraints he had (already the longest animated feature in history) , these are certainly understandable (although one admires how they might have been explained in a continuation). <br /> <br /> There is also the delightful (one of my favorite) sheet music by Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score for which is clearly based on his work of SdA)). It's bombastic and audacious and, I daresay, perfect. It stands out as an orchestral triumph, but when coupled with the film's images, it enters into a new world of symphonic perfection. So far from the typical Hollywoodland food that it turns many people off. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. Of particular interest is John Hurt as Aragorn who just exudes the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character design is also wonderfully unique, though not always for everyone. But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show what he imagines, not what you might have imagined, and then Aragorn is performed with a distinctive Native American feeling and Boromir appears in Viking inspired costumes. This may not be what you imagined, but I can only applaud Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he "saw". It may also be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing the character clothing for the film. <br /> <br /> A word more distant - the Flight to Ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the most subtly beautiful sequences to be captured on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down for a moment, and his mastery is clearly demonstrated by the incredible tension he is able to build. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's incredible work merge in this sequence to a glorious peak that still needs to be matched. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers' recent DVD release (2001) is missing. Although we can offer our eternal thanks for the fact that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package unfortunately has no extras. How glorious it would have been to have had a comment from the director, was able to see the 20 minutes of extra scenes that were removed for the theatrical version. Another delightful addition could have been the setting up of live action footage that was later enlivened. Also present at the release of the DVD is the utterly horrible voice at the end of the film, which is a departure from the simple narration that occurred in the final frames of the film. This version is stamped and poorly rendered on the musical climax of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made. We will never be able to see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, Cracks of Doom, Eowyn's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him. We will never be graced with the image of Denethor of Bakshi or the Palatir or the Paths of the Dead. It is a shame beyond all shame that we, in the end, have to accept the brilliance and brilliance of Peter Jackson in Hollywood, action movie version of these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I suppose it is better than not having a cinematic version everything. <br /> David
