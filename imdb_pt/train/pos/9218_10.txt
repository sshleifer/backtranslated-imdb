First, let me say that I wanted to see this movie about a year ago because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love it. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the film. Anyway, no video store was carrying it, but low, and behold, the local library did. I watched and absolutely loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was well done and fun. It was not degrading in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did a superb job. I laughed a lot about sexual humor. Overall, I think it's worth seeing this movie if you can find it. It's lovely and just fun to watch. I rarely classify movies as 10, but I give this a 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Go and see!
