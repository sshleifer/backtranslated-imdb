I had never heard of this movie until I ran into it by accident while browsing IMDB. I saw that he had gotten many terrible reviews containing very colorful profanity about how much he stunk. Of course that meant I had to see. I was pleasantly surprised how Whipped really is a good movie. I watched with a group of friends and laughed more than we had at Hollywood's many complimentary comedies. This is an independent film and as such portrays its subject (sex and dating) without the usual fame of Hollywood. I clearly suspect that the opinion of the people about this film will depend a lot on your life experience. If you have never dated or celebrated much, you will not have this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If so, you will recognize many of the situations you have comically portrayed here. The ending was also good, as it did not portray women as romantic manly, unrealistic and unreal, in contrast to many Hollywood movies.
