This movie has big stars in its early years: Ingor Stevens never looked more handsome; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte in conflict over his piracy and wishing to remain neutral with the United States. Charlton Heston did a good job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit forced. It's really a good movie for students to learn this part of our story, and it shows that all happy endings DO NOT include lovers getting together - sometimes the happiest ending is that they leave and find similar background partners who will understand them the best in the long run. I see him every year at least twice for 16 years; and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
