If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed with THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare documentary feature many of Yankovic's most memorable videos ("Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" among them), but they are intertwined with funny vignettes that supposedly highlight the parody's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for everyone, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans are at least slightly entertaining. Inveterate fans will love not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look at Yankovic's nearly three decades career. Suitable for all ages, children will no doubt love the funny visuals.
