While prices have risen sharply, and some of the details have become obsolete, any homeowner struggling with property issues should make a lot of laughs at that movie. I know you do. Mr. Blandings, a New York ad executive, decides to move his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a beautiful house there. It goes into a hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties, as construction costs and schedule continue to rise out of control. I thought the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well of water. They dig hundreds of meters, but never find water. However, only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of your future floods! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give convincing performances like the tormented Blandings couple, dominated by problems they never imagined and Melvyn Douglas is even better as a lawyer and friend of the Blanding family. The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is pictured as a naive idiot who has no idea how many additional problems she is causing, and there is a black maid ( horrors!). So do not watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll have even more fun. <br /> <br />
