I could not take my eyes off this movie when it appeared on the cable. Dialogue and costumes are of a quality more readily associated with soft-core pornography. In this case, the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex, but for serial beats with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex too, but not on Indian TV anyway.) <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of the genre, I could not put Jeff Wincott, and I had no clues to search. Only once did Brigitte Nielsen change her futuristic nurse outfit (so, Mayor!) For the high-quality fading that we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II, I made a positive identification of her. <br /> <br /> This film will not doubt any admirer of the early 90's, or the idiot and wink of Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a gender tag to "so-bad-it-good"?
