I've seen tons of science fiction from the '70s; some horrendously bad, and others found it provocative and truly scary. Soylent Green fits the last category. Yes, sometimes it's a little overdone, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but part of the film seems very prescient. Here we have a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, scary and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson do much better at this than The Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assisted suicide scene is frighteningly prescient for Kevorkian and his gang. Some of the attitudes are dated (you can imagine a filmmaker escaping from the concept of "women as furniture" in our 80s, but it's rare to find a Me-DÃ©cade movie that really can make you think.This is one I'd love to see in the big screen because even in a widescreen presentation, I do not think the overall scope of this movie would get what it deserved.
