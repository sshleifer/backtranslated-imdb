I think the team behind this movie did a great job with the limitations they had. only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, shoot and edit everything I think is an achievement in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as an innocent young teenager is dead and there is a homo-eroticism involved in the story) I think this movie is a painful tragedy and the more deeply involved you go into the story, the sadder movie you feel. more to Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British films that I really enjoyed and would watch again. I think it's a shame the film is not very well heard.
