I was living Rawlins when this movie was made and I was lucky enough to be able to work on it. Both as extra and with Eddie Surkin in special effects. It was fun to see all the work behind the scenes, from the Barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair to the floor of the guards' office. It was also a lot of fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called "Disney Gate" by locals. If anyone is interested and is always in Rawlins, most movie sets are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was a lot of fun to work with R. Harlin and I wished I had the chance to do it again.
