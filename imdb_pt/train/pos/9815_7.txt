Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released years later), it's worth watching. De Niro's role is not great, but fun as one of two friends who first try to stop other friends from marrying just to chase after him to force him into it. Any De Niro fan will get along with an initial performance, possibly the best actor of today.
