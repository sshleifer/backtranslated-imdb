Before watching this movie, I thought that this movie would be great as Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last movie of Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong that I watched earlier. As for the sexual scenes, I was disappointed, I thought that the Dreamquest's sexual scenes would be great as a Flashpoint sexual scene, but I was disappointed. Except the sex scene of Asia Carrera, any sexual scene in this movie does not make me feel good (you know what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson does not do such sexual scenes of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, both lovely girls, disappoint me as much as sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Although it's an adult movie, but if you let go of the sexual scenes factor, this movie is very good. If typical adult movie standards are concerned, this movie has definitely raised the standards of adult movies. History, acting, direction, sets, makeup and other technical things of this film are great. The actors in this movie did a great job, everyone did a great job. Dreamquest is definitely raised the quality level of adult movies.
