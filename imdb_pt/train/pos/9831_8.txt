We have high expectations with this one. . . because his Zombie 3 is the official sequel to Zombie 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . Yet . . . He is co-directed by Bruno Mattei (of Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and his shot in the Fiilines like Night of the Zombies and resembles the Night of the Zombies the Living Dead). as a result, it's more like a companion to Hell of the Living Dead than Zombie 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis who produced Zombie 2 and his publisher Tomassi (?) and De Rossi's Gianetto gave Zombie his magic. . . Zombie 3 is not magic. . . It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut butter. But over the years, I came to accept Zombie 3. I could swear I saw a version in which a soldier was bitten on the arm and went into the hotel room. . . there was a cut of Fulci without sense and the cut of Mattei / Fulci is the one of the DVD.
