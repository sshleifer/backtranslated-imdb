This movie had terrible reviews, but because it was eccentric and because critics generally do not "get" eccentric movies, I thought I'd try. Unfortunately, they were largely right in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also has an unpleasant feeling, which is very bad. The kind of feeling that is impossible to describe, but it is not good. To further confuse things, the script is a dull, aimless thing that is vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The immensely talented Thurman just goes through this mess making only one impact. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with an enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. It might have been less embarrassing for them if they had simply chosen to skid and end it like Thurman. <br /> <br /> One thing that the "esteemed" movie critics failed to mention is that the movie is actually. pretty funny. Whether it be precise satire or some outrageously odd moments like when the cowgirls in question hunt from the ranch with the smell of their dirt ... ahem ... on the underside of the front. <br /> <br /> Because of the laughter reached everywhere, while I would not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to be had and watching Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is worth for something different.
