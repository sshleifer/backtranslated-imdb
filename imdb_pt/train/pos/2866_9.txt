I grew up in this classic western series, and as a child I always considered a treat being allowed to stay up late on Sunday nights to watch it. Bonanza is still infinitely possible to read. <br /> <br /> The series chronicles the adventures of the Cartwright family, who lives on a farm near Virginia City, Nevada, at the time of the Civil War. His ranch (named Ponderosa) is executed and defended by his widowed father, Ben, and his three unmarried sons, Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, who died years before. <br /> <br /> The Cartwright are a working, prosperous, and honorable family, highly respected in these parts. The Ponderosa is large, thus reaching its ends requires a lot of horseback riding. In addition, travel is often required to buy or sell cattle and so on. Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uninterrupted. Although hospitable, much of Cartwright's energy must be spent defending his ranch from intruders, or protecting himself from city dwellers jealous of his prosperity and stellar reputation. The Cartwrights do a little firing their guns in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when considered absolutely necessary. They are involved in various matters of the city, even in the political life of the territory of Nevada. <br /> <br /> One of the main features of the series is the underlying heat that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and his friends. three children and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers. Now one brother can hit another once in a while, but he usually has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts for long! The characters are all very well designed. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The eldest son, Adam, the most rational and gentle of the brothers, came out in the middle of the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a bit shy around women. The youngest, the little Joe, is a charming and attractive, who, on the contrary, has a good way with women. This sibling trio enjoys several novels, but their love interests are typically dead by the end of the episode, or the marriage proves impossible, for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The actors are all stellar in their roles, including Pernell. Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe) and, of course, Lorne Greene as the patriarch of the family of principles, Ben. I also love the cook of the ranch, Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Yung. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful western packaged action with great values. Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys are very vile. If only there were more shows like this vintage western on TV nowadays!
