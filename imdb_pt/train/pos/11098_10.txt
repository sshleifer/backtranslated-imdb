Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in The Sopranos. he died of a shot in the eye. This was the best and well orchestrated scene of all the Sopranos. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone must haunt Uncle Jr in his dreams until Uncle Jr can not stand it anymore. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode # 3, denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy will live forever. Brendan Filone is the best character in Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character of all time. I recommend this show to anyone who likes Drama and wants to see scenes of good death and great direction and production, because there is nothing better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
