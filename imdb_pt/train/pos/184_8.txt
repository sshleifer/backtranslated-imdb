There are no people like "Show People" Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (as Billy Boone). My introduction to Ms. Davies was a "clip" of this film; to deliciously sarcastic in that she lowers a handkerchief to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was in seeing this movie, currently; however, it is possible that I have seen you in a less memorable role. Haines has an incredible impression when he joins Davies for a commissioner's meal - tossing his hat in the ring with some wonderful pieces on the dinner table. In fact, Haines and Davies have great comedic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Davies's daughter, Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), heading for Hollywood, certain that it will become the newest Tinseltown sensation. In fact, Davies and the already-arrived Haines become comedy stars. But, Davies longs to become a true drama queen. Davies leaves Haines and partners with the dashing and dramatic Paul Ralli. But the public prefers Davies in more comedic roles; perhaps the director King Vidor is offering a case for art imitating life? <br /> <br /> Full of great filming in Hollywood, on set and off. Full of great "cameos"; in a studio lunch at the table of stars, Davies stands between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best player "bit", however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough courage to ask for his autograph for Davies! While cameos are fun, they and the episodic sequences help "Show People" become a less important film, and another important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
