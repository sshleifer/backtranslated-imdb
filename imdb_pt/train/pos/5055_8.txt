I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story began, unfolded in a beautifully photographed and stimulated film. I was surprised and delighted with this (basically) true story. It made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means the director accomplished his purpose, and the film was a success!
