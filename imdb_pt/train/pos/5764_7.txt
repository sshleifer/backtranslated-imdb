I originally reviewed this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and blow it up. I believe I called it "miserable" and a "turkey". Okay, well, by most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no production value, the little plot that exists makes almost no sense, and the performance is at the level of a third-grade play. That being said, this has really grown in me over the years as a kind of classic field. In fact, all director Todd Sheets' films had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood in this respect: watch them over and over again and choose the broken lines, the continuity errors (the same zombie, two different locations!) And other flaws. <br /> <br /> Say this: Sheets is a really nice guy, and meanwhile, one of his first productions, is not so good, he got better. And I should add that the only really decent actor / actress in the film is Kasey Rousch, although I may be biased since I went to school with her.
