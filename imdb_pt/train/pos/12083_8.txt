The second appeal concerns a young woman in London desperate for a job, happy to accept a secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a bit uncomfortable - I end up feeling like a prisoner too - but this pretty B-movie is neither rainy nor claustrophobic. It's overdone and unlikely, but not unattractive, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is swift at her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (as "Dead Of Winter") proved not to be wise, as the plot elements are not of the modern day. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (very short at 65 minutes!), But keeps heading to a very rushed climax, which seems a bit sloppy. *** in ****
