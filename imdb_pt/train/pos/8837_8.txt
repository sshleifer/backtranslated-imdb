My personal sentiment is that you can not divorce this film from its political / historical basis, as many (American) reviewers tend to do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia, at a time when it was divided between the East and the West. Just as the guys are split between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is torn between the "Tovarish Joe" and the guys. There is shame in certain situations that are lost in an audience that has never lived under Titus. I feel that the film is underestimated and it's a shame we lost the director. Movies like this make freedom seem more important. It's not just "another Eastern European coming-of-age film" ... it's a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking with a thin line that can eventually lead them to real freedom.
