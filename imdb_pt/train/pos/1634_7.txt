I got the first movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and at 15 I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember not seeing the depictions of Alfred E. Neuman shown in the theater trailers. When MAD Magazine filled the film and abruptly halted midway with excuses from the "gang ever" for lowering themselves to satire, I assumed they were mocking themselves, which I'm sure they were, but seriously find (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Certainly there are many worse movies to associate. Watching the video movie now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where the Poppa?) I think it's the crown jewel of his performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
