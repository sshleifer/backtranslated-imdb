This 1947 film starred and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with an Irish accent) and also stars the beautiful Rita Hayworth with less attractive short blonde hair. So I went out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man, but that was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first date was good, she does a great job of playing the scared and cautious Elsa, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall in love with each other. He wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband and her partner fight and bite, as well as the sharks Mike describes, attacking each other and their prediction is very true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery when we climax at the amusement house. (Think of the end of the shooting in The Man with the Golden Gun, which borrowed from that scene). I was not sure who the killer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like shrimp with garlic and lemon. The dish is centered in the sea, is subtle, sour and spicy, all with great effect. These may not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The tasty sauce enhances the naturalness of pink shrimp as you fill in a healthy alternative but that fills the most ordinary common cooking. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
