Some of the posters look less than dirty because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but clearly he does not pretend to be either. You'll look a lot to find a bigger fan of Rodgers and Hart than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly chopped liver, plus they knew Der Bingle from the inside out and adapted some great tunes - but Linda, Moonlight Becomes You It's Always You, The Day After Forever, etc. - to suit your highly personal style and here they come with another ballad very well - and unfairly neglected - the Once And For Always, plus some upbeat entries of philosophy- lite in If you Stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing. The fragile plot is not to be taken seriously - why else do heavy Merlin when in most, if not all, of the other versions he is more of Arthur's friend / mentor - so if you start wondering out loud why Sir Lancelot was sold to historians as the epitome of the metamorphosis of chivalry and honesty in a schoolyard bully that you will not have much fun with what is essentially a fun movie. In the swing does what he sets out to do, entertain, so good luck for that.
