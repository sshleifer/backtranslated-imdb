I've wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had touched some of my favorite movies of all time. When I watched Valentine, I was amazed at how big the storyline really was. This kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. The actors and actresses interpreted the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so bright and clever. Some scenes were a bit unbelievable and or poor, and I admit that in some smaller parts, it got a bit annoying, but overall it was non-stop fun and suspense. It had a mental plot that made you guess the whole way and did not deserve all the crap he gets. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it will sure give you a good dose of chills. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer or rating, please do not ...
