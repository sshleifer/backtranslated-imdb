In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and disturbed man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan has trouble discussing his more intimate feelings with his wife. Alan repeats his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life by sending him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Queen over me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family, and solitude. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Saffron Burrows, Alan. But the family drama works, backed by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is completely impossible to be recognized, I do not know if she is wearing excessive makeup to look older, but her face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reina Sobre Mim")
