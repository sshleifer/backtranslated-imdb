I got into this movie thinking it would be a low quality movie. I was surprised and very funny. Eva was good, but Bell Lake stole the show. She had incredible comedic timing. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and very funny with one or two jokes in the middle. The plot was enough to tie him all together, a woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day and back to haunt the woman who is hanging out with her future husband, her fancy sounds, but actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall it's a worthwhile movie watch, if it's not on DVD when you leave.
