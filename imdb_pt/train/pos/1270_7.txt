This movie is really a bag. On the one hand, the story and concept of the film are very good, tense and have some twists in the plot. But again, on the other hand, everything is said very slowly, without style and without involvement. I still consider "Just Cause" as an above-average thriller simply because of the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery has been misused in his role. I mean, he's not really as believable as the main "hero" and father of a young daughter (played by an even very young Scarlett Johansson, by the way) and Kate Capshaw's husband. I feel he was simply too old for the paper to be really reliable. However, Sean Connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason he is still able to take the film as well as he does. But of course he is aided by a very solid support cast consisting of actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All the actors are really good, but some of them are highly underutilized at the same time, which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is totally great in his role as a serial killer psychopath. He is really relaxing and acting superbly. Usually he does not do that kind of chilling, creepy role in movies, so he really surprises with his role in that movie. His performance alone is already enough reason to watch this movie. However, due to the fact that the story is told without much style and very stereotypical, none of the characters in the movie really works well because it seems too far away. <br /> <br /> It's really the way to tell stories. which kills the entire movie its good potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film with little style and keeps the pace very low at times. Because of this, we as spectators never get involved with the story or with any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It really is a pity, because "Just Cause" had more than enough potential. A beautiful cast and a story with some unexpected twists, in which nothing is what it seems. The cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller, which will probably still please the fan of the genre. However, it is a shameful shame the lack of stories and styles of the film, or else this film could have been a true classic in its genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
