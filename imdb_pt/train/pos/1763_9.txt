This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. had cruel moments, but they were full of charm. it's an alchemical script, a brilliant physical humor and relaxed friendships have been a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life that most of us can relate to. and I can tell with a measure of honesty that I was scared of Steve Carell's nipple..I really was. Surprisingly, this is a good-natured, blatant comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we can find ourselves along the way. Catherine Keener was great as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were imperfect, but kind and very funny. the idea that they suspected Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
