The talented detective Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his overseas trip to investigate a seemingly severed and dry suicide case that he has good reason to suspect that it is really something much more, a rather deliciously complex murder! <br /> <br /> When it comes to mystery movies, there is nothing better than this. Populated with suspicious characters, all attached to a dog show and all having very good reasons to kill the apparent victim Archer Coe, it's really hard to figure it out or roll his head around it, but kid, is it fascinating to see that happen? before us. Even the cops, the coroner, and the prosecutor prove colorful characters that add an unexpected level of realism to their procedures and increase their "fun" factor. I particularly enjoyed the comedic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who is always seems to be rudely interrupted by the discovery of dead bodies or wounded men during the execution time. Also Eugene Palette's detective, sergeant. Heath offers welcome, often after deliciously humorous at his expense, critical commentary during Vance's investigation. I can not think of any valid criticism for giving this film, except, perhaps, that it did not come out particularly well. It does not stop the movie from being just good fun. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this mystery. Highly recommended you try it!
