Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animated sequences and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when children and Mary disappear in sidewalk art). I am mainly evaluating this film through the eyes of the child because I have not seen it for years. Back then, it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict beginning with the ghostly armor that entered the battle) were my favorites. There was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells (ie, people turning into rabbits), which may be a bit old-fashioned and silly now. (Also, I believe the film starts slowly.) Through a child's eyes, this is a fun movie and it's easy for kids to put themselves in the children's places in the movie. It is an imaginative film that today is sadly forgotten.
