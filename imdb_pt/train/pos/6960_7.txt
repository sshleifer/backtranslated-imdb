A desperate action guy tries to hit a beautiful girl on a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone trying to steal his purse, they come together anyway. And there it begins - a relationship that is mildly tarnished by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them will be problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that could promise to grow into a cool movie. And IMO, it can be a good movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it's left me in tears to laugh on more than one occasion - the two main characters spin on each other at a crazy love festival that is, even with the superhero thing, believable. <br /> <br /> So fine history, but it worked very funny and therefore worthy of film time. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
