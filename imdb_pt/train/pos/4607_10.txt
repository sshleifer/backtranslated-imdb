My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 film, "Police Story". In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super cop who catches a notorious criminal lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so she can turn the state's evidence. As the story continues, the gangster sends his henchmen to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes things in his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung in the distance. As "Drunken Master", "Police Story" has many of the acrobatics and choreography of action and martial arts that Chan has become famous, culminating in a real battle in a crowded mall. In his role as director, Chan excels at excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action. While the light on the slapstick humor of "Drunken Master" in the heart "Police Story" is just that, a police story, a brave cop that would often be copied over the years. <br /> 10/10
