After reading the comments for this film and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to add my dime to say that I thought the film was excellent, not only in visual beauty, writing, score, acting, and directing, but in describing the story of Joseph Smith and the road, he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew as his way. I am very pleased, in fact, for having played a small role in telling the story of this remarkable man. I commend all of you to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter which religious path it leads to, it only inculcates the person with more determination to live the life we ​​owe with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness as the Savior has taught us. do it.
