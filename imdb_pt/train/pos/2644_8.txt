I do not know what it is that I find so captivating about this movie, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or of war dramas, but I was really wondering how and when Winfield would find his son. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. Truth be told, I have not seen this movie for years or been shown on TV for some time, but this movie is a bit of a man's odyssey after the pains of war. Winfield shows a very nice and warm portrait of a man lost in his memories. There is an underlying message in this film that he is looking for the last fragment of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality it confronts. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
