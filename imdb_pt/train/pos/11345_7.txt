That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying movie (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A boy sets off on a magical journey to an island. . The island's mayor, Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon, looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me, and a talking magic flute are targets of a witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered "a little right" at the time). <br /> <br /> The flute is reclaimed at an 'interesting' witches' convention, with witches having a gay old time. The boy dresses in drag like a 'fairy' to retrieve the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
