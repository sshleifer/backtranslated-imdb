I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and I just graduated from high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Hod Workers' and Trade Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to carry a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc., for a week or two. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego. Shortly after, we stopped at an army base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were nestled, we headed north, a few miles to Camp Pendleton, the great navy base. There, on the beach, we began to build what should be a Pacific Island Japanese base. It took about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun trenches, sand trenches and lodges. All this was with a very high salary, sometimes "golden time," which was three times our regular hourly wage. Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc - which was amazing because it was wartime and very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> Once the work was finished I waited anxiously for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. So I waited anxiously for two hours of the movie before my work finally appeared on screen. Then there were no more than three or four minutes (perhaps less) of the movie's heroes plunging into the base and exploding into tiny pieces. A little disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I liked the movie and have not seen it since. I knew after this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost basis more, which perhaps explains our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there. Bob Weverka
