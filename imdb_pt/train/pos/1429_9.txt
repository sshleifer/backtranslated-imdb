I loved the way the earth is made. His photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, your music and sound editing makes EARTH a deep experience you can not miss. You really are on a journey to where you probably would never end up alone. <br /> <br /> And although at first I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience when we see animals in their daily struggle for survival, I could not help laughing sometimes. Nature simply seems too impressive to be understood. <br /> <br /> But instead of the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question: "How can 200 years of industrial revolution destroy the natural systems that have been here?" thousands and thousands of years? "With that question in mind, you will understand how I felt somewhat bitter and helpless after seeing EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we've gone through in the last few centuries and stop global warming all at once (all this not being an NGO activist!) ... So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of movie to see what I could do to save our still fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate. (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a bit disappointed not to find direct answers to my questions.However, it was very interesting to find out more about the movie and the fight that the crew faced. <br /> <br /> I hope the cut in my energy use will serve.I do not know how to reduce the distance that polar bears have to swim to get to the ground before they drown or tie who animals that can not win in their exhausted state ... <br /> <br /> An inspiring film, but I did not leave the movies feeling very happy.
