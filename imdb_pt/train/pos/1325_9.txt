I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was intrigued by all 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but often think they drag with about 25 minutes to go. Forbidden lie, but never losing my interest. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical tale of types about a Muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family relationship by having a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, some journalists began to drill holes in the story, prompting the public to believe it was a fraud. The film covers this quickly but completely at the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in Norma's company as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study and conduct endless interviews with Khoury while looking for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about the violent setback on the nasty picture of her novels about the Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and shows us the facts. Broinowski is not dissuaded, however, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con man. Of course, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow and, ultimately, we do not know whether we believe in Norma or not. She's a pretty unfair woman trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. The web of lies, truths and half-truths she conveys through the film is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses many interviews as well as dramatizations to tell its story, and Broinowski uses these role plays to show us why people like Norma are capable of existing: we want to be deceived. We go to the movies every day and allow ourselves to believe that what is happening on the screen is real. This may just be me reading things a little too much, did not show up in the Q & A session with Brionowski after the movie, but that's what I got out of it. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian movie, and should receive an international release, and a series of awards, if you ask me. Certainly the best movie I saw on AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go see if you have the chance.
