I read the other reviews and found some to be comparing the movie v real life (eg, what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc, etc, so let's focus on the movie and the message. <Br/> <br /> I rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the 8-14 age group and for a family movie. For the average adult ... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock, I'm 45 years old. I know about Britney Spears, but I never realized she actually sang Stronger until I read the credits and these reviews. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I did not bother with any 'self promotion'. <br /> <br /> I watch movies to entertain myself. I do not care about cast, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and that entertains me? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the message. The biggest epidemic in the world is the low self-esteem (which is a totally different story), as observed with the message in mind, as this is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and cheerful, great for kids. I found that the Texan accent began to fade throughout the film and of course there are only so many ways to convey the message of giving up / do not give up, so it was a bit predictable. Great message, though ... should be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie for the family, but for a man who is watching alone, get Hannibal.
