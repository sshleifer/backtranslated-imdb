"That '70s Show" is definitely the funniest show currently on TV. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I could tell it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an incredible character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's hilarious. It's classic when Fez says "you son of a bitch!", And when Kelso yells "burn!", That always makes me laugh. Both are great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; She started to be very pretty, but damn, somewhere around the 5-6 season she got really hot. I've seen most episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and still hilarious. This is one of the few shows I can watch over and over and still laugh as much as the first time I saw it. The cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I'll be sad to see this show end next year, but it will go off the air as one of the best shows ever.
