Well, I think I'm emotionally attached to this movie, since it's the first one I've been seeing more than 10 times in the movies ... helping me in my master's thesis, or rather, preventing me from working on it! <BR> <BR> But seeing him again several years (and many films) afterwards - what a small gem well crafted is! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where is a man like that? <<< sigh >>> The time of Sophie Thompson as Mrs. Bates is the virtuous performance of the best (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is also no disappointment - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet , and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Of course the scenery, costumes and beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to positive feeling, almost like a Hobbiton. atmosphere of the film - although with regard to cinematography and art decoration, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very, very beautiful, but a little more austerity could have conveyed a better sense of period. But the good thing is that the film does not take itself too seriously, and there's a lot of fun - and some pretty cool issues - that keep it from sinking into Merry Old England saccharine mode. <br /> <br /> One of the favorites is the dance scene - some beautiful performances and direction here, and the final dance sums up the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley simply beautifully. Too bad that the final proposal's scene lasts too long - cut two shots (I can think of exactly which ones!) And would have been much more in tune with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Wow, I just realized (reading the imdb listings) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even realizing it was him - it seems that he has a lot more for him as an actor than who being just a chivalrous English heartthrob! Hmm, I think I need to pay a visit to my video store ... Lovely movie. My favorite adaptation of Jane Austen so far - although perhaps Sense and Sensibility by Ang Lee is, strictly speaking, the best film, this is the closest to my heart - and I've certainly seen it many times! Watch if you can - and do not be too hard on your little imperfections. <br /> <br />
