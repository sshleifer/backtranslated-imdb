I saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. You may question some creator decisions - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie certainly hits you in the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. I hope you receive the distribution you deserve.
