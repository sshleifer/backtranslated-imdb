When an actor has to play the role of actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman outdid himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He has put all his talent and sincerity in this character. Facial expressions, mannerisms, posture and posture spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also performed very well as a Shakespearean actor in the short scenes like Othello, who were part of that gem of a movie. Closings of Coleman's face as Othello was tortured by doubts about Desdemona's fidelity were in themselves scenes worthy of attention. Add to that the despair of your character off stage and only someone with Coleman's depth perception of acting can achieve. It was like watching Spenser Tracy like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much deeper and more poignant. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added her talent to the film. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would watch this movie repeatedly and would never feel bored.
