I knew, but I'd never seen Gray Gardens before I'd seen the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends warned me that if I had not seen the movie, the musical would not make sense. I did, but it also led me to rent the movie. At first, I thought it was a train disaster, full of strange characters, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But being able to stop it, digest it and get back to it made me realize why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Edie Grande and Edie Pequena are unforgettable and their total lack of self-awareness is worth witnessing. Both remain beautiful despite their time of invasion. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you reexamine your own relationships with your mother. In an age when reality shows and movies are common, it's fascinating to see the work of the Mayles in three decades ago and realize the impact the film must have had. <br /> <br /> I echo what other posters have said. : how were they allowed to slip into such misery by their family? But besides, how did two people living in the 1970s manage to escape reality so completely? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I recommend seeing this with the comment track, which gave me an additional insight into the movie.
