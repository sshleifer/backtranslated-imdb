'The Luzhin Defense' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it's a heavy and intense movie, and it kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his interpretation of an eccentric chess grandmaster contest, and Emily Watson is fascinating as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is obvious from the moment his characters meet in history. All in all, this movie is one of the best deep looks on the life of a Grandmaster of chess, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-clich√© feel to the movie. Most people will get out of theatrical thinking and feel somewhat touched by that brilliant look in the most unlikely of love stories.
