Vaguely based on James J Corbett's biography "The Roar of the Crowd," Jim Gentleman is a wonderfully cheerful image that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilist prancer that was Corbett but also the wind of change with regard to the sport of boxing circa 1890. The story follows Corbett {a perfectly founded Errol Flynn} from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico through a chance to fight with a former boxing champion which eventually leads to him battling the fearsome world heavyweight champion John L Sullivan (beefcake personified delightfully by Ward Bond). Not all the fights are in the ring, and it's all the twists in Corbett's life, which makes this a great entertainment scene. There are class issues to be overcome here (perfectly played when club members pay to overthrow him), and Corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his peers, but he must also outgrow his ego. as it grows as fast as its reputation. Along with the wonderful Corbett family, and all their stoic and comedic support, Corbett's journey is as catchy as it is cheerful, but as impetuous and daring as he is, he is a very nice character, and is a character who fits the brand. The film never gives up for a moment, and it's a proof from director Raoul Walsh that, while we're waiting anxiously for the final fight, the events in the outer ring keep us firm. entertained, not even the love interest sub plot harms this photo {thank you Alexis Smith}. The fight sequences look great, and show perfectly how Corbett became the champion he was, his brand of dance rings around slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history. As the final rolls roll, we all descend to Earth as a post-fight encounter between Sullivan and Corbett puts all brutality into context, and it is here that humility and humility become the absolute winner, and as far as that spectator goes ... .......... it will make for sure to be sure, 9/10 for a truly wonderful image.
