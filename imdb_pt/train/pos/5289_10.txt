John Waters made the most effusive, heartfelt, dark, and personal movie I've ever seen in my life (well, maybe Fast Food Fast Women comes close) The directors' vision is immaculate ... the narrative is capricious, the characters are personal and strange reflections of the family and of his own inner life ... the tone never forced or stylistically exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious shot design, boredom or magazine rating. Plimpton is amazing as the sister..Eddie furlong is the inspired cast. A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea bagging, recycled clothes, yesterday's garbage becomes the art of today - and the movie's lesson is that the most important thing we can value is the family ... and a humble life .
