I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it, in fact, I am very, please, have this movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, filmmakers, took less than a month to film and spent about 1 million euros to produce this great film. This proves that not only great productions produce great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG stands for program error that causes reactions in the computer's function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The vertiginous events in this film begin with the death of a BUG. A man witnesses the "crime" on the other side of the road ... From then on everything gets complicated ... <br /> <br /> I point out John Carroll Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who does not can do everything right.
