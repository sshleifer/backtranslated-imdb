I've seen this for 25 years on PBS. It was very difficult to watch. So real. Watching this little family struggle in the winter was a heartbreak. There is no time to court: fate has put us together and we put our shoulders on the ground and make it work. This was based on the actual woman's diary, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was small and all her problems and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. She learned to cut, that she was not like a lady. She feared that no enchanted prince wanted a woman with sun-soaked hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to cut, and she was happy to do so. Both were widowed and worked together to build a new home. It was so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been good. That only makes the tragedy even sadder. I was crying so hard. But then they left and successfully retired a new calf. Spring is on the way and life goes on. In her diary she had two more boys and they lived.
