Well, after much anticipation after seeing some clips in Bravo's film The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I've long waited to see this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a scary movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The acting is good, and there are some really disturbing parts, like the strange orgy scene with the dead father and the plump woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing. The ending is an odd mix of deformed and cannibalistic people. It's very strange, exaggerated, but in the end, I really believe in a great movie! One of my favorites from the 70's, even if it's nothing too original. It's crazy and extremely scary! Probably one of my all time favorites. 9/10
