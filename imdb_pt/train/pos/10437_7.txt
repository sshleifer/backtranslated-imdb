This is a slow story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprises. If you can not see a movie about two people talking and walking, about a story that slowly develops to the end and about the love affair, do not waste time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're into dialogue, masterful storytelling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life, then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you're more alert, because the pace, the music, and the overall tone of the movie can make you anxious. It's truly fantastic. I really mean it. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying at their mannerisms at times, but fortunately, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In your conversations, there are excellent comments on many subjects that provoke thoughts and conversations between you and your partner. I thought it was very deep and very diverse for these young characters, but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still, it did not spoil the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, which I think gives the film its charm and ultimately its power. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The movie stream is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. History is built smoothly, systematically and substantively. The construction to the end is satisfactory and, in the end, rewarding.
