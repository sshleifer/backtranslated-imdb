Loopy, but the astute and formidable Vic Mafia boss (an excellent performance of Richard Dreyfuss) is released from a psychiatric hospital. Several of Vic's fellow criminals include volatile "Brass Balls" Ben London (a glorious, maniacal portrait by Gabriel Byrne), the sarcastic Jake Parker (a perfectly satisfied Kyle MacLachlan) and the vicious rival "Wacky." "Jacky Jackson (a good move by Burt Reynolds) all try to beat Vic. Meanwhile, Mickey Holliday (well played with the discreet confidence of Jeff Goldblum), relaxed and self-assured, finds himself in the midst of all this lethal madness Screenwriter / director Larry Bishop brings an incredibly unique, quirky and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this dark and obscure comedy about betrayal, loyalty and relentless ambition that run dangerously. Ellen Barkin as the intrepid and tough Mita Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic's right confidant Joe Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as the philosophical philosopher Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as the sweet and lovable lover of Vic, Grace, Billy Drago as the viscous Wells, and Christopher Jones as the brutal artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop takes full advantage of his juicy secondary role as the lethal killer and laconic Nick. Appearing in cool chunks are Billy Idol as a rough bandit, Michael J. Pollard as the ill-fated Red, Joey Bishop as funeral agent Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a cheerful driver, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka in "My Way" is a definite highlight. A tense and entertaining Mexican climatiser also pleases the funny bone somewhat hysterical. Frank Byers' chic cinematography, the scandalous and crazy dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy cocktail lounge, and a select soundtrack of golden classics shake the peculiar charm of this immensely fun and unique curiosity.
