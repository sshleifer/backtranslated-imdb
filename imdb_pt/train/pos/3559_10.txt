I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. Frank Sinatra does not have the chance to sing so much in this movie, but it's also good that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie. where he is mainly doing the singing. <br /> <br /> I really thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with that great voice pulling the gangster feel out of his voice. Stubby Kaye, "Sit down, you're shaking the boat" is a song that I love. It's a difficult act to follow with your version and I still like your best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is excellent in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for that part. Maybe I did not consider it first, but after seeing it on paper, it made sense. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it was being staged in the year 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I think often something is lost from the stage version to the movie version, but this has kept the stage feel. , even if it was in the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well released. I introduced myself in regional versions and is one of my favorites of this period.
