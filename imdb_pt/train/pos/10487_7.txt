Saving Grace is a good movie with the heart in the right place. Grace is a widow and realizes that her late husband left her with a lot of debt. She could lose her beautiful home and see no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She is living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the locals are all wonderful people that most viewers would love to have as neighbors. There's just one wrong thing with this photo and it's how it portrays the effect that marijuana has on the user. It is obvious that none of the actors or writers of this film actually smoked the material. The way villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and supposedly funny. It is precisely in these scenes that wit is replaced by the English pie, and that is a pity in a film which is, however, very pleasant.
