It's not one of his most compelling stories, and that's a real force in this movie. There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some too predictable romantic tension. They not only save the public, but also bring some surprises at the same time. There are some Disney moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was well worth the rent and it was good, relaxed fun. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you take the DVD, watch the segment where the director teaches how to do aloo gobi. We followed your directions and it was brilliant! Next time, we'll do it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is a dish that definitely gets better with an entire night in the refrigerator to let the spices out!
