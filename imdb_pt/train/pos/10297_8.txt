Well, not really. This movie is a lot of fun though. I went and saw with the girlfriend last night and had to use the routine "I think there might be something in my eye". The film is a great combination of typical comedy and romance. Jim Carey is superb as a lucky reporter who gets the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact, all the characters are great. The movie is not very funny or sappy, good movie to go see with wife. <br /> <br /> All in All 8/10 .... note * I'm not an easy grader. That's all BigV's over and over!
