My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" from a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the Horror section - none of us had heard of it, but the synopsis in the box was really promising. And the film did not disappoint, although I still did not call it a horror movie exclusively. <br /> <br /> Anna Madden, 11, draws a house and visits her in her dreams. She is definitely sleeping when she is looking at the house, but it is so real that it is almost a completely separate reality. Which, in view of later events, does not seem very far from the truth. Either way, she thinks she can add to the house, its contents and its surroundings, simply by adding to the image. <br /> <br /> As it happens, Anna is getting more and more sick with a fever, and she is becoming totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. In addition, she and her mother are also dealing with the absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long periods, though we have the impression that there is indeed more to the story than that. <br /> <br /> OK, so the drawing material sounds cool enough - but frankly there's something really menacing about it. The dream world is frighteningly surreal - the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a desolate field. The people who made the film did a great job making us very uncomfortable with this alternate / dream world ... One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems be the same patient the doctor is talking about (I will not give it up, you know from the moment he seems to be the same boy). In fact, Mark can not walk because of an illness; in the world of Anna's drawing, he can not walk because she has not attracted him any leg. She blames herself for her real-life illness, and tries to rectify the situation, but ... it all starts to get very strange. She even brings her absent father to the drawing with disastrous results. The pieces with the father are really terrifying. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything, so I'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot going on in this movie. I'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this death thing with your friends after watching ... Is it a simple story as it seems, or are there layers of meaning? I do not know, but it's pretty fascinating anyway. There was a quality "Nightmare On Elm Street", which at one point reality and dreams intersect. I love things like that. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it looks like it could have ended many times, but no. I'm satisfied with the end you've had (some of you sensitive types might want to have Kleenex on hand!), Though you really can have several conclusions. Either way, you do not exactly feel exhausted after it's over, but while you're watching and keep disappearing, it's a little stressful. <br /> <br /> Still, "Paperhouse" is really Good movie. It's well done, and acting - especially Charlotte Burke as Anna - is top notch. Burke, who has never before or since appeared in a movie, is a real gem. I do not know why she never did anything else, but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch. "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / something more kind of movie, with some horrid set bits - but you can still watch it with your family and not to worry that your little brother or your grandmother will be harmed by sneezing blood or something. <br /> <br /> Take a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book too ...
