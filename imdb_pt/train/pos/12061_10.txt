Every once in a while, in the wonderful world of horror, the diamonds are crafted, and one is completely overwhelmed by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond !! This is a film filled with strangeness, creepy anticipation and somber atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say that one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And of course it probably contains the single most flat scary sequence in the entire horror story! Every time I see the movie, and it gets to the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I'm going to be afraid, but it never stops happening; I never understood correctly, and I look as terrified as the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, to scare a tired terror fan so, this is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the English know their subtleties, they pride themselves on the art of acting, they do not need any special effect to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of powerful history and the shiver (in this case) of suggestion and anticipation. Each element is flawless, from sets, acting, history to the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran could certainly make the devil whine for sure !! As a final note, if you for some insane reason do not like this kind of insanity then you honestly do not know what horror is and frankly you do not deserve to know either. Thank you!
