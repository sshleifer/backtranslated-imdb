All the people who sit here and say that the weak link in this movie is that the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was okay, were it not for this annoying cravista. Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. How anyone can watch this and not have fun with Joey Ramone eating bean sprouts behind the scenes in an attempt to keep him in a running condition is obviously a wet blanket. Ms Trogar, blasting white rats, patrol hall ... instant classics. Nevermind the Riff Randell character. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the Ramones then you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
