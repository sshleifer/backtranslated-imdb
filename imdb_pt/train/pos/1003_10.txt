Another Australian masterpiece, this plunges into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and does very well. He does not resort to the great special effect of American movies, but focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple storyline that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. It follows the story of a couple buying an old house that supposedly housed a very old woman who never left home and whose husband disappeared under mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to become the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
