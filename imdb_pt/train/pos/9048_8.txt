I resisted watching this movie and I understood why it was not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" looks and looks so familiar. And this is it. All the inventions and thrills of the plot have been explored before in other films - and possibly even better. But despite its familiarity and resistance to all Hollywood formulas, this film is victorious and enjoyable at every turn. Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters in Steven Sondheim's musical, MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG, stood agape on the roof of the apartment waiting for him to launch his next generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle"), Sputnik has a similar effect on young. rocket boys of this true tale. While tired residents of his 1950 coal city discard the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket to life in the mines. <br /> <br /> Magisterial direction and foundry make the rocket journey Homer and his friends look fresh and new. Especially affecting are subplots relating to Homer's young schoolteacher. Notable restraint is shown in portraying your delicate relationship. Also notable is the father / son supblot who anchors the film. Perfectly threw everything around. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without clich√© or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and warm. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A great chain of videos that I despise has a sign next to this movie saying that you will love this movie or they will refund your money. For the first time, I agree with them. You will never see the October sky again. <br /> <br />
