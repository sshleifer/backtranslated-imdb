My brothers and I came across The Champions when our local station was airing a summer reruns in the 1970s. We love it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual American reruns (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get it). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not surprising since it was also British and in the spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I'd love to see it again now - hopefully it holds up. I mentioned this show to others and no one ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I had imagined their whole existence. But the wonder of the web has allowed me to track information about it. I hope you find a new generation of fans.
