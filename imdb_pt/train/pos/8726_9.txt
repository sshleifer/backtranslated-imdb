Now that's what a family movie should be! There have been few films in recent years that have targeted families or children who really deserve their public hearing; but this is one of them. My entire family left the film, marveling, entertained, dazzled and happy. We are still quoting little anecdotes here and there. The kids LOVED it and so did we (Hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> In addition to its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they are and imaginary as they are). ) are very well developed. There is not one of them that you can not empathize with. The personalities that bring these little creatures to life are well-fused voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of Disney's top animators. This is a movie worthy of Walt Disney. I think Mr. Disney would approve this new movie ... Flick, Dot and his band of little heroes can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is one of the families leaving the theater wanting to see again .. and buy to own in video or DVD. I look forward to seeing again .. to catch what I might have missed the first time. (I've never seen my kids so fast and vividly identify themselves and embrace characters before ... my daughter is still talking about the little Dot.) This movie is funny, exciting, clever and great. Fun for the whole family!
