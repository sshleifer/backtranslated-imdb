I remember watching it on TV in the late 70's - and stayed with me! It's charming, tall, colorful - a great kid's movie. I put it on for some friends at a party recently - and of course they thought I was angry and hoped something bad would happen to the "Meet the weak" dolls. But no - their clean, healthy fun. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is in good shape, just like Mama Cass, and the Witch Poo is somehow attractive. <br /> <br /> If you like banana splits and you are in your 30's this will recreate this surreal childhood on a Saturday morning vibe! <br /> <br /> Even if I realized now that Puf himself is crap - how all he does is get caught and get away! Movie quality for TV - if, like me, you like death metal - you'll love it!
