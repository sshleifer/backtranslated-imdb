From the opening scenes of the lead actor, we are given an early vision of how so many lives of men are directed by women in them, and the humor that comes through everything that happens in the day to day of "normal" life. Eric Lartigau, the director, shows how many European men feel they are in total control of their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them, this does not seem to make things work. . The use of the facial image throughout the film is superb, and its intelligent positioning of the senior member of the family (mother) is very visible. <br /> <br /> Although there is more than enough laughter in the film, it still deals with single parents / adoptions and the strength of family in society. Truly rewarding to watch, and again one that only French sewing capable of doing. <br /> <br /> So far, one of the top 50 or so movies I've seen this year, and it's worth a top five rating. I'm looking forward to adding this to the DVD collection when it's released and I recommend it for all ages.
