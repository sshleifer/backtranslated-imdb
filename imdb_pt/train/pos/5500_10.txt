This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone should see this. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected in an overwhelming vote in 1998. His platform was to divert the fantastic wealth of oil from the 20 percent of the middle class to the poor 80 percent. He banned foreign drift net fishing in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the favelas to treat the sick for free. It eliminated illiteracy and created new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30 percent tax on profits from oil companies that put him in trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were interviewing Chavez inside the Presidential Palace on their social programs, a CIA-backed coup was launched. With the cameras running, Chavez was captured and taken out of the country. It was announced on national TV that he had "resigned." <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela did not believe in the media. They went to the palace in the millions and demanded that Ch√°vez be returned. Faced with such impressive numbers, the military attacked the coup leaders and the conspirators fled to the United States. Chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation.
