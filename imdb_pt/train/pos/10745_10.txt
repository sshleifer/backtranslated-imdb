Let me take the bad of the first way, James Hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act on his descriptions of what was happening with the novice training and the events of the day. It really is in austere contract for the other firefighters without acting aspirations that are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> Said this is an amazing movie that it is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes. I am an English guy from London, but I love New York and have visited many times before and after 9/11. It's a second home for me and I can not help feeling devastated by the loss of lives, but also by destroying part of such an incredible city. This is the real deal with the firefighters with everything in collapse around them. I am so happy that the footage exists to show people how it was in the day. It's a shame they did not use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because the friends who were there told me that this is an important part of their memory, which should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell.
