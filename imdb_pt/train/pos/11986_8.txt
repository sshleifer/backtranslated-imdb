I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was o.k., but missing something. Maybe Buster Keaton, strangely speaking, threw me out, or the forced delivery line of a protagonist. The next day, I kept thinking about the movie. I could not get the song of Durante out of my head, I kept trying to remember Thelma Todd's first scene better, I considered that Keaton might have made some funny falls and physical comedy. The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving showgirl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with their sex appeal. A very funny scene, the excellent actors, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. So I watched another scene, their show is opening on Broadway. Buster in his happy innocence fails in all acts. Once again, I was laughing out loud, enjoying Keaton's antics and motions. So the next night, I watched the movie all over again, and this time I saw it for the first time: it's great! That's awesome! It's sublime! Three great comedians! Todd dances! During sings! Keaton talks! Of course it's not poifect ... but there are lots of laughs in this photo.
