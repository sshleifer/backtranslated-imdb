Although John Woo's Hard Boiled is my number one favorite movie. But I have to say that police history is my number two favorite movie. I say this because the stunts, fights and action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs a post surrounded with Chrismas lights and slid down the post fell through a skylight and finally landing on his back on the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in 14 dollars.) VHS new line home video. Any questions or comments, please feel free to reply. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie already made.) If you're looking everywhere for a movie and can not find it, please respond to me. Thank you and good night!
