I really like this movie. It has a wonderful chemistry among the actors and tells a story that is quite universal, the story of the prodigal son. The thing I like the most is the way the bathroom was more than just a backdrop to the story. While the father told his son the story of his wife's family in the deserts of northern China, the element of water and bath becomes an almost sacred ritual. The water was so scarce that a simple bath had deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was very effective. There were times, however, when it bordered on the "very" sweet ... bordered by the scene during the scene of the park's recital. But overall, I highly recommend this movie.
