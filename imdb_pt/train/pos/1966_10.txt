I'm not a regular commentator on this site, but seeing how this movie is underestimated, I strive to write some comments and remarks about it. I had fun watching this movie, maybe because Cat is everything I'd like to be, I'm not going to post spoilers or reveal plots, but there are things I've really found incredible, the way she manipulates people is so divine. this is a very underrated movie, I lack arguments here, I usually enjoy it and then I say little about it, when you go to the movies it is fun, and I really enjoyed the 1h53 I stayed in the dark room. one must be seen over and over again until the delight disappears. let's try not to be so critical about it. thanks for reading.
