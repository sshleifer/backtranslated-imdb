I would not go so far as not to recommend this film, since the only problems I have with it are due to overexposure to the plotting devices used in the film - the kind of things common to all children's films of all times. This does not hurt, but it's not something I go far for. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of saccharine so I can say that most of the time anyone looking for something with a little more intelligence could be disappointed in a movie obviously for kids like this. <br /> <br /> However, all of this comes out the window when the squirrel (the one in all trailers) appears on the screen. Their time is limited, but it seems clear that decision-makers had the wisdom to say to these guys, "Hey, could you have a little more squirrel?" every time it's getting unbearably boring. That does not save the movie, but you can come out saying "at least there was one aspect where I could not stop laughing". <br /> <br /> And of course, visually will not disappoint, but it's almost a given with the Pixar movies. Of all your things, I'd put this down ... but that's not bad.
