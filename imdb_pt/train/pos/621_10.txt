As a big fan of fantasy in general, and the works of Neil Gaiman * in particular *, I have been eagerly waiting for this film so eagerly, so hungry and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of deception that I can barely believe finally be here. And you know what? I should not have feared, the movie version is incredible. Unlike the book, but in a good way - less capricious, more comical, still deeply sweet and charming. <br /> <br /> Special effects are absolutely perfect, and make magic seem like a natural and appropriate part of the book. the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive. <br /> <br /> Due attention was paid to storytelling and rhythm, and the main cast is a triumph, with the ghostly Princes (whose interpretation almost reads like "Who's Who" from the now-cool British comedy - Rupert Everett , David Walliams of Little Britain, two of the guys from Green Wing, etc.) stealing most of the best lines and practically all the funniest moments in the movies, which exist in abundance. <br /> <br /> In fact, the smallest criticism I have throughout the film is that sometimes the elements of comedy become a bit OTT, the subtlety comes out of the window at the expense of the main story .... cameo by Ricky Gervais, for example, was much more than "Ricky Gervais doing the usual David Brent of the Office comedy persona" to my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwanted and bumpy break from the magic spell of progressive history (although, in fact, from memory I believe the character of Ferdy in the original book was very "Ricky Gervais" -squire when I think about it). <br /> <br /> But this is a small complaint one otherwise fairy tale cast and scriptted with a good mix of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist Tristan, captures the right mix of naivety, subtle comedy and self-actualization necessary for a story like this, in which a "humble young boy embarks on a quest to change his life"; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, moody and just a little alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her starring role; Robert De Niro, the point every reviewer is talking about, is really praiseworthy, entertaining (he seems to be having a ball too) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and unpleasant as Lamia, my favorite movie performance in general . If you liked her deliciously performance in the recent "Hairspray" then you will enjoy it in this, too. <br /> <br /> So to finish this comment: you will laugh, sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful and moving fairy tale for the whole family, with a heart of gold and smarter than it is immediately apparent. One of my all-time favorite movies is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is being promptly compared to this with good reason as it's a very similar type of movie exploring similar themes and territories ... and just like The Princess Bride remains fresh, intelligent and funny twenty years after its initial release, I believe Stardust Sweetness will be appearing as a family favorite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) For many years to come.
