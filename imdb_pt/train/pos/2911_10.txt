This is one of the best music concerts anyone has ever seen and heard. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was new and hearing it again today by the original artist today is a measure of the power of Sir P Mc to bewitch any crowd of any age. This documentary goes way beyond the wings to show us life on the road not just to the band, but to all the roadies. I saw this guy live on Aussie 1975 and I can guarantee that his performance here on this DVD is not less than he gave almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does it justice and would recommend this someone especially a fan of the Beatles. This is the closest you will get to a Beatles show today. Singer, composer, lead / rhythm / bass, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few artists who can stand alone with an instrument and hold the crowd in hand. If you want to listen to perfect music, buy a CD recorded in a studio. If you want to listen to raw music as it is intentional and spontaneous to the crowd, with all the excitement and excitement of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
