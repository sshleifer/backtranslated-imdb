Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for fans of zombies with a true love for the Horror genre. From what I understood from the commentary and the things I read, it was done during the great Midwest flood of 1993, when half of Missouri was underwater. Buildings were under water. cars and houses were underwater. One article said that the zombies and the film crew would help console the river after filming each day. The fact that this movie was made is a miracle. It's like a huge mix of all the zombie movies ever made through a Troma filter. It's a party movie to enjoy with friends who like a lot of splatter and goofy characters. And he's fast and energetic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A toxic spill accident at a nuclear power facility causes people to melt or turn into zombies. The local government masks the factory and builds houses on it. Some land shifts (?) Cause a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and release the undead into the newly constructed community. From there, everything goes crazy, bloody and fun. <br /> <br /> I have read these reviews here a few times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun movie three times as a different reviewer using fake names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. It has some bad acting. So half the movies are made. There is much much worse out there than this fun movie. If you hate this film so much, do not buy it. No need for personal attacks and to call the crew or launch "Trailer Trash". And it's obvious you're not from Australia or England. It's just disturbing that this great service, the IMDb does not catch people using just to destroy others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not care about that. I myself give good and bad evaluations. But it's painfully obvious that some idiot just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "Reviewers" even basically process their "criticism" just to promote their own films. One called this movie "boring" - well, love it or hate it, one thing you can never say about this movie is that it's boring. It moves fast and never has a boring spot. <br /> <br /> Oh and this reviewer from Holland? One - LIAR. You tried to post this same comment on Amazon and it was ripped off there. The SAME review only said it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense has to stop. Love or hate - take a real review or enter anything. It's obvious you have not seen the movies. <br /> <br /> But to be sure, I have and although this is not the best I have seen, it is far from the worst. And even the worst I would give a real REVOEW and would not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> I hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity that is happening here.
