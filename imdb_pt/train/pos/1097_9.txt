I stopped before giving "Mr. Blandings builds his dream home" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century shrink a little: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But in addition, the film is a joke. Portraying middle-class New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a house in Connecticut, this movie has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual irreverent humor, while Loy does very well as merely a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughter like Jim and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear. As for the house itself ... for most of the film, you will probably feel ambiguous about whether or not you want to live there. Builders, contractors and others also provide their fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, a comedy classic. Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
