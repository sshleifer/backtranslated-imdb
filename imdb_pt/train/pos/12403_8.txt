You would be forgiven for thinking that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing an American horror film (especially one located entirely inside a US prison) - see this to prove it wrong! It was produced in the '80s, and the film was made with a more appropriate budget for a DIY TV ad (something I think anyone would really notice nowadays, with virtually everyone accustomed to $ 100 million + budgets for industry minded action films!) being the first major production of Mr. Harlin and - at least what would now be considered a stellar cast. I still think that most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole has more to do with the appearances of Stellan Stargaard (not to mention Bergman's well-overdressed management efforts) - at least for all women - but this film really It proves that there is a good movie talent outside the US and Hollywood to make us watch a thriller. Try watching this movie even if you're not a puff of terror, IMO, it's definitely worth it!
