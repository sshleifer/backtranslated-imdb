"One shot, one kill, no exceptions." A must see if you are in the Marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! Great overall plot, great camera work, good drama, action, detail and more. Very close to the real thing. But this is not a movie to break and choose editing flaws. this is to sit and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this movie is not really about making you think. it's about enjoying the sniper's lifestyle and action. sniper 2 and 3 are very good accompaniments, but the first one is still the best movie in general. Tom Berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the shooter's life. the plain to deal with all death. Must see for the sniper fans.
