"Atlantis" is a new and right step for a Disney resort. It's a good choice to make a movie with a legend as mysterious as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this movie, but after watching it, I did not quite understand why this movie received such bad reviews. Even in my country, the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of the biggest in Disney, even though I doubt that this movie achieves the reputation of "Disney Classic." Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this science fiction movie was directed by the same directors as "The Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from the reputation of their monster movies, he, I) playing. <br /> Well, silly enough. "Atlantis" is an entertaining, thrilling and very enjoyable film. Even this movie is a PG-rated action feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who want to say otherwise, do not kill me for writing this, it). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it does not spoil the movie. The comic-inspired animation is suitable for the movie and the set is a departure from the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. The sequences of the Deep Canvas are quite impressive. The movie is also funny at times, even I laughed more than laughed through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters in this movie are also very friendly, but unfortunately there is not enough screen time to meet everyone, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It is bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive about this movie is how they are making the language of Atlantis sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really amazing (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is well written and well written, but there are still some unanswered questions in the story. But fortunately, there is not much of them. <br /> <br /> So, you're a favor to yourself, do not listen to critics and watch "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
