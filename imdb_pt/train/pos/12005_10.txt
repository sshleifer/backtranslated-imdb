This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Being SUD I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film has not been made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and life-changing film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by all. I saw this movie with my family and I can testify that we all had a change of heart. This movie allows people to really understand how hard life was for the prophet and how much trouble he came across. After I saw this movie, there was not a single dry eye across the room. Everyone was moved by what they saw and I have not been the same since I saw him. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
