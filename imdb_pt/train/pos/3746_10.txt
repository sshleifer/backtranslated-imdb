I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is awesome! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells "SPOONS!" I crawl every time. I would recommend this movie to fans of Knox Klaymation and to people who like the other Jason Steele movies. His style of animation is very original. Some views are required to view the detailed backgrounds. Your mood is also hilarious and definitely not something you'd hear before. Like Max, the deformed spatula that has a sound system and light in his head radiates colorful lights and cheerful music whenever he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime anywhere.
