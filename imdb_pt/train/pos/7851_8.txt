The Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject (adultery) or because it's lively (Winsor McCay had introduced Little Nemo in the movie by this time), but because it portrays bugs to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to shoot real fighting insects but failed to make them on camera because of the hot lights they suffered, so he caught the dead and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate the movements to their satisfaction. This short does a good job of putting human characteristics in small creatures like riding a motorcycle, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also do Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work would be this. If you're interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, check out your local library to borrow the The Cameraman't Revenge and Other Fantastic Tales from Image Entertainment.
