I was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary, and waited a long time for this to come through the pipes (my local video chain), and it was well worth the wait. I like a good documentary / piece of special interest, but this was definitely sincere, honest and nostalgic, if you want, look at teenage life. A child's imagination is fascinating and that is where a great story begins. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, fun and entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and the company have definitely come a long way from video calling productions in the banking hold-ups neighborhoods, and gay rings that make gay people all at once. Everyone seems quite successful in their respectful fields, and it is good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD has a few extra trailers for other good documentaries, and features a number of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
