"Holly" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. In the background, it is a character-driven film that would not be so successful without the portraits of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the awareness that gradually awakens, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), with willpower, but ultimately outperformed the young Vietnamese girl. From vibrant places and photography to effective editing, everything is straightforward and well done. The contemporary classical score may put some in the beginning, but it is a high-level composition and underscores the admirable restraint that is evident everywhere. This film, which raises many questions but provides few clear answers, ultimately manages to raise awareness and compassion for Holly and the many who share her situation. Lots of compliments to those who have managed to do this.
