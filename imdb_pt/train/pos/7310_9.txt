There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films of all time, not only in its genre but also overseas. I love the scary atmosphere films like the whole that could happen here kind of situation makes it so creepy thinking. Besides imagining If you've ever been in this situation, what would you do. This is a movie that I like to watch a lot, especially around Halloween time. John Carpenter is a very professional director I love many of his other films, but there is no doubt that his most famous film is the movie Halloween.Oh and if you are thinking of watching the remake of Rob Zombie, do not. It sucks and a true Halloween fan would like John Carpenter's 1978 version to be better. Michael Myers is one of the coolest Slasher killers. in any film, and is well known. So, please see this masterpiece that you really will like.
