I look at this page, and I seem to disapprove of having to hear someone yapping and complaining about a real classic. Of course, I agree to let everyone have their say, but here's mine: This movie should not be missed by any classical horror watchers, and should be seen by many casual viewers around the world . Of course, he has lost some of his talent and greatness with age, especially in the current world of CGI effects, but that's not why you should like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it's really a horror movie. , even by today's standards. In general, ickyness will scare you as much as the original audience, so do not hit a classic if you have not given it a chance. Watch, but not with a critical attitude. Watch for fun as originally planned.
