I just saw this Japanese movie at the 5th Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival at the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this English-language film has its ballroom dancing as its heart, the film really shows the world outside of Japan how rigid structures of family, employment (salaried) and recreation still exist in the Modern Japan. Writer / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting the family name (last name) first and the given name (last)] uses the not so popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [In addition, I will not use the names of the characters in the movie when the world's readers are unfamiliar with the Japanese formal names that may be confused. I will refer to the actors by his professional acting name as listed in the Internet Data Base.] <br /> <br /> He asks the help of his wife in real life, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his first and, so far, only film. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. However, her true ambition is to compete once again in an International Dance Competition, of which she has been disqualified in the past. No, I will not say "why". Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. A veteran of about 25 films since 1979, he gives an excellent performance of a 40-year-old businessman who has a beautiful wife, teenage daughter, and has just bought his father's house. <br /> <br />> longing. <br /> <br /> And yet, something is lacking in your own inner happiness. Watch this movie to learn how it becomes "involved" with ballroom dancing and secretly goes to the lessons of <br />. Most of the dancing characters are freed from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure. They are friendly, welcoming and inviting. Of course, this is in stark contrast to how Japanese society is structured with its philosophy "place for everyone and everyone in its place". <br /> <br /> The film has so many funny moments. The nearly 1,500 spectators of the theater broke into spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments. This proves that the comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant, just like Watanabe Eriko. They are two funny character actors. <br /> <br /> We could buy and read a college textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or, you could watch this movie and begin to understand how people <br /> grow in a rather rigid social structure. Watching the movie "Vamos Dansu?" is a quick immersion in later studies and in the viewing of other Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's lovely, it'll make you cry a little and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
