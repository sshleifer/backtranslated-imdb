I was impressed with the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and made me cry on more than one occasion. A science fiction fan, I like to think I can pick the good stuff from BS, and that was good. As such, when I first heard about the prospect of a prequel series a few months ago I had a sick feeling in my gut. I feared that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which would not work. The story of BSG, a sad group of survivors, trapped in decadent starships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where the BSG occurs after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays this civilization in its cold and decaying heyday. The general vibration I received from Caprica was similar to that of the Minority Report, minus the excessive and counterproductive theatrics. In true BSG form, Caprica has in his early hours of programming already addressed the issues of religious freedom, racism, the playful morality of God and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The cast for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and profound, from the obsessive and distant scientist who became an entrepreneur, to his troubled and willful daughter, every actor and actress throws himself into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music, which was used so powerfully in BSG, also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and sad duduks served the subjects very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show the feeling of being very different from any of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely a show of its own, taking away the Battlestar franchise just the way it is. I look forward to the complete series.
