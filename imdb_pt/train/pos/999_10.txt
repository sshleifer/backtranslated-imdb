I'm amazed at the way this movie (and most of the others have an average of 5 stars and lower when there are low quality movies on average 7 to 10 stars in the IMDb The Fanboy mentality strikes again.When this movie left almost everyone beat ex-girlfriend said this questionable film.Previously I sat to watch this movie and I saw myself enjoying.I laugh a little.This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling director Antoine Fuqua as black Michael Bay I do not see how once most Fuqua movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay invented. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is an ex-convict who is used by a treasury agent Edgar (David Morse) as a pawn to pick up a killer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson). Every move by Alvin is traced by a bug implanted in his jaw following an accident. While this es agents are behind Bristol, Bristol is after the golden bricks that were taken in an assault that went wrong <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is as fun as excellent as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a quick talker who is much smarter than he lets it show. Doug Hutchinson is just like Bristol. He may be over-the-top sometimes in his behavior John Malkovitchesque. He was better here than as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the agent of the Treasury. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother, Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the movie is that some of the suspense attempts fall by surprise. The scenery on the horse race track is very exaggerated, but I could not look away. The director has been all out there so he earns points for it. In addition, the scene of the bomb with the treasure agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests in the door was very nice. <br /> <br /> In short, Bait is not a bad movie. It's never boring, it's always funny and I was not checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Isca is one of the most underrated films of the 2000 period. PS: for the critic who claimed that this film is very violent ... How long have you lived under a rock? I'm sure you've seen the Die Hard series and all the Quentin Tarantino movies. But these films are not violent, right? Weird.
