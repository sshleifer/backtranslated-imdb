OH WOW I saw this movie at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available for questions afterwards. What a beautiful movie! Although established in Ireland amidst Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people let go when given the opportunity to vent their hatred and anger was beautifully woven with a moving love story showered with humor and fun. If this is not picked up in the US, it will be really regrettable. <br /> <br /> As for stars and supporting players ... FIRST RATE. They call me Orla Brady, the Irish Meryl Streep, I hear. It's my opinion she's better than Meryl Streep. They should be calling Meryl, the American Orla Brady! And the constant and powerful portrait of Liam Cunningham, of a simple, private man involved in a political war, was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS MOVIE.
