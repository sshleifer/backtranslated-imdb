This is a wonderful film. The non-stop standard takes several watchings to fully appreciate. Busby Berkeley's music productions will never be duplicated. I think this film easily outweighs all your other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are amazing together. Some of the humor would almost push the limits of today's movies. Put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy for the show that it is.
