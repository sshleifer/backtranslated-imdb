This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First, many of the action sequences really are not much fun. The first armed battle that occurs in the movie was just silly. Not cool silly, or even silly funny, but just silly. This is not to say that there are no great action scenes, but most simply do not reach the level of some of the other films I've seen. The opposite is that this movie really has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the bad guy in the head, which is flat like a pool table) and most are pretty well represented. All the protagonists of this movie are fun to watch. The dialogue is very witty and does not seem to lose much in translation. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope the non-beginner American audience does not think this is the best that HK has to offer.
