Several posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long and complex dramas. Crime is essentially banal, so the payoff is always anticlimactic, while detailed exposure diminishes the human drama. The writer used a number of smart devices to try to work around this, but was not entirely successful. Answers to precisely what happened and why it might have been provided, but if so they are well buried. The viewer is inevitably a little mistaken. <br /> <br /> But in a sense, that's not important. The drama has never been about crime, or even about the investigation, was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such, it was exciting. The writing was a significant cut above the runtime of the mill for prime-time drama, and evenly good performances. In a group play, it is unfair to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother-wife-daughter, and Janet McTeer was in her broken form as an old tough cop. <BR> One of the most interesting aspects of drama is the manipulation of the race, like the elephant in the room that no one is prepared to mention. Subtle and powerful things.
