Mrs. Patty Duke's story about her life and the struggles with manic depression were like the struggles of my life. I saw myself acting just like her. I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse we both suffered as children. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it first debuted in 1990 and I loved this movie a lot. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from that movie. It does not matter if you showed your prizes or what they were. That's not the problem here. The question is how Ms Duke had an illness and struggled to survive and excelled. Mrs. Duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments as she struggles to survive a disease that often leaves many victims hopeless. <br /> <br /> Unless a person has fought this disease personally, she does not know the hell they have to live. The film for me was a success because it showed real problems and how a person who is depressed and manic acts. It was so real ... so real. It was like seeing me upstairs on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to personally thank Mrs. Patty Duke for having the courage to inform the public about her illness. Bocka
