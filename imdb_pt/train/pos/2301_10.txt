Really ... and incredible movie that although it is not very popular ... extremely touching and almost life changing ... was for me at least. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my list of favorite movies .... it's number one now .... <br /> <br /> This is a very touching movie that all people should see .. <br /> <br /> The Man on the Moon ..... we are simply amazing. It is now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I recommend it to anyone over 15 as long as you are mature ... If you do not try to feel the emotions of the characters then you ll never get the true meaning and value of this movie .... But it's really amazing .... just watch it because it will change the way some people look at life .... worth seeing 5/5
