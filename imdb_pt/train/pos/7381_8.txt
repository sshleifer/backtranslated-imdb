IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners of a company along with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the former hire a professional assassin, ANISIO, to assassinate ESTEVÃO (the plot, at least at the beginning, does not t explain very good because). The guy does this and after getting his money, he starts blackmailing the two partners, showing up at his company and saying that he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something ??). At the same time, he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVÃO, and begins to date her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be victimized, with the exception of MARINA, who is the only person who Do not do that. Do you know what's going on and not betray anyone? <br /> <br /> The film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality that exists in big metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is an everyday presence. We can feel irony, but also veracity in characters such as ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), who blackmails the guys who paid him without any scruples, and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed! He really should be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him out there in Brazil or anywhere else? <br /> <br /> Is it a very good movie, cruel but sincere, about a sad reality? The acting is great and the soundtrack too.
