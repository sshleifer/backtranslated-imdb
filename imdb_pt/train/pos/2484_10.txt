Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda drove Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one to get it right. <br /> <br /> This is the only "Hamlet" movie that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story. Few directors can do this without upsetting the public, but the skilful use of Branagh's brave movie style and stunt allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut. Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose goal was simply to say "yes, my lord," while Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the gravedigger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as the actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh's performance in scene 4 of the 4th soliloquy (which is again usually cut out) is nothing less than a cinematic wonder, as the camera slowly pulls away as the intensity increases. It's a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start clapping. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understood the importance of each scene in the film and knew how to convey that importance. for the general public. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for everyone who likes good story telling, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All these parts of William Shakespeares' triumph.
