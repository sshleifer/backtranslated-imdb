Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent era. This gives you a chance to showcase these talents in a little history of time travel. He gets connected with a guy who lives in modern times, and it becomes obvious that we should leave it in our own times. Keaton is able to make his jokes with vision very well. I've heard his voice before. I believe he made some of those Beach Party movies by playing some empty characters just to earn some change. Serling seemed to respect him and portrayed him that way. It's not a bad story. It shows how someone reacts when we want something we do not have and we get that desire.
