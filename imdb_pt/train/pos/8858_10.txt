I must admit that this is the kind of movie I usually avoided, but I rented it basically because of the stars. I certainly did not regret it. In fact, as you can see, I rated five stars. This film is the perfect combination of sharp steering and superior acting. Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the gross crime of stealing their parents' jewelry store. The crime goes terribly wrong - thus initiating an examination of the three men of the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we met Charles Hanson and came to an understanding of the tense relationship between father and children. <br /> <br /> Little brother, Hank is basically bullshit. He's always had trouble keeping a job and practically heading in the wind. Hank is insecure, cowardly and greatly influenced by his older brother. Ethan Hawke has Hank's character "nailed to a T" and gives what is probably his best performance so far. He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by external forces that he is unable to perform any important task. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - seems to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has strayed from his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who invents the scheme to steal his parents' store, and he gets Hank weak will to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - certainly one of the best actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman who his friends know but a real ball of mud underneath. He is absolutely perfect for the role of Andy, or it can be said that he, through his superior acting skills, made Andy the perfect role. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad man or insensitive, but he has a bad relationship with his children because he never understood what was necessary to create a positive bond between his children and himself. He was always too quick to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his eldest, causing a great emotional split between him and Andy. As we meet Charles and Andy, Andy's thought forming a plan to steal from his father becomes less unbelievable. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of myself. father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed the movie so much as the story of a distant and critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother who came so close to home. Luckily, my brother and I never got to the state of committing a crime against my parents - I think we were made of smarter, more moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex of personalities and deeds was skillfully mounted by director, Sidney Lumet. At age eighty-three, he still has the cutlets to give the audience captivating characters and cutting-edge hypnotizing action. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years before Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, but he has lost nothing of his magical touch in showing us characters that will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead are tough and unattractive, and this is definitely not a well-being movie. However, it's two hours of ultimate entertainment that I thoroughly recommend.
