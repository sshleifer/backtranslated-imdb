This movie won each of the ten votes I gave! Thank you guys for making a movie worth watching. You've shown the world, you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes. The poetry was also incredible, for the poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched it last night, when I fell in love with my sweetheart again. I will add it to my movie collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about quantity .... <br /> <Thank you again and best wishes and blessings to you!
