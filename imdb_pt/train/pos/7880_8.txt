The plot of this fun MGM musical is invented and only occasionally entertaining, dealing with espionage and romance, but the film's focus is duly pointed to the melodious interludes showing the enormously talented and athletic sneaker Eleanor Powell, backed by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra. , with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the best billing with Powell, and he and Helper Bert Lahr receive most of the comedic minutes, though Skelton is most effective when, it may be believed, he presents himself as Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien's movie humor as the dancer's companion. Powell's technical brilliance is evidenced during an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich contributes his percussion skills, and that must be seen several times to allow one's breathing to reach its precision. Director Edward Buzzell uses his large cast well to take action forward, despite the disjointed script with which he must deal, and allows Powell's cotangent impossibilities to govern the subject, as appropriate.
