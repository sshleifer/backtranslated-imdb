I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool soldier who does not want to be bullied and does not want to go to war. His persona is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, is not defined in a war zone, but in a pre-war training of combat preparation. This wonderful film is about the unhealthy perception that the Vietnam War was a mistake and those men who were bound to be sacrificed for a lost cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who showed how very genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier how he disdained and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him. Bozz is totally cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking his military superiors, getting his goat at every opportunity. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree of psychology, "saving" his fellow soldiers and showing those in genuine need, the exit of this man's army. <br /> <br /> The acting and acting are crisp and believable and as a "Sleeper", Tigerland falls with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the top three films in Vietnam in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, a top choice.
