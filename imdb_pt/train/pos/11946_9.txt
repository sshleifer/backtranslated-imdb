*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Shortly after his work with Johansson on Match Point, the two return to "Scoop," a comical ride from Corky, crazy and fun. When a student reporter (Johansson) discovers a new hole from a deceased reporter (McShane) when she enters the materializer of a lame magician (Allen). The novelty is the new killer of the Tarot Card in London, which may be preppy Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid are playing Detective Sondra falls in love with the beautiful would be killer. Allen finally hit a mark, not as good as "Match Point", but definitely more fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected, one of the years should see
