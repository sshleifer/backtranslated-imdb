What a fun movie b! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow is distinctive and original. It really brought me back to the 80's monsters. The budget is obviously low and not everyone is Pacino behind the lenses, but that does not matter because you're never taken seriously. From the junkie trailer to the high flying martial arts movements of the Scarecrow, this is truly a gem of film b. Grab some drinks, snacks and some friends and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought all 3 Scarecrow movies. Of course, they are not for everyone, but for all their. Sometimes you just have to put the hat down and smile.
