This was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good just sit back and watch and have fun. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely does not deserve one, but I thought it was very good. It's like the show 24, but put in the movie format. If you like the whole we have to stop the terrorist from killing the president's type of movie, then you will enjoy this movie. I personally think the plot has been done too much, but Sentinel adds some distortion to the mole in the Secret Service. All in all, this movie will not leave your jaw on the floor or change your life, but who says that every movie has to be like this to be good?
