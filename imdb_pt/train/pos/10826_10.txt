I rarely left watching a movie with such a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I had gone out with very good friends and had a lot of fun! I liked this movie. The acting was superb, though I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular as giving absolutely flawless performance. Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and always love to see them because they perform so solidly. And Billy Connolly, as always, totally handsome. It was a wonderful performance for everyone involved. Such a refreshing experience to see a well-written, superbly represented and good-looking movie.
