The silent film The Pride of the Clan, starring Mary Pickford, was set on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the outside shots were filmed at Marblehead Massachusett, Marblehead Neck, near several seashore rocky areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was because of two factors: 1) the location of the movie Marblehead in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a replacement for Mary Pickford during the filming of various scenes, including the "cliff scene". Both women were small (5 ') in stature, and both my father and grandmother reported the fact that she was a backup with the camera to the cliff scene as part of the set of footage of Chiefton. I just wanted to tell this story to future historians and movie fans. The film itself (my copy on DVD is a bit bad) is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting, including several scenes in which Ms. Pickford portrays a strong female characterization. I liked it and would like to have a better copy of it, although I'm not sure if there are any of them, as I've seen on several movie sites, that the remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. A very cool movie of the silent genre with lots of action!
