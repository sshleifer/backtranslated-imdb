I have not read the other reviews about the movie, but judging by the average rating, I see that they are unlikely to be very complimentary. <br /> <br /> I attended the second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. It's true the adults did not roll on the floor, but the sound of the children's amusement made it look like it. <br /> <br /> It is a true farce of Mel Brooks, with a lot of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are and how inconsistent our friends and associates are. There are many other films on a similar subject, undoubtedly many of which will have a greater comedic or emotional impact on adults. It is hard for me to imagine such a big impact on the younger members of the family. <br /> <br /> Then, for the children, a 9/10 of me.
