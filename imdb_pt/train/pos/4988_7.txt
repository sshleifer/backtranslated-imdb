Man's Castle sits in one of these settlements built on vacant lots and parks that during those times were called "Hoovervilles," in honor of our unfortunate 31st president who was trapped in the Great Depression that occurred in his administration. The proposition of this film is that a man's house is still his castle, even when it is just a cabin in a Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a cabin and truth be told that this guy, even in the good old days, would not be working that much. But in a very typical part for Tracy before he is cast as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of a series of classic roles, he is playing a hard and good mug that takes Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> Of the things about the Castle of Man is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men. Women had some additional tensions, if men had difficulty finding work, women would do it twice as much. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who is facing this type of problem and does not make demands on her in his castle. Pretty soon they're in love, though Tracy is not the type to calm down. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had something extra for them, because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the filming of Man's. Castle. And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith very seriously. Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole field, Marjorie Rambeau who has gone through all the traps Young can find and tries to guide her and Arthur Hohl, an idiot really disgusting fellow who is also eyeing Young. Hohl brings the plot of the Castle of Man to its climax through his intrigues. <br /> <br /> The Castle of Man is a grim look at the Great Depression, not the usual escapist movie for those who try to avoid this kind of reality in their entertainment.
