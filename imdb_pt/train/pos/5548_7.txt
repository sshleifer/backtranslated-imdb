Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with their two favorite cameramen and assistant editor Clarence Brown - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of isolated and poor Scottish islanders - the same territory that Michael Powell would bet twenty years later on for his first big success. Visions of wind and waves, silhouettes of cloaked lovers do not only complement history, they are the story of struggle against difficulties. <br /> <br /> Actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and Pickford is brilliant as his character struggles with his duties as clan chief, swinging between comedy and consideration, here with his father's whip attacking rebellious islanders to the church, sitting there with her guest's cane in her hand like a scepter, discussing her lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose future star Leatrice Joy as a whole. I tried, but I failed.
