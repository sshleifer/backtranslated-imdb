The case of the Scorpion's tail is a highly stylized giallo led by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a giallo master who only loses to Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, quite complex, but at the end of the day. very satisfying and fun mystery of murder. It also makes sense in the end, a great advantage, because it is not always the case of these giallo, since they tend to increase credibility with its endless details and definitive solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The trademarks of the giallo here are beautiful cinematography, captivating soundtrack, beautiful females (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, gloomy killers and sexually explicit scenes, to name a few . <br /> <br /> Most of the time, it is decently represented, Goerge Hilton, its usually smooth, and the others do quite well. Martino drives with a safe hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some fantastic pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a giallo fan, this is a must see. If you like well written thrillers and suspense in general, this is highly recommended.
