Before commenting on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this movie, I expected the typical crap, horror, movie B and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers, but is actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in being psycho in big movies if he has the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through a stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as the snowman starts to move and kill people, you will find it difficult not to laugh. The lines that are said are completely retarded, but very funny. The fact that the rest of the cast completely outshines the film's stupidity, but stupidity is great. The scene in which the snowman is with the teenager is truly classic in B movies and horror movies. I really hope there's a sequel and I'll be there to watch it on any cable channel. Of course it's fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good work of cinematic technology, but I just like watching snowmen killing people. I gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples at dawn.
