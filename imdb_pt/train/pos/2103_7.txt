I'm not aware of "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? I do not really know), but I have to admit, hearing about an agent / hero movie, I expected something quite different, that I really have. <br /> <br /> Although it was surprising to see this in the beginning, it was good to see this movement. You could never really tell where you would go (some twists are predictable, but in general, you can never really tell if they would end up happening). A more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good supporting cast, make this a nice watch. It's not as action-packed as some might expect or expect for a movie like this, but a very good mix.
