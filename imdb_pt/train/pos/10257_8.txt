What can I say about this movie that has not been said yet? Well, to tell you the truth a lot of it seems very fake as some of the tapas and the kicks. like charlie sheen although this was real I do not know. I'm sure they would be knocking and kicking it a lot harder if it was. however, the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil seem very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly made and is probably the only thing in the movie that has ever shocked me.
