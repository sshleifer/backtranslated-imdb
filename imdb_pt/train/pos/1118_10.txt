Well, this may be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Unfortunately, her career never took off, but - eventually - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate photos: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing". She uses different personalities from the New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces audiences in every scene, and she really is "very pretty." Watch this (if you're not from Iowa), you'll certainly have fun !!
