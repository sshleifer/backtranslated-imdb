The line, of course, is from the Lord's Prayer - "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Sweden, especially its far north, is not my idea of ​​heaven - winter temperatures are a bit weak for me, but good people living there no doubt think they are in God's country. <br /> <br /> The plot here is familiar. Acclaimed international musician Daniel suffers mid-career health collapse, dating back to the small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Persuaded by the local pastor to help with the church choir, he turns some unlikely talent into a class act, and they enter a competition held in Innsbruck in Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the "Brassed Off" band players the "Calendar Girls" models and the dancers of "The Full Monty". But of course it causes a lot of emotional upheaval when some of the most oppressed villagers realize their worth and revolt against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing but death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the rather hokey story, we know and like many of the characters, who come across people rather than caricatures, although many of them are recognizable "types", I wondered if the beater would not you go unpunished for so long? Sweden is a country in the world where such violence is greatly discouraged (he was also a bit young to be one of Daniel's youth bullies) and the puritan pastor with a secret passion for women's magazines was a bit stereotypical but wonderfully accomplished by Niklas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful as Daniel, the fragile but driven musician, and there is good music too. I was ecstatic for two whole hours. The end is what you make of it, I think, but it is not to ruin this to say that Daniel achieves what he set out to do.
