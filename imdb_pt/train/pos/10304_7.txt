"Bruce Almighty" looks incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. However, I found a deeper message that really made me like this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and receives divine powers for him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and although it is not his usual type of movie or one of his best roles, he does great with what he is given to work. Though crude at times, the film has a few laughs, from Bruce splitting his soup in half like the Red Sea and customer reactions to it, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid back and malicious image of God. It's overly overdone at times, and there's some crude humor, but overall it can be a bit funny. There's a decent supporting cast, like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film is very romantic and shocking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle." The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and much better than I and many people would probably expect, especially if we see the deeper message of the film. *** **
