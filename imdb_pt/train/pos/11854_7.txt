I agree with "Jerry". It's a very underrated space movie (of course, how many low-budget goodies are not underestimated?) As I recall, the solution to the mystery was a kind of variation (but not "stealing") from 2001 because the computer it controlled the spacecraft was actually a man, who had somehow become a computer. And as HAL, they tried to disconnect their "mind" but not the mechanical parts of it, and as with HAL, this led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. When the character of Christopher Cary, who can not find food, finds the bird abandoned, there is a sinister moment, but the obvious does not happen after all.
