Director Sidney Lumet did some masterpieces such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he was not having much luck in his most recent work. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but failed experiment. Now, Lumet brings his best film in decades and, in my point of view, a real masterpiece: Before the devil knows you're dead. I think this movie is like a revival for Lumet. This film has a great story that, deep down, has many layers. Also, I think the end of the film is perfect. The presentations are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, as usual, a magnificent performance and he is undoubtedly, one of the best actors of our day.Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated by my point of view. Your performance here is great. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances that were sadly ignored by the band. Pathetic Oscar. The film has a good level of intensity, partly nks for the performances and partly thanks to the brilliant script.Before Devil Knows You're Dead is a true masterpiece with perfect direction, a great script and great performances. We need more movies like this.
