Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in "The Amazing Mr. Williams," a comedy / mystery from 1939 which is very good, although forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films that were released in 1939. < > Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his work while his girlfriend waits for a marriage that is constantly postponed. What happens in this movie is no exception - he is called to a murder scene when he is about to walk down the hall once more. <br /> <br /> The two stars were excellent at comedy, worked together well (and often), and helped make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are available for excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not make much woman. <br /> <br /> Fun if a little on the longer side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films like the other man and best friend before coming to himself in movies like an old man. He was not lazy but a very hard-working actor (who made it seem easy) to have a career on Broadway simultaneously with his film career. He simply was not cast as a star in movies or received very challenging roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see their devastating performances in "Hud" and "I Never Sung to My Father" and call it lazy or refer to their smile.
