How can anyone say that this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. History intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad reviews and please watch the entire first season before deciding it is bad because I know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy the 1st season just like the 2nd season on DVD I hate Fox and I'm sure many of you "Dark Angel" fans hate them too. They have a crush on Canning Good Shows! Do not you all agree?
