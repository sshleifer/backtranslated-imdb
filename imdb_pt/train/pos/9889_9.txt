Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described my own feeling for this film more eloquently than I ever could. I'm just writing here to encourage you to look and see. <br /> <br /> I've seen this for many years on TV, I think IFC. It's such a unique movie that I hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not Durango, Mexico (from John Wayne movies), but a truly austere and wild place. I have to find the novel now to check out the original location of the story. As the location, this movie is weird and wild and wonderful and strange and absolutely not for everyone. It's the type of production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I had not really forgotten this movie, it's indelible. However, over the years, I had forgotten its existence. I do not know anyone I've seen, never read about it, nor seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name that I even forgot the title. Well, I'll be looking to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> I have since posting above becoming a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and regret for not having read it before. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment from MsMyth below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and was not commenting on Mexico or Mexican history at all, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still desperately trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. Did you like the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote. And, by the way, the original location of the story was Colombia.
