Japanese cyber-punk films have never done much for me, but of the few I've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least more entertaining. The CARBON MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a kind of parasite that takes care of humans, takes control of their bodies, turns them into necroborgs and makes them fight each other's sole purpose of eating to each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of said parasites. The film revolves around a timid and crazy boy who fall in love with each other, but whose love affair is interrupted by both being infected with the parasites, and are forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will versus control of the parasite over their physical bodies ... The MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO (as most cyber-punk films are), and for good reason. There are definitely some thematic parallels, although the films are definitely different. There are fun and fun times in the MEATBALL MACHINE, and the FX creature / borg is definitely the high point - a mix of TETSUO-meets-GWAR that is both elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of movies, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you like hip-kinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of splatter - this is for you ... 7/10
