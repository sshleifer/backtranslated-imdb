I just got back from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the Legend of ZU. I thought I kicked an * s! It was so creative and unique. It's the Crocodile Tiger Hidden Dragon with much less drama. Even if some thought there was a lot of special FX (yes, right!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! The Legend of ZU ..... kicks a * s !!!!!!!!
