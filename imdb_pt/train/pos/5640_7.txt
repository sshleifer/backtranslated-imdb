I really think this movie is great, personally. But in every movie there is a downer. Some of you may not have watched Hilary Duff's "Raise Your Voice," but if you think about it, these two shows are very very similar, if you know what I mean. In Brave New Girl, Holly wants so much to enter the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terri wants to go to a conservatory in Los Angeles (I can not remember the name of the conservatory there). Both are in the field of music and both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's very funny how these two movies look alike. I personally like Brave New Girl more than Raise Your Voice.
