Highly recommended !! <br /> <br /> A well written and funny movie that will please everyone with a sense of humor !!!. Take a chance, it's good to see an Independent British Movie more than holding onto the big established studios !! Definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this movie that I'm sure many people will relate to. You'll laugh out loud with your antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. I especially liked the version of the Vietnam Orb of Jimmy Cliff and the Tower of London over Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, give it a try ............ you will not be disappointed.
