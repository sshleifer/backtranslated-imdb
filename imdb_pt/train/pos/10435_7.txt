My watch is a bit late, but I'm happy to see both this and the sequel ... which makes me compliment the creators of this film for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romanticism ... and separating very marginally from from the idea of ​​relationships! As much has already been written about the film, it would be appropriate to highlight some parts of the film that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think the point where Jesse and Celine make fake phone calls to the movie. their respective friends were a very insightful way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey that did not last for 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people who think that the other had an infallible impact on the another was very cleverly contented with ... <br /> <br /> In front of the plot, making a romantic story work in pure conversation is not an easy job to do .. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic films of Such flavor, the characters are not clearly projected, even in the mind of the writer and director. What actors bring is what happens to them .. right or wrong even the bearers of the idea would find it difficult to justify ... become the character, the life that the actor gives has to go beyond the instructions and the story. .. here both actors just do the right job! Kudos .. !!! and before sunset is another feather that makes this even more beautiful!
