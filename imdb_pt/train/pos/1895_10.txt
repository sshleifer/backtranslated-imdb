I watched this over the Christmas period, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I watched, so there we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie that I watch all the way with a big stupid grin on my face and it's a mix of special performances, great joyful music and a crackling script with wit and charm that makes this happen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that can be hated very easily (pampered, rich, lazy who feels sorry for himself), but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla, a queens waitress who can do the hard / soft inside that Arthur almost gave up on his world. John Gielgud receives all the juicy lines and pollutes them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check if you need a lovely movie.
