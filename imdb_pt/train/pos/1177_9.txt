I've seen a lot of PPV's in the past, but this is the most entertaining and intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD extras are worth it because they give a different insight into how the fighters act after the show (such as the interview chris benoit / interview), a glimpse of the era of the second-beasts, Hogan's first game winning tag title gold and some promotional talk. Also, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team Tag Tag Game: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley Vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 This was a good intense fight to start the show. There are not many reservations and just pure raw physicality. Spike can do well in table matches and Guero and Benoit gave good skills of pure wrestling on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble with Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd did not really care about the wrestler and did not care until Kidman made a shooting star debut. Normally, people expect too much in a cruiserweight championship, but this had very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, no one cared or knew (you can tell by the lack of camera flashes). The ending was quick though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I've never really liked Regal as a fighter, he has no intensity and style. Hardy was impressive but really did not get a chance to show off his great act of flying although he still made some good markers and added the pace needed for the game. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena Vs. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny to remember Cena's first PPV, how he used to act, how he dressed and how he used to look (watching the interview, it's really funny). This was a good intense combat with Cena showing a good variety of passes, suplexes, counters and some antennas. Jericho was sub-par, but definitely helped Cena launch his career. Scene wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD Vs. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match. Both styles of fighters really matched well on the screen, with Brocks pure energy and brute energy vs.. RVDs ability full movements and speed. RVD looked great in this game (better than their last games with border and scene) and the whole game was fast. The final worked perfectly because it still preserved Brock's unbeaten line while giving RVD his fair desserts in his home state. <br /> <br /> 6. No disqualification match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that did not have a certain intensity as the departure of RVD, but still a good accompaniment. Although it started a bit slow (which is always with great show) Booker T was amazing and made a sick move on the table announcers. The finisher was incredible, the end was a big surprise and big change for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge Vs. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match. Hogan comes out as usual for a huge pop, but his variety of moves does not have that intensity and energy. So again, Christian does not have exactly the greatest athletic ability. This turned out to be a mediocre game at best, but it was still OK for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat for the Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily play the game of the year. This is by far the best triple threat I have ever seen. He had close downs, many finishers, stolen finishes, brute energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would get out of this. If you are going to buy this DVD, I buy it strictly for this game. (ending? Beware of yourself!) <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a solid PPV with lots of extras to keep you watching again and again. Although this is hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD) it is definitely worth your money.
