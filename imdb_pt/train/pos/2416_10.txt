yes, it's a bit of a silly movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget that ... but if you love John Candy's humor, that's a must-see. We missed John Candy before he made enough of his big comedy brand, and he's only better in a movie: airplanes, trains and cars (with Steve Martin). Excellent supporting performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work as Sal DiPasquale. Also good acting by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle. You should see this film obscure and exhausted if you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
