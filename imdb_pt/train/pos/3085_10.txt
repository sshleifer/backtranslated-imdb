I watched the episodes online and I was so sad that the show will not come back. He had the best cast of mature and talented actors and incredible chemistry. It seemed like all actors are personal friends in real life. In the end, the show has become engaging, sexy and highly watchable. Of course, some of the story lines are not realistic, so what ... The characters are all friendly and you root for them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great praise for the whole cast. Note to ABC executives: Nielsen ratings reports do not show true results. The audience of the show will mainly record. I've been very disappointed with big nets by flooding us with TV reality shows or teenagers. Why to get mature, considerate and successful material, do we have to switch to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. The new streaming media will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
