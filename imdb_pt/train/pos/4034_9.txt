Pinjar is a genuinely good movie, with great acting, good narrative, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of the films that Bollywood is producing is improving a lot these days, and this film is evidence. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood movie I can remember has made such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marveling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human. <br /> <br /> The film rests on the great performance of Urmilla Matondkar, and also some of Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in northern India at the bottom of the partition, and all the problems seem sweet compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> A must-see movie. A technically superior Bollywood product, which seems to me comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
