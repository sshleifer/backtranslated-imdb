PG-13 score for violence, brief sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story a few times now. In my opinion, Police Story is the best Chan movie of the 80s. originally did this because he did not like the other cop movie he had to star in that was The Protector. I have not seen the protector so I can not compare. The acting is not so bad and the plot is very good. I remember the plot because I saw this movie for some time, but what I remember is that this movie has a lot of action, acrobatics and comedies than a good Chan film needs. If you can find Police Story and you are a fan of Chan buy this movie! Runtime: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
