As a warning, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical (however, it contaminated me when I watched the musical :)) <br /> <br /> I really believe that Michael Douglas worked very well in that role together with Kasey. I think the 'Let me dance to you' scene is one of the best parts of the film, a valuable addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singers of the film are far superior to the musical, just as the cast is at least 10 times larger (easier to do in the film, of course). The decorations, lighting, dancing and singing are also far superior in the film, which should be expected, and was actually delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in tune with the musical are better in the movie, the new ones are very good, and the whole movie delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical that has few decorations. The only bad point of the film is the obvious cuts between the actors that speak, and they nicknamed the singers during the singing parts for some of the characters, but their dance is flawless, and the final product was nicer than the musical.
