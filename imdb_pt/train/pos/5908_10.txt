This is one of the brightest movies I've seen lately. It goes far above any international film of any reputation. I'm really surprised that it did not get the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni, winner of the National Prize, may be the only consoling fact. Renuka Daftardar simply surprises her as she speaks volumes through her eyes. There are some scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city in Krishna's marriage, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but no line of dialogue is said. The whole range of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and eyes. There is another at the end when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If you are not moved by that scene, you do not have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie to increase the brightness and ability of the cinema.
