Seeing how Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in TV history, it was a foregone conclusion that I would go to the movies and spend $ 15 on it. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria's fans. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Innocence begging, Pete goes in fun, runaway style, to seek the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story, but it left me a bit empty, but you certainly could do a lot worse.
