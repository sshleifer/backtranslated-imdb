I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, his film was sometimes, in my opinion, forgotten. But this movie is one of my favorites because it really gives the feeling of when the movie was set. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, the way of life, the way they dressed, the way they spoke, they could be exaggerated, but it's good to know that there was an occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts. <br /> <br /> I just felt that it was a story that should be wathced by many people and enjoyed by that fact. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I only saw it on TV. But for those who want a slice of the movie of life over this period of time this is the perfect one.
