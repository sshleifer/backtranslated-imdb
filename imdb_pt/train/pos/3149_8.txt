Not since the Simpsons made their debut, there was a sitcom I did not want to change in a matter of 2 minutes. Of course it was said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this one here. <br /> <br /> The first season was as remarkable as the teenage characters were not as outrageous as they later became. They even went to school sometimes. The following character seasons have been created. Eric, the sarcastic idiot, Donna, his balanced girlfriend, Kelso, the dark hustle, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, the perverted exchange student and finally Jackie, the rich and pampered floozy. As for the adult characters, there was Eric's mother, the suburban mother "you think she's such an idiot," Eric's father, the straight arrow who obviously was not as hard as he looked, Donna's silly dad and his blonde dumb mom. Everyone is loyal to their characters, but special thanks to Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite nice, without making us vomit with unexpected cuteness. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. It is a difficult character to play because it does not allow the actor to engage in a wild overacting as the character Kelso, played competently by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed watching the two characters interact because they are the most different. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is a little harder to appreciate because he's more realistic and we really need to see the story of orphans for the umpteenth time, though I say the writers have created a brilliant story for him in recent seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by Family Guy's musical artist Mila Kunis, is hilarious and has nails on a type of blackboard. voice that really fits into your character. The only sad part is that we did not see more scenes with her and Eric because they were f ... hilarious together. A lot of history has been wasted on their relationship problems, since we've already gotten this with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll say that the cast of guest actors has always been great. Some favorites: Fez's huge girlfriend mid-season, Pastor Dan, the totally fantastic Leo played by the equally amazing Thomas Chong, another of Fez's girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance of the teenage witch Sabrina as a Sacanagem catholic girl . <br /> <br /> Coming next on Fox, whatever.
