There have been some great moments of reality portraying modern life (not just in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how culture can be stifling and want to break away from the mold it has created for you. <br /> <br /> Dance was just a vehicle to say "do what you love even if it's against the norm". . Pretty Billy Elliot as I would say. I liked that movie too. The mood was well timed, and the touching moments seemed so real that you could feel the embarrassment between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and that wig and his excess on the dance floor made me just howl! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I watched it a second time and picked up some small nuances that I missed at first viewing. Good entertainment!
