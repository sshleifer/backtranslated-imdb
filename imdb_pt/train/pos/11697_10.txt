This movie was really eye-opening. I've seen this movie several times. First, when I was four years old and I really remembered it and when I was 12 years old. The whole message the director is broadcasting is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of letting God out of our daily lives or simply an extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers!
