This is my favorite of the older Tom & Jerry cartoon of the early 40's. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is in the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, disc 1, and shows the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons. The jokes about this are not all Avery-style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who has stayed up late watching horror movies (or radio shows)! Tom is listening to a scary radio program, and Jerry decides to play a series of tricks to scare him. The nine-life gag is well done here, and I do not know how many times I've tried to make a vacuum and a scary sheet when I was a kid. When Tom's owner is awakened by the tumult - Mammy was NOT the maid, it was her house - she has a surprise, with a great laugh. Prepare your pause button, it's worth it!
