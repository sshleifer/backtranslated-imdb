This movie impressed me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. It's a movie that shows the harsh reality of life in Los Angeles, starting with recurring helicopter search lights looking for the perils lurking so close to the common lives being carried by the characters. It's also a movie that shows how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, intentionally or unintentionally, has powerful repercussions. I found this movie similar in many ways to Robert Altman's Short Cut movie. Both had a list of perfectly chosen actors and actresses, and both films allowed you to gradually see how the characters interrelated and affected each other, for better or for worse. The Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message (hope in the face of desperate reality) than the Altman movie, although I found both intriguers in their own way. This movie is definitely a must see !!!
