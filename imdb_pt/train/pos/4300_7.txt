This movie might well have been one of those common "novels" that tell the daily lives of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ... broken relationships, building new friendships, street hills, almost accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby dumped under some bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond these daily events and asks questions to be considered, even though there are no satisfactory answers. He asks in this chaotic world that things just happen, it's just luck when things turn out right or, taking a fatalistic view, is a person predestined to be in a certain place at a certain time and so get involved in the event. and does your future take on a new perspective? Most of us had this weird experience. <br /> <br /> Is our superego that makes us believe that we are so important? How does a character say? Once he sat on the waterfront overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to realize just how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies, but it is a good study of human relations. Danny Glover is excellent in a nice role.
