No, not really, but this is really a very good movie and it is unfortunately a forgotten gem. Black and white combine with the film. <br /> <br /> Direct formula, a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before he died. <br /> <br /> Well directed, and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as the male leader is good but is completely lost in Paul Douglas's acting as police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than that) and Zero Mostel as the villains. Unfortunately Palance went on to play similar characters in some gangster or second-rate war films.
