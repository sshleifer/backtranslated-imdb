Not surprisingly, writer / director Michael Powell has considered "A Matter of Life and Death," his fascinating 1946 Emeric Pressburger fantasy to be a favorite of his films together. Launched during the aftermath of World War II, this colorful romantic adventure would have provided only the tonic for a traumatized and recovering nation that needs a good boost. <br /> <br /> Following a series of other patriotic war movies, 'The archers have made this the most quirky, aloof and patriotic of the lot. Quintessentially British for defending the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, manners), is also visibly Americanized in its baroque compositions, technical inventiveness and a beautiful multi-ethnic cast. Strangely echoing another 1946 classic, "It's a Wonderful Life," AMOLAD opens in a great firmament, with one of those joyful voices preaching on earth and the heavens, and what a great and wonderful world we live in . <br /> <br /> Then he cuts into a British cockpit, heavily hit, on fire and with the co-pilot already dead. It seems wrong, but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> In about 5 minutes, the quick exchange between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American radio contact in June. (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its intimacy. Resigned to die, Peter, however, exhausts a lot of vigor, charm and confession of effusion, and his warm affiliation with June ends with a mutual exchange of "I love you". Keeping with the magic of the moment, Peter, by the supervision of his Master 71, whose job it was to transport him to the 'Other World', escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach. He later finds June riding a bicycle and instantly blends in with the body with his voice. <br /> <br /> But realizing their mistake, the high court wants Peter to be sent back, and send the French Maestro (Maurice Goring) to the land to retrieve it. But Peter is adamant in living because of the error of June and the Maestro, and intentionally saves his singing. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate is in the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury is composed of several deceased. war heroes and elegant British delegates. The surreal judgment, which dissolves back into capital letters in the rich Technicolor, as the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the final shot at the hospital validates the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> The abstract, Filling of pictures "Stairway to Heaven" (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in black and white, when Peter and his enigmatic French guardian raise up , crossing giant statues of Peter's potential lawyers for the trial, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the staircase of softly lit colors provides the backdrop for what is an iconic image in the movies - Peter and June, frozen side by side, with wondering eyes fixed on the frame, their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> The improbable affection shared between Peter and June never goes limp or verbose; is treated with nobility and with the realization that the couple is already adequate enough to get married and simply needs to convince people of their love so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French maestro, who can freeze people's time and body, shows many of his key moments together, lecturing on the story and his tricks, pinching the book 'Top 100 Game Tricks' Peter and his coffee. cup. <br /> <br /> As visually inspired as other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, this was the first time they combined color with b / w ?? the latter having a cheerful quality when used for sky scenes, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The excellent script more than combines with the imaginative set design, with a dialog that sounds so immediate that it does not look like it was written or executed to the screen. Fun and witty, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves equal acclaim with its strong color and composition. Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that challenges you to age, looking fresh and inventive, even at this time when CGI would increase their artificial effects, probably taking them away from their emotional wonder. Other sudden changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for the cut and the inevitable appeal to shorten the dialogue so that it can preserve the low attention of most audiences. Powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter's situation.
