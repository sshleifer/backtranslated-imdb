CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor has sat higher in the western world than James Stewart, and this movie proves that. This superb tale of revenge, centered around a Winchester rifle, has only one weak spot I can think of: the cast of Will Geer as a Wyatt Earp much like an EARP. The cast of the villains was good: Stephen McNally, Henry Henry, Dan Duryea as Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile in playing both good guys and villains) as a smart runner. The clash between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I stacked this Western against the entire Western harvest made today. They would not have a chance!
