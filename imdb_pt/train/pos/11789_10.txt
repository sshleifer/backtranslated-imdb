Hello, this little movie is interesting especially for an artist, filmmaker or music creator or a visual artist, for: <br /> <br /> You can feel and examine David's touch / style directly from a small piece of relative simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots, the pots and the sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple film, this creation is multilayered. For example, there are some sounds that buzz all the time, while others appear (though subtle) at certain points to support certain pictures. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of pots: some go up and down. on a smooth round trip. There is diagonal bread. Zooms also come and go at times. The lightning and the composition / arrangement of the elements in space is, as usual and obviously, the work of a painter / artist. This can be felt even in this low quality room. That is to say: one can already do exquisite art for the simple art of putting the visual / sight and composing the scene. Next, the bases of the visuals come: digonales, parallels, etc. Gradients and colors of light, though without much research for textures, as in large productions, are also good. This is an outline of a type of artist ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated, but done with inner feeling and this sensation gives the touch / feel of David to it, as with any true artist .
