This movie is great. It's fun from start to finish, you'll always be on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this film is highly underrated by critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of well-trained mountain rescue Gabe Walker. Along with him, Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I saw of him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie happens on a mountain with a bunch of thugs this paves way for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
