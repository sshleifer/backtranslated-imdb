This is the epitome of the fairy tale! The villains are completely evil and the heroes are refreshingly pure. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful, as is the new actor who plays Tristan. Incredible performances, delicious magic, funny and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale finale make this movie absolutely fabulous! I'm not so sure that all content is appropriate for younger children, but for an older audience, there are many hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do justice to this movie! My fiance and I were pretty skeptical, but we were so excited that we had a chance in this movie that I just hope to make sure someone on top of the movie would try!
