This is a thunderous British comedy movie and one I could watch over and over again without getting bored. Peter Ustinov has never presented himself in a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his dry insight but a very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been a fan of mine since he starred in Streets of San Francisco. I believe that Maggie Smith is the true star of this movie, seeming to be so inept at everything she tries to do, but in fact is so connected, particularly in the end, when she informs everyone that she invested so much money that she discovered while washing your clothes. However, one thing worries me, could anyone tell me why I can not buy this in DVD or VHS format in the UK, could anyone help?
