I had the pleasure of seeing a "Milanese" film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who understood adequately and fortunately printed in a film the philosophy of Milan. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a professional Milanese couple, from "birth" to death. Birth marriage is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a story of how the couple met and fell in love. Life is hard in the "city" of Milan and after the old times have become harder and harder, finally the product: a child, who instead of further strengthening the couple relationship weakens because the "selfish effect" typical of nowadays "metropolis" personality. The advertising environment with the whole "creative" atmosphere under stress helps you get involved in the plot. We are losing the values ​​of life and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and clear film by director Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca nice and well characterized, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known by the "junk" TV series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
