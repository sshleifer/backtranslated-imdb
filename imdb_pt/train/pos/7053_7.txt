Do not confuse "War Inc." to a neatly sculpted satire or a clever comedy filled with inner jokes for news fans. It is not. <br /> <br /> It's an old-fashioned crazy comedy with ridiculously coincidental twists, backstage characters (with some depth in fun presentations by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei, and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to the content. See, the political points of filmmakers are things that almost the whole country already knows are true. Yes, we understand that the corporations that profit from the war are corrupt and inept pigs, responsible political leaders are even more inept clowns, and American imperialism has never looked coarser and outdated than it is now - but none of that is the point. <br /> <br /> Here, all this noise is the scene they satirized - sometimes genially - as a backdrop for a silly joke, like the character of John Cusack (success (man with heart) tries to change his life with the help of the journalist who does not trust him (Tomei) and the young star of the Middle East who wants to cancel his marriage (Duff) Cusack's sister Joan interprets his assistant with an almost enthusiastically caricatured quality. it seemed to me to be wasted in its smallest part as a ruthless CIA boss. That's all, and it works. It's fun, but if somehow you can not see the reality and think the war is over. going well and everyone involved is doing a good job and there is no corruption and people in the Middle East want our Western culture to overtake theirs so you might not find it funny. For all of us, was a mild comedy with a political advantage .
