I've always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd, since I've seen her series a few years ago !! This movie certainly shows its best light yet !! The movie was beautifully released and played !! From time to time she lets out little fun lines, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everyone really came out !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie come true !! I also loved the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she almost dies when she falls on the floor !! This is the movie at its best!
