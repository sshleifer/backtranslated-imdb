Things to Come is a rarity of rarities, a movie about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few try to show us how this future came about. The first part of the movie, when the war reaches Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, the movie audience in its launch year laughed at news that enemy planes were attacking England - the appeasement was at its peak. Wells's prediction was confirmed very soon.) couple working model, is more effective. Explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his ensembles of Everytown Ruins are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the boss's lover. Everytown of the 21st Century is an equally awesome design. Acting in the history of the 21st century is not convincing - perhaps this was a misguided attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of that era with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, model work, representing angry crowds rushing through the high passages, is ridiculously poor and could have been made much better, even with 30s technology. This is particularly annoying since the giant aircraft scenes are very convincing. This is redeemed by the magnificent speech of Raymond Massey, who concludes the film - rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been so well expressed. Massey's latest issue is more relevant now than ever before, in an era of severely manned spaceflight. The scene is aided by the thrilling music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose surname I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions edit a rather interesting assembly of machines and futuristic workers that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the entire film.
