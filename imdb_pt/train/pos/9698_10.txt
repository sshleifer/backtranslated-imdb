I've seen this movie countless times and for my life, I can not understand why some people compare this to BABE. This movie is not about the secret life of ALL the animals that can secretly talk. Instead, it is a parrot that learns to talk to help its owner, a little girl with a serious stuttering, to overcome her speech problem only to separate from her in a heartbreaking scene. Then the great journey begins. Paulie, the Parrot, tries to find his great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and countless unpleasant people. He falls in love with a parrot girl and loses it. He is taken to a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a friendly janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved. Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines as the kindly caretaker who has an open mind and a big heart and who decides to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the decadent characters he encounters. <br /> <br /> There is a little suggestive language, but this movie is suitable for most children and even more so if the parents join in the fun and watch as well. It's an epic, clever and epic story of animal adventure and finally a great love story about a bird and his little girl. He searches for Marie ends with a rather unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen the wild tribes of green parrots in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from watching this movie and understand that birds, especially parrots are not disposable pets. Every child, everywhere, will see that pets form deep attachments and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured. <br /> <br /> So there's no BABE here, another incredible journey with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to rip during the sad parts.
