I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it. Stone once again delivered a great character. She was as good as the first basic instinct. She still has these clever but complicated answers. Although Sharon is 48 years old ... she looks incredible! I do not care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! Half the people commenting on this movie or saw it. So do not listen to them.
