Although I do not consider myself a big fan of fairytale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, she's as convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her horrible makeup at the beginning and the end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do a good job here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also stunning faces from Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as the girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we know her. Rookie Charlie Cox is as well as the leader Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan when young that I thought that it was him in the first scenes with Magowan (in fact, Ben Barnes). Many comments compared this to The Promised Princess and while I can see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you are seeing and hearing could have happened even with all the joy that happens everywhere. So on that note, I highly recommend Stardust.
