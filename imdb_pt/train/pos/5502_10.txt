Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good a man Chavez is. It is really to demonstrate how the Bolivarians saw how this happened, Chavez's way of seeing it. Although it may seem wrong and inclined to support a movie, I think the viewpoint shown in the film is absolutely legitimate. The Venezuelan people, through the private media corporation of Venezuela, saw only a perspective on the side of the coup, the neoliberal side. This film shows the way the Bolivarians saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it's a judgment on your part.
