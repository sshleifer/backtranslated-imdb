Although this series has only one season, it remained with me for 20 years. It was by far and above all my favorite cartoons of all time. I would give almost anything to have it on DVD or any other format that I may have. If you can find some way to see this series, I suggest you make the most of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent plot that went through several episodes. It also made me really care about the characters and what happened to them. Hell, the Goose character really scared me sometimes. He was so strange back then. Also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / rights holder of the series and can put them on DVD, please do so !!!
