"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that was proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it's actually one of the best movies ever made in the United States. It is both artistically valid and fully accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge hit when it was initially released. But be warned, it's also one of the most moving movies of all time. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the end of Hollywood, something that was basically mandatory in the 1980s. Still, that's why I value the years from 1967 to 1977 for American cinema. It's a time when well-made, innovative and, above all, dark films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this ended when "Star Wars" was released. <br /> <br /> The direction of John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films that feature these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has aged very well. It's still as powerful now as when it was first released. Performance, however, is what makes it a masterpiece. The backgrounds of the characters are never fully explained, but the performances make them fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and friendly (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, being a fan of vintage exploring movies, I loved the scenes set on 42nd street infamously sleazy. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful movies ever made.
