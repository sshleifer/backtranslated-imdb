Full marks for the interpretation of Pacino's speech about the dead boy's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be ashamed !! <br /> <br /> Is it Paul Schrader or Ken Lipper who should be praised for the remarkable dialogues? They are rich and smart and are worth their time if you like movies with good scripts. I found the narrative of the story developing very well until the voice post-up. <br /> <br /> There is not much to talk about in this movie; even John Cusack did better than this. Curiously, the film is very masculine - women are mere appendages.
