Oddly enough, this movie never hit the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video to come out. My expectations were high, but by no means disappointing. As always happens with Ang Lee, there is a fantastic performance, a clever and exciting plot that makes you guess until the end and wonderful footage. Together with Unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 1990s. People expecting something along the line from Mel Gibson in The Patriot (Braga) or Braveheart (Acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, everyone else who appreciates the qualities mentioned above will have a fantastic time watching you. 9 out of 10.
