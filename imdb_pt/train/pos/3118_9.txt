Not having seen the two previous ones in the trilogy of the Bourne films, I was a bit reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience and I did not have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two movies. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with the Bourne Ultimatum before it hit the break! I do not think I've ever seen such an exquisite and thrilling movie, especially an action movie. Since I usually avoid action and suspense movies, that was great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most captivating films, attracts the attention of the first second until the last minute before the credits are released. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances on Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of your movies in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were done in style - each was done brilliantly and I was shocked by the impression of this movie. Well done.
