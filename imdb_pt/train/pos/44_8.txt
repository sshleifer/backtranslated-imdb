When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another girl's movie. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met, I recommended this movie to. No one came back saying it was bad. Busy, he also did a great job with his role in this movie. I do not know much about her acting career, but our way of doing the ending of this movie was great. In the beginning, it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital .... wow, the movie picks up again. I have no idea why this movie was not spoken in the movie world. My wish would be for this movie to be released again and announced more ... because it sends a powerful message in just an hour and a half.
