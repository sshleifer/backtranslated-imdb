Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I've been watching the entire season online since I found it and I was terribly disappointed that there was not a second season: '(and, above all, ABC has taken it off the air, so it can not be seen online) would ABC create such a wonderful show with a great story and great characters just to get you off the air without ever completing the story? It seems to be left to our imagination to find out what happens to all our characters. Honestly, I think ABC could at least put the show online for entertaining viewers as they continued to view the overrated reality TV shows.
