I had the pleasure of watching this beautiful movie last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director after the screening. I suspect the first commenter never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. I had a lot of losses, and this movie talked to me. One of the main issues is how we do not deal with issues / issues / stories with our loved ones until it's too late - they are very disabled or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen and record your stories, tell people that you love them, resolve differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I love the portrait of the relationship director of the two daughters - as one of the six siblings, it is clear to me that he understood how complex these relationships are. His story as a director of photography also appears loud and clear - what a beautiful film! The cast is excellent - a movie not to be missed!
