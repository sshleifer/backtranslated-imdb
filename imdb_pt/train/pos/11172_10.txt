Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel (I read the book first and decided to see the movie). First of all, the plot is truly original and unique. The acting is also great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (played by Fred Gwynne) fits perfectly and really sells for you. There are also some cheesy lines played there (Idk if they were meant to be tacky), but they will really lighten the mood and give a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is a perfect place to shoot this movie and it attracts you throughout the movie. Not only will you love it, but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend it 100% for any horror fan !!
