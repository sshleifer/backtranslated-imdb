Wonderfully together ... I wish there was a follow up of this documentary to accompany the lives of some and celebrate the lives of the lost others ... there should be a part two ... a true one. It was great .. the movie was not long enough .. I wonder why the creator of the movie did not follow up !! this is so important to the community period ... well, if you're reading this, please consider making another such documentary ... I'm really tired of hearing from naive writers like AIDS and Men walk together when they do not they do; in fact it's the straight one we need to investigate ... this movie did not even bother mentioning HIV or AIDS and I was so happy about it ... I really appreciated the flaws and definitions as well. Thank you very much for allowing this film to exist.
