Turned out to be a production class with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is incredible, from dwarves wielding axes to 7-foot ghouls! I liked the relationship between the links, not overly sentimental, but romantic enough to maintain interest. I also enjoyed the mix of humor (which can be very easy to miss, plenty / not enough) which meant it did not get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a big step up from the other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of plot and production. They have a great website that is worth checking out. I can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it must be fantastic.
