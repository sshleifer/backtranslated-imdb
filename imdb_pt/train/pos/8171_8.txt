I realize that this review will impress me with movie critics patrolling this site, but I'll defend that movie. <br /> <br /> The dentist is really a very good movie. The performance is not always top-notch, but the emotions are good and the story is good. Also, you see Linda Hoffman's breasts. Not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great scary dentist. It makes dentists what Jaws does to sharks ... ish. Obviously, it had a very limited budget, but they did well with what they could and developed well the characters (those who count). <br /> <br /> the end.
