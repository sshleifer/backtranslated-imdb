This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to represent the performance he gave in this movie. Duchovny was top notch, as were Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a scenic drive through historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars of all time, the 1960 Lincoln Continental model. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He likes his women not to curse or smoke, and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are parkers of trailers from the rural outskirts. Although the majority tone of the film is bleak, there are many funny scenes. The writing, direction and acting are brilliant. If you like road movies, murder, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everyone delivers, and you'll want more when the credits roll. One of my all time favorites. "Hey ... shave that dog and teach him how to hunt!"
