I'm definitely not in the target audience of this movie. I am a man of almost 50 years who recently stumbled in the world of independent cinema. This happened by chance, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late at night on television. The first two things I noticed about the movie were: 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to get interesting. When he said his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I had seen on DVD a week before, I decided I had to go and have a look. The result could be described in the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are nothing alike in terms of content. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through incredible writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who apparently forces himself to be constantly busy, he is always running in one way or another, filling his life with little things so he never has to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas in this film are strong and poignant. I can tell by watching that it has not changed much since I was growing up, young people still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, creates wonderfully honest characters and makes them do completely believable things. As for independent cinema, this may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view, it is very close.
