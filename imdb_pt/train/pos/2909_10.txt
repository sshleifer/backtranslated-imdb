I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. I could not, however, pay a ticket to your show at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the US tour. I was annoyed to say the least. So I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still the man and I'm going to enjoy it for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I'd like to hear everyone from Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Paul is not dead either. <br /> <br /> The biggest concert DVD of all time. <br /> <br /> ** *** out of *****.
