Cuban Blood is one of those movies that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched as I sailed in Cuba on a Western Caribbean cruise. He details the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. One does not spend much time with the revolution until the end when the socialist regime came and took ownership of the boy's father. Most of the film is the maturing of the boy and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A film with good acting and directing. This is a movie that tells a story without special effects or great schemes or real twists. It's a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie is worth watching several times a year.
