I really enjoyed the first episode and I look forward to more. A bit soft in front of the crime (it's almost a late reflection and not terribly suspenseful or fulfilled), but I thought the angle of the novel was wonderfully charming. Will be watching again for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope they have a bigger role for aunts who are wonderful actresses and who were underused this time around. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched, I think) is very sweet and bubbly and looks so good and sweet and stupid instead of annoying, which is very good. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
