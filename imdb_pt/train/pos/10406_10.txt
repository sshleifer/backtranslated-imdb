Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed recover his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer. As Europe was heading for war and significant sections of the world were on fire, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this luxurious escapist fare of the Arabian Nights legends. Full of swords and witchcraft, it gave the public in 1940 a brief relief from the headlines. It is also a great cinematographic piece, presenting good acting and an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets the highest billing and he deserves, playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with piercing eyes reminds him of the macabre roles he had played with such delight during the days of Silence. Here's a villain worth watching. As the boy thief, Sabu is perfectly released in his third film. Although not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in action and action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does a good job. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as the unenlightened king, who must learn about the realities of living the hard way; Sabu gets a significant portion of the action (when he is not turned into a dog), but Justin is appropriately athletic when needed. Lovely June Duprez plays the threatened Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing at the end of the film, the massive Rex Ingram shakes things up like a genius with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his beautiful voice as a good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson has another eccentric role as the Basra Children's Sultan, always hesitant about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the screen and the dialogue). Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an outstanding theater actress, plays the double role of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-legged Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The film began in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move to Southern California. which probably explains the presence of the American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most eye-catching, especially the fairytale architecture in blues, whites and pinks. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was hired in the stables of the Maharaja of Mysore when it was discovered by the Korda company and placed before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After a distinguished military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but was eternally confined for years playing ethnic roles in indistinct minor films, BLACK NARCISO (1947) being the only exception. His last film, A TIGER WALKS (1964), by Walt Disney, was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, at only 39 years of age.
