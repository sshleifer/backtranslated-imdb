After you see Vertigo, then watch Bell, Book and Candle, made within months of each other. <br /> <br /> My second favorite movie of Kim Novak, with Picnic, coming in third. <br /> <br /> <br /> All three presentations are great, Vertigo being the best of them all. <br /> <br /> They came to my place in Kansas City Prairie near, in Salina, Kansas in the 1950s, to film, Picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell's soundtrack, Book and Candle, I believe, is one of Alex North's. Perfect for this bit of comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, made this comedy, as amusing to note the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> Worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo from my youth.
