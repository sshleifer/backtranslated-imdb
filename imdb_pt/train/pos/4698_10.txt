Just like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets better and better every day. This clever, witty and well-represented movie might as well stand on its own - but, as a parody of the gangster genre, it really is exceptional. In fact, it's obviously the best film of its kind ... the funniest parody of Mafia movies and even its period - though admittedly this position is probably easier to reach when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar pseudocommunications and tasteless. like "Jane Austen Mafia".
