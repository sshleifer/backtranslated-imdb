I just saw the ASSASSINATE IN VANTITIES in the newly released Universal Pre-Code set, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the vehicle from end to end. Most of the other commentators covered the story, a murder mystery within a musical, but I wanted to add some additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland, compared to most of the smaller musicians, and none of them does seem to really have the appropriate voice for what they are singing (Carlisle being a trained opera singer, Brisson a little hesitant in some of his highs and lows) low grades). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanity girls, but let's not forget the splendid jazz singer Ernestine Anderson at "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of her first appearances, sounding a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would become the executive producer of the TV series Perry Mason. Then there's Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe lover - you'll also see her in David COPPERFIELD (as Auntie Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson introducing the standard "Cocktails for Two" into two different scenes; "Sweet Marihuana," with peyote button girls barely dressed in the background (the blood running down the white skin of a chorino was wonderfully creepy); the "Ebony Rhapsody," with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and a bunch of gorgeous black and white dancers mixing it. And I believe this is one of the first musicals to feature such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
