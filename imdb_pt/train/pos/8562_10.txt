I liked! The plot was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC kissing were awkward for both of them. Drews acting was dishonest in some places, but this could be related to his life at the time. Dennis Christopher as the psychiatrist was really cool, and as always he does his best - I'm a big fan of Dennis, that's why I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the end! that strange red-skeleton animatronic thing looked just like it was out of film school, which is OK, I guess, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole thing with the knife - was it so uncomfortable because they just did not get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing when it was the weird thing about Doppelganger or when it was DC - or was it Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger stayed with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick if it were Dennis as the Doppelganger, then I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was good but intrusive in some places, the whole orchestral score seemed to revolve around a theme, but that theme was an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> A great mix of blood and Drew's free nude shots. <br /> <br /> All in all a bit of a GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Do not read too much, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script, because you will not find it. There are a few moments of diamonds and goops galore- WATCH AND JUST HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH HIM!
