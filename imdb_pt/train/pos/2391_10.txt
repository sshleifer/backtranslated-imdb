My husband and I enjoy DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby does. We buy DVDs and CDs so we can watch them and listen to them alone. They are fun, energetic and very fun. They encourage children to be active, share and caring. They always have a positive message along with entertaining entertainment. Every time our son hears the theme song, he quickly turns his head to the television and starts jumping up and down with excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone with kids. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not stop smiling and want to dance when you listen.
