So many educational films are nothing more than a numbing painful job, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" mocks them ("Why Study Industrial Arts?" Comes to mind). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually very well done. It's all about blood, heart and circulatory system. I admit I do not remember everything, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious, but fun. I think you can always count on June Foray (more famously the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here). <br /> <br /> Since "Hemo the Magnificent" can be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class is watching while a gremlin is forming.
