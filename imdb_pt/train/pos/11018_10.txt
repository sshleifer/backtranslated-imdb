This movie is really harrowing Cliffhangin movie! Stallone was good as always! Michael Rooker made an amazing performance and John Lithgow play an excellent villain! The music is fantastic, especially the theme! The movie is full of action and never bland! If you are a fan of Stallone, then watch Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
