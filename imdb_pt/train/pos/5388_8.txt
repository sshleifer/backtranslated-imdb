I saw this movie yesterday at Turner, and I could not help but watch until it was over, though I could imagine what would happen. Farrell was great in his role, and everyone did a super job. Some of them seemed to stretch the limits, but after all, I loved it !! If you have the chance to see, please do! I actually cried in some scenes, but I think if you're a mother, you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was amazed at the thought of being single moms, seemed ahead of her time. I say, watch if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I liked very much!
