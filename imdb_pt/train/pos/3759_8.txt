Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are becoming rock stars in the current future, but they still need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted are in public popular history, but then a wicked man (Joss Ackland) is ready to kill Bill & Ted, sending cyborg armor to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent to this past and they actually kill the real Bill & Ted. Now both guys are spirits and they have to travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made an intelligent sequence with great visual effects. Much funnier and fun than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> The DVD has a good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85: 1) transfer and a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD features the theatrical trailer and a fun backstage feature. This sequel was box office hit like the original, but it is also (Believe it or not), one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin reprises his original paper shortly. Pam Grier also appears in a small role. It's a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
