So you should see this movie, to understand reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke is now a champion of those suffering from bipolar disorder; Formerly labeled manic-depression. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that nowadays people still criticize others with emotional problems, or those who seek psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and this is regrettable. <br /> <br /> In this film, the public sees the pain and suffering that Mrs. Duke has passed, especially as a child. Many of us may remember her from the teen "Patty Duke Show." She was a household name in America at age 15. <br /> <br /> You learn about her exploration for Ross' (well played by Howard Hesseman). As it was growing in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. However, we see how she advances in her career, but the disease worsens. It goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone to whom she divorces the following week; and she has multiple conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother. All these problems occurred before she received proper therapy and medication. <br /> <br /> A recent survey released by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) found that most American adults do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of the disease. bipolar disorder. It was also reported that one in five respondents in the survey believed that people could control their disease without medication if they wanted to. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not "pull herself up for her bootstraps" and "stay well" until she was educated about her disorder, and received appropriate treatment. Thank you, Mrs. Duke, for being a champion against ignorance and prejudice.
