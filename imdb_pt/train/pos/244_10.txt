I did not know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but I loved it. It was dark, dramatic and exciting. I also felt very authentic, I felt I had been transported back to the 1800's. I've never been much of a fan of Heath Ledger, having just seen him in teen type movies, however he's quite convincing in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a very witty kid has become Australia's most notorious killer. Naomi Watts is great in a supporting role as a lover of Kelly's society. Highly recommended - and this is an Aussie!
