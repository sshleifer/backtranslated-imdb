11 Oscar nominations and zero win !!! I still have to understand why - it's not how the actors in the movie did better after you can do it by giving them prizes for trivial roles like it was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc - were all amazing - I'm curious to get scripts from the discussions at the Oscars that year ...... should get into the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges .... It's an incredible book - but true to Alice Walker's writing style, she has a way of appearing that she is exaggerating her characters - so I'm so happy that the screen adaptation took a few things. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was incredible - the African scenes live a lot to be desired - the African part of the book should be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT, oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can not think of Africa outside the safaris - so yes, there should be a scene of Zebra and wildlife when we all know there is no West Africa - and most of all, why people speak Swahili --- who in West Africa speaks Swahili ?? I just had to get it out of the way ....... But like a story - amazing, cinematic - out of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <I own it and watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
