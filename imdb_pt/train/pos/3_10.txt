"Everyone is a stage and their actors people in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said that the theater stopped in the pit of the orchestra - or even at the door of the theater? Why are not the audience participants in the theatrical experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This film was a great experience that said, "Hey, the story is you and needs more than your attention, you need your active participation." "Sometimes we bring the story to you, sometimes you have to go down in history." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately no one has heard, but that does not mean it should not have been said.
