This is a movie that I had never thought to see until my 3-year-old son saw it at the store and picked it up after liking the cover photo of the animals on Nabooboo Island. We have got it and watched it repeatedly since; in fact, we have rented several times since. There are very few non-animated films that my son will watch and pay attention to; What a beautiful change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The performance is great, the songs are compelling, they go deep into your head and you can not help but sing along. The plot while specifically about WW2 is timeless in its own way and there is something new to see every time you watch. I heard this compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and that parents will not bother to meet. There's been days before nap time and bedtime, and I do not feel that moan coming when he wants to repeat any other movie.
