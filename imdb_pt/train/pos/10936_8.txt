Most Kong Kong martial arts films of the 70s and 80s do not work like movies; there are usually some well-planned fight sequences, but the plot is too thin to fill the gaps between these nodes - like porn movies, actually. <br /> <br /> But this does several things well. More openly, there is the direction and choreography, which confines each fighter to a 'style' - it is actually based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comic theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Second, there is the camera language, which uses some impressive techniques (even by today's measure), changing real-time slow-motion speeds for slow-motion and unfiltered views for filtered to portray the direction of history in relation to the past or toward the future. <br /> <br /> Less obvious, but more powerful and unexpected, is construction. The winner of this contest is determined by who 'unfolds' the story. The master creates a game in which the main character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation as the spectators meet. One by one, he discovers who is who, at the same speed we find who is who. Everything follows an arc of tragedy / noir. The ending tends to irony, to "The Sting." Things much smarter than we usually get out of this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the "five poisons" is the model for Tarantino's "viper killers" from the "Kill Bill" volumes.
