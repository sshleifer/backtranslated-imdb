This was a top-notch film with a high-level cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Christopher Lloyed are well involved in this lovely movie about real life angels helping the Angels baseball team. You never know, this can happen. I loved Lloyd's part in that. He was hilarious. The story is about how to transform your life, how the boy's belief in Angels helped turn the Glover manager angry, hardened and embittered see the best in people. The film was well done and also about seeing the best of people and achieving their dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, all very well done. You will like (or love) that. I guarantee. out of ****
