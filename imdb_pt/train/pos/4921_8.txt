As a Trap Named Desire (also directed by Gadg on stage and screen), Panic In The Streets portrays a New Orleans in which its main claim to fame - the cradle of Jazz - does not even mention a mention. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and undoubtedly went a long way toward establishing him as the best actor he really was, not just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in a small uncredited role as a morgue assistant, but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance (as Walter Jack Palance) while the location Mr 'Big' followed the Zero Mostel side Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig, plus the ever-reliable and dependable Paul Douglas as the cop who appears to document Widmark's point of view. It's a very rewarding film more to be seen little. Capture if you can.
