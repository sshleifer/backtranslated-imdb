(spoilers ??) <br /> <br /> I did not know what to think of the movie. It's not much of a children's movie. It should definitely be watched with one parent because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that I was a little amused by this. <br /> <br /> I was a bit disappointed with the 81 minutes of time we had. (even less without the credits) And the trailer makes you think the rodent is a main creature. But, unfortunately, they torture him. Until the end of the movie. These two complaints docked the movie 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for a sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
