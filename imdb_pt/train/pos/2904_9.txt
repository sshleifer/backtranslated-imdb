This film is the second immersion of Damian Szifr√≥n in films after his excellent study of character in "The Bottom of the Sea". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well-made characters, far from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I saw Szifron's talent for presenting all the characters in a lightweight way, but just enough to engage us emotionally with them. His control over them is magnificent, so he restores in the film a great direction and a brilliantly polished overall script, the characters laugh and weep with real feeling and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Spaniards dominate the English, Buenos Aires urban landscape replaces Hollywood sets, and the premise is as interesting as any, so we have a movie that dares to compete with the Hollywood machinery. <br /> But I want you to see the movie mainly because I have never dealt with such nice characters, all of them. It seems that the script fits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I really believe that with a film like this, Argentina is really up to the competition.
