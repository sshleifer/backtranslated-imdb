Levant Victor Vargas is a movie that you definitely need to see. It was very heartfelt and had so much humor that makes you sucked right in. It's a lot like real life with what teens have to go through. Victor, an arrogant teenager, but with a good heart in the end deals with love in all the right places that deal with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use is actually using it as well. I recommend people watch this movie because it will be as if you were watching a real family. That's how you feel about this movie. A heart felt that moment was when Victor's grandmother gave a victory over something simple. Victor was really heartless and could not believe she would do something like that. It made me feel very sorry for him as if it were real. Overall I give this movie a B +
