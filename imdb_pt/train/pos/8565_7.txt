If you like animal movies, this movie will please. My wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially likes the parrot in this movie. It's child friendly, but I laughed with most of the humor. The character of French fashion made me laugh and add balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its happy and familiar appetite, but I like to leave the theater with a positive feeling.
