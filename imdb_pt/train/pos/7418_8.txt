"Shower" is a story about loyalty, about the uncontrollable advance of the modern world to the detriment of more traditional and more human ways of life. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his life in the big city, his wife and his retarded younger brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern versus old China. The public baths with their encounters, their cricket fights against the malls and the skyscraper. Many old men and women are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them is killing the other. <br /> <br /> Contest, touching, full of funny and enjoyable moments. The sensitive will cry and laugh alike. The actors are huge, especially the one who plays the retarded kid; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy, simple, letting the story flow by itself. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
