This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and, to a certain extent, I saw the lives of the villagers. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film just reflects exactly the same. Total credit to the director and the actor. They did a great job. I just wonder how movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go to Oscar and not to Doghi. I do not understand the criteria on which movies are selected. It's the money that makes the difference or having big names in the movie makes a difference. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more movies like this in the future.
