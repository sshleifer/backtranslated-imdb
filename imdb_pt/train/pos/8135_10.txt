I'm shocked. Shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you IMDB users who voted before me did not give this movie a rating higher than 7.7? - This is a C!. If I could give FOBH a 20, I'd be happy to do it. This film occupies the top of the pantheon of modern comedy, alongside Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most hilarious films of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you should see it !! If you do not know anything about rap - learn something !, and then watch it! Comparisons with 'Spinal Tap' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Watch and vote 10!
