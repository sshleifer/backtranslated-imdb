According to John Ford's fictional fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln, his biggest flaws may have been an obtuseness with his wife and the ability to dance "in the worst way." The Ford camera only praises points of view to reveal the beginning of Lincoln's life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities, it pays off in beauty and depth of vision. Strangely beautiful compositions from old films, what could have been a series of dazzling pictures, Ford has a unique eye to tell a story. The film sings the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously intelligent Lincoln on a taco, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film deals with two young men, brothers, being tried for a murder they both claim to have committed. In the classic style of the furious mob, the city decides to do justice with their own hands and lynch the two, until the honest Abe enters the fray. He delights them with his humor, telling them not to steal his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys' lawyer. What follows seems to become the sketch for all murder dramas - later leathers - when Abe astutely questions witnesses to the pleasure and humor of the judge, jury, and city before encountering the missing links. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds as many John Ford movies do: a tablespoon of Americana, a hint of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you are not sure whether to put into the recipe or whether the very Ford did it. Despite the overtly "Hollywood" sentiment of the film, and overly patriotic pranks alluding to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is totally enjoyable and pleasantly well built if you can take your drama with a grain of salt.
