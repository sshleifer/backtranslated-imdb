There seems to be no middle ground in this movie! Most happens in a dream and, like most dreams, is often silly and illogical. It is also a dazzling production, with great songs and great performances, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanette is insulted, unknowingly insults and several other faux pas at the reception of dreams are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she starts singing a chunk of Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a puppy for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - tremendously fun if you can get into the rhythm.
