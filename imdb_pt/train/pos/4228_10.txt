A top quality Columbus from start to finish. I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the killer, Ruth Gordon. As an avid fan of Columbus, I can not remember another one in which he did not set the killer in the end. does in other episodes. In this, while he is trying to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the "message" that his nephew left behind, he finally appears. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good. , as it is in many others.
