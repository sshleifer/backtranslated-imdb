I just watched "Kalifornia" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You would think that with the recent wave of serial killers movies, "Kalifornia" would be among some of the previous films. worthy of mention, but it has not. Maybe if this movie had been released sometime between 1996-1999, maybe it could have been more successful. In my opinion, "Kalifornia" is very different from most serial killers released in the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most current serial killers like "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies have shown a killer, but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to really learn anything about them. "Kalifornia" is a film that really tries to break through this barrier and really understand the criminal mind. He tries to answer questions like "Why do they do the things they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they like the thrill of killing?" some of the things Kalifornia tries to answer, but it also leaves room for us to try to figure things out for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression like Early Grayce. When we first meet at the beginning of the movie, we see that he is obviously a disturbed individual. When we see him for the first time, it's late at night. Early is possibly drunk. We then see him pick up a rock, throw it off a bridge, and then land on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is fierce in this movie. It's always good to see him when he plays psychopaths or really bad people. It's funny that this later would lead him to play a real nut like "12 Monkeys" and that he would be on the other side of the spectrum in "Seven" by David Fincher.
