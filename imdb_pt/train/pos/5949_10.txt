Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and memorable. Very good color film. Another film that I liked later was the High Society, with Bing Crosby. Wonderful song. Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
