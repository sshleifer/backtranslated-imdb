This is a nice little movie with a nice storyline, which plays the most important role throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It is a dramatic story quite intriguing, with also novel present in it. The story is being told slowly but this works very well for its development. The characters are cool and portrayed pleasantly by their actors. Usually I'm not much of an Asian-style fan, but the acting in that film was simply good. <br /> <br /> Of course the film is quite different in its approach and style from other genre films, produced in the west. In a way, this movie is already more advanced than the western films made at the same time. <br /> <br /> I just wanted the film to have a slightly better visual style. For a film that is considered a kind of art film, this film is certainly missing out on some very similar sequences. This was obviously a fairly cheap movie to do and was done quite generically. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevents this movie from being really distinctive and rising above the genre. <br /> <br /> But, oh, well, this movie is about its well-built story and characters that are in it. In this sense, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
