BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's an off-the-wall movie starring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two more lazy friends who create a sport on their driveway, which becomes a national sensation. Most jokes are really hilarious, but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "divert attention" from other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw in this movie is that the pace is very fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking "Wow is that over yet?" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continue to harass Squeak, who is a little horny guy. BASEketball is a comedy classic with some very quoting lines, and it's a lot of fun to watch!
