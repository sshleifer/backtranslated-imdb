Soapdish may fall as one of the most underrated films of all time. A stellar, selfless cast who understood exactly where the film was going and the roles they played in it. While everyone insisted, there was not a single superior. Kline showed intelligence and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to keep up a funny conversation while someone else was talking, I could go on. <br /> <br /> Do not pass this movie!
