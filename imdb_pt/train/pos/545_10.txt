Sequels hardly reach the original. This is definitely true in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, definitely give it a watch. Although camera work is lacking, Brian Krause's character is annoying, and the plot is click, it's a lot funnier than the first and that's what I find funny about it. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie expecting the same performance from the first film. Frankly, it's a bit different. Instead of sitting in his booth writing screenplays, Stanley is in Hollywood trying to direct his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a very different feel, but it's still great to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a 6 out of 10.
