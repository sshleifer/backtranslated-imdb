Wow baby, this is in fact a good Asian horror / gore, and a weird crazy movie. This is a Japanese splatterfest party that reminded me a little of Tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and courage there is a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they even dreamed of this visually stunning film, with some unique alien creatures infecting humans as parasites, turning them into partial machines or I think cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they take on a human is that they need to kill each other and eat the others. hmmm, yum yum. This would probably be called an industrial splatter or something, with an excellent soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also lends a bit of "The Thing" by Carpenter in the design and effects of the creatures. I would put it in the "must-have" category for the gorehounds, since there is a non-stop carnage and a very thin hemorrhage. And a must-have for stoners, because you do not even have to read the subtitles, the visual images alone are enough of a mental trip. The drawing of the little creatures that inhabit the human body as a fetus reminded me a little of the Frank Henenlotter films, which is another tribute to some great gothic movies with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a lot of fun for the gorehounds, no question about it, and I just loved it.
