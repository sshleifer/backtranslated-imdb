I see many people on this site wishing that the AG was released on DVD. I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, No More!) While it's great to have this terrific show in a boxed DVD format, I'm annoyed by the fact that they added very few in terms of "extras" (A commentary by Shaun Cassidy's director on the pilot episode ) and the episodes are displayed in the same order as they were displayed on the TV. Lost episodes that were never shown before being shown on the Sci Fi channel are in the box set, but are on the final DVD. If you buy the set of DVDs, get the actual request to view them and you will be happier. (You'll need to swap the DVD player to see it in order, but you'll be happy for it.)
