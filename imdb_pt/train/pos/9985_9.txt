I saw this movie in Winnipeg recently - appropriate, given the site used. I first read Lawrence's book in the 1970s, and for me it has always been a very powerful portrait of the trials of aging in our society. It resonated when I was young and resonates even more now. When the movie came out, I was eager to see if the story could survive. and was completely impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. She can give us a complete human being, even if the character is usually moody and critical - someone you would not want to live with. It's great to be able to see favorite characters coming to life so authentically.
