I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting game of "guess who". The film, however, needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the movie at first and sporadically throughout the rest. I always found that the new animated series did little justice to the new character Robin, much less Knightwing. This movie just continues this bad tradition. The film spends a lot of time in Bruce Wayne and his novel, which would not be so bad in a movie, if the novel was not so unbelievable. It's still a good movie if you're a fan of Batman and I recommend watching it.
