I see what my ancestors saw in young Bette Davis. She is splendid throughout this almost crazy political comedy that is actually starring Warren Williams as the political agent constantly in her boarding house. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as her ex, and I found myself rooting for her everywhere. The character of Williams is not at all nice, and he is not even an op. Decent. Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and appointed to be governor, in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, all this mess is generated by an internal political war in a party called "Progressive Party." If you're politically minded, you'll probably see a party different from the one with which you're affiliated, reflected in the fictional "Progressive Party" by Williams and Kibbee. I could draw exact parallels, but we are not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched some of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT THE SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll see Frank McHugh as Williams' right-hand man looking and behaving much like Bert Wheeler. He deceived me. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend it.
