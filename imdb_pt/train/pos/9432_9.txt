* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) decide to take a rafting trip on the Cahulawassee River before being flooded. <BR> They wanted to have fun, to have a good weekend in nature. <br /> <br /> But when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (Bobby), everything starts to go to Hell in a Handbasket, and this 'good weekend' goes to cost the life of a of the four ... <br /> <br /> 'Deliverance', which in Italian is stupidly titled 'Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura' ('A Calm Weekend Of Fear'), is the Grandad of films like "Massacre da Serra The Hills Have Eyes "," The Hills Have Eyes "," Wrong Turn "," Last House On The Left "and all other sub genre films" Evil Nature / Revenge ". Based on a book by James Dickey (which appears in the film as Sheriff Bullard), it's a chilling story about how one can get into a situation thinking he knows everything when he does not. <br /> <br /> And the image of the hand of the dead rising under the water, or the hands holding the rifle of the single leaf are haunted images that will never leave your mind. <br /> <br /> Liberation: 9/10.
