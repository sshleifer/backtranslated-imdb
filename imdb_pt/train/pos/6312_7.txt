Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they starred together in this film. George Clooney was also involved with this film as producer along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential, this also looks like a good fun project, which is in the same vein as the movie remakes like "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this movie is only half the success, or at least it's not. As good as it could have been. In the movie, his characters are being played by some well-known actors, but it's a shame that the characters do not have enough space to develop. Even though to their potential they could have turned into fun and entertaining characters, they are now just characters who have fun slightly because in most of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they are being touched does not change much for this, even if they prevent their characters from getting a bit annoying or maybe even annoying, or anything like that. <br /> <br /> Of course. due to the writing that the characters are not accustomed to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this movie does. The film depends a lot on its simple story and predictable way of telling stories. <br /> <br /> However, the film is still a lot of fun to watch, perhaps because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless movie, in which you simply should not worry too much about the story. In this regard, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works well and simply serves its purpose well. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you will not regret watching after you're done, but it's also a movie you can actually do without ever seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
