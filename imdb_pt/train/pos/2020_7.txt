CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad for this in a video. Then my sister found out that we had the book, so I read. I rented the video the same day I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable as was the book. The cast was brilliant.Tara Fitzgerald was excellent as Helen and Rupert Graves were as odious as Arthur. The costumes, music and scenery are unbelievably beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING: DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WATCH THIS. <br /> <br /> On the downside, there are some sex scenes that have been added and some violence. That's why the video is rated 15. There are a few other things that have been released. In part, I felt that the precision diminished. While the book is better than this, I'm glad to have seen it and recommend it to people who have read the book, are Bronte fans or dramas as costumes (I'm all 3!), As long as you are fast through sex scenes. The book is greatly underestimated. Anne Brontes' books do not seem to be as widely read or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, who have made it to television and movies several times. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion there was in it, but here they had eliminated all that! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
