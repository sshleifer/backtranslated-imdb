The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a Cuban citizen for five years, disappears from the face of the earth, leaving behind a sullen Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead when, in fact, he left Cuba. to move to Bolivia to live an assumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt and bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderberg starts where 'Che: Part One' is set aside (only this time better). The pace is more on target, the work of acting is always so good (including a turn of Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it is probably better for you to see the two films, to have the true story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I had the rare opportunity to see the two films in a display ---- talk about a long haul!) . As with "Che-Part 1: The Argentine," this film has no MPAA rating, but contains salty language and enough violence to easily cling to an "R".
