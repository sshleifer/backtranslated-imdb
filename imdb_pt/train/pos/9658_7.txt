"Come Undone" seems to elicit many opinions among the collaborators of this forum. It's true that it's a movie that promises a gay life, as most viewers expect, and it somehow escapes from that promise for an introspective view of a young man's soul. The movie has a way of staying with us even when it's over. It is a character study about how a young man engages in a love affair with someone so different from him that in the end will leave Mathieu confused, hurt and depressed when things do not go according to what he expected the relationship to be if did not see the movie, maybe want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, the director of the film, told his story Point of view of Mathieu. Most viewers seem to be disoriented by the different moments of the film, but there are clues that are not obvious, as you can see, in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that may add to the way some people watch the movie. This is a story about the condemned love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the final collapse of his life together. <br /> <br /> First, Cedric, the handsome young local, chases Mathieu until he can convince him he likes him. Mathieu is also attracted to Cedric. We see how different young men are, the way Cedric tells Mathieu's family how he thinks school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric took him. We watch when Mathieu, reading the guide book, wants Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu approaches her mother, she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing her career. She also points out the future they would both have together, which proves to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson the hard way. He passes into an uncertain life with Cedric and tries to take his own life. We watched him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The ending may be confusing for most viewers, but there is a time in the movie when Mathieu goes to work in a bar. where we see him washing his glasses and looking closely at Pierre, the young man who frequents the bar. That is why, when Mathieu looks for Pierre in his house, it seems difficult to imagine. However, we have seen how Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling in the sand, has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them while they watch an apparently lost boy, but then realize that their father is around. <Br> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand on a simple level. Mathieu suffered greatly, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and the loss of Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has already been seen in other major French films, is equally as good as Cedric Shallow. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" shares opinions, the film deserves a vision because of the complexity and care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story.
