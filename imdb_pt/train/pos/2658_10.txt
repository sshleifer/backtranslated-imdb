Kubrick again shows his incredible ability to create a perfect setting for a movie. Mostly through cinematography but also using an ingenious trail, it creates a creepy, sinister tone that resides throughout the film and leaves my shiver down my spine from the start. It really is that perfect environment that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course, it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrait of a maddened mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be good, but it's easy to look beyond these two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. In addition, it presents the actor with the biggest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
