I liked this movie. Was pretty cool. It has everything: cars, gunshot, wrestling and even a symbolic girl. It does not stand out in any of that, except for the cars. A little bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of kissing around, and a lot of car, with a big chase near the end. The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at IMDB is possible, so the film is not as bad as people are painting. It has some quality and I like to see. Actually, I loved the movie. And I did not have to turn off my brain to watch. I was not always thinking "Is that possible?" or a bum. 9 out of 10.
