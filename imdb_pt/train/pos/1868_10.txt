This movie describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst of circumstances, but unlike many people, he grew to be a respectable person. What's more is that this is a true story. Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and has never played with women, coke, cigars, marijuana, alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in places where he was growing up. <br /> <br /> There's not much else to say about this movie, it's great. The only rating I can give is a 10/10.
