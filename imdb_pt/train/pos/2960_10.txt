Well, the main reason I tuned in to watch this movie is because it was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone from South Park. However, as soon as the movie started the laughter began to erupt from my belly. From subtle gestures to a joke, to the cheeky humor of the bathroom, along with a steady reliance on some very witty insinuations. This movie can ruin the event he faces the face of man's poker, let alone his underwear poker. Some of the funniest flashing and you will miss the jokes already portrayed in Hollywood along with the constant criticism of themselves in the bargain. <br /> <br /> I'll just show that not only is Trey Parker adept at writing he's not very poor at the old acting game either. I was surprised by how much I was absorbed in this movie. However, I am very concerned that it is not available to buy over the internet here in the UK. Separate the boys! <br /> <br /> I am, and will continue to show all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny parts, and occasionally sniffing my beer. All in all an excellent movie, if you are an unnecessary comedy fan. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about silly or rude things steer clear of course! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could make you go through these prejudices.
