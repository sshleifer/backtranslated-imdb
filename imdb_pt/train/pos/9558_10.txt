So I consider myself very big on the anime scene, with very few shows that I just will not watch. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the most original series to date, has almost everything I could ask for. A parallel story, so to speak, about unconditional love that will NOT be admitted, a very blatant comedy and a very well done dubbing cast (Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If not for the terribly funny aspect, it would be just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I noticed, "love or hate", very few people I saw introduced to this series will end up with an aversion to it. <br /> <br /> Originally for the core, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet the house in this series. I am ready to assure you that you will have fun.
