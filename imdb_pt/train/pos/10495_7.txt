Saving Grace is a good movie to watch on a boring afternoon when you're looking for something other than regular scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana in it is crazy! It was the first movie I watched with this theme (drugs / marijuana) that is not really criticizing, just making jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who imagined having some money saved for her, finds that she needs to pay all her debts in debt to avoid losing all her things, especially her house she loves so much. She has never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener who is very fond of smoking marijuana, decides to partner with her in selling marijuana on a large scale.
