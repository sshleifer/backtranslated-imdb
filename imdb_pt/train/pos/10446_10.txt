I watched this movie 10 years ago. and watch it on video, on average, once a year since then. is the kind of movie that is timeless because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversations are very personal. is also one of the few movies that capture you from frame one to the end of the credits, despite the fact that there are actually only two (very engaging) characters. this owes much to the engaging performance of hawke and delpy, which make us believe that they are, in fact, jesse and celine. This is also the first movie I saw mentioned reality show, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! I love the way this movie just engages the audience in your space, and makes you think, no matter how tired you are, that you're one of those characters. also made me want to ride a train through Europe! I have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe this will tell me, my friends or just the genius of the movie.
