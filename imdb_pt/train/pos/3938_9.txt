Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we had long believed Abraham Lincoln was. You're a fool. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a hickory from the inside. But through your confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the judicial process, you can see that beneath the outer postures is a bright man who has a good grasp of what is going on around him and how to influence people to his around. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a good notion of how to present humor. It's one aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes, he has a perfect timing. There is a sequence in the trial that made me laugh a lot. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous symbolic storm of the Civil War. . It goes forward in history. The movie is fiction, but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous. Definitely worth seeing again.
