Family problems abound in real life and that's what this movie is all about. Love can keep members together through trials and trials and that's what this movie is all about. A man, Dad, has the maturity and strength to support the family in the face of adversity. Children grow up, one is all, the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a father is, the father still loves his children and is willing to provide them with a cushion when they fall. ALL actors who play their characters have made remarkable performances. Yes, I shed a tear along the way, knowing that I had similar experiences, both as a young adult and then as a parent. This is true for life, something that every young adult, and father, would do well to see, though some do not realize it until they are also parents. A must see for those who care about their families.
