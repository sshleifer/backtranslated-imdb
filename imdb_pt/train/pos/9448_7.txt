This was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. The first part of the film, though strange, has a light and fun quality. The journey begins with a note so peaceful, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the Appalachian hills. But this is misleading beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the villagers are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain and trembling at the thought. Lewis's leg made me shudder. However, while the film is generally very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral or right to take the life of another individual? What morality can lead us to do, or not, in some cases? And is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions may be drawn from the film, it is an achievement in itself (despite certain aspects that were terribly real and horrible).
