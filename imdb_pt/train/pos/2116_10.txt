Was there ever a more charming movie than that? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of actors actually seems to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. The core of this is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not get along face to face, but who connect completely anonymously as correspondence partners. But there are also supporting characters and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail," the recent update of "Shop"), they are not just prepared to support both leads and their needs. Everyone becomes an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. One of the most exciting scenes in movie history comes when the almost tragic Frank Morgan seeks, casually and humbly, someone to have a Christmas dinner. A must see! **** outside of ****
