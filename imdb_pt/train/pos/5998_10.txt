The Cure is an incredible movie ... So full of suspense and so REAL! I was fortunate enough to attend a screening of 'The Cure' at its New York premiere and this completely amazed me! I also heard that he won a prize from that particular festival, and definitely deserved it. The first thing that impressed me was cinematography. Eric Giovon did an incredible job. The filming style of the love scene in the middle of the movie was incredible. A love scene was needed in this film, and Jafri understood, but it also kept the scene tasteful. Giovon and Jafri form an excellent creative team and should definitely work together on future projects. Judy Maier's narration was so surreal, but at the same time painful, it made me feel what the main character felt. I'm a very tough critic, but I must say The Cure is one of my favorite movies..JUST LOVE IT! If you have not seen it yet, check it out!
