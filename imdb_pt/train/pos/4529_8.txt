As is well known among long-haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in Herr Graf's silent speeches, during the summer the aristocrats like to travel to unique and distinctive places in order to avoid the heat, as well as hordes of rude people calming down . These bizarre trips around the world also happen in "Three Ages," a charming and elegant silent work run by veterans, Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. Obviously, this German count liked the first segment focused on the Stone Age, due to the affinity that aristocrat feels in relation to that old time. preferring that the second segment which occurs during the glory of Rome (should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman empire, ie the barbarians, or the same thing, the Germans). It is clear that the third segment occurs during modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern. The leitmotiv that moves Herr Keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious events during three different ages is the search for love, a very complicated subject to understand for the aristocrats who prefer the quest for money and self-interest. Every time "Three Ages" is shown at the Schloss theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a funny and witty silent film (even for a serious German count), a play full of jokes and trinkets, puns, falls and acrobatics, tricks visual and surprising technicians, an absolute quiet delicatessen that is perfect to allow the severe severity of summer to endure. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily withdraw my license because this German earl must flirt with an old Teutonic heiress who does not seem to be old. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
