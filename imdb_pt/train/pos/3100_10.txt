By the end of the first hour, my chin was comfortably between my feet. The movie never, and I mean never, lets it into action. It may be a light action, but it is action. Again, all cast members fit perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were possible and the fight was incredible. Matt Damon will always be Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and that's no exception. The action, the bets, the plot. How they do it I'll never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screen for each of these films. Because if he had not done a great job with the first movie, we would not have to talk about it. <br /> <br /> So, do not go to theaters, try the theaters. if it's still where you live, but if it's not on December 11, Bourne will come home to you!
