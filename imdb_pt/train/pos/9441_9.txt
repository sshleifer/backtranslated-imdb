The creators of this great film did a great job engaging you with the characters as they suffered from this horrible ordeal. The horrible scene in the forest was made so superb that you forget that these men were just actors, playing parts. I've never been so immersed in a movie like this one. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight have never been better on the screens as well as good performances by Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and although he only appeared briefly, James Dickey the Man who wrote the book on which the film is based, as the sheriff of Aintry. It's a little disturbing, and the kids, of course, should be protected from it, but that's great, dramatic cinema.
