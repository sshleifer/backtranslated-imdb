I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss the lines. I knew it looked like it would be nice, but it was a lot funnier than I thought it would be. I liked Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed very strange as normal people, if that makes sense. I get sick of movies that show teenagers being like cookie cutters, like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique, but still very human and normal enough to relate. I'll be recommending this movie to all my friends and looking forward to it on DVD, go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see him again in the theater and I will not see things more than once very often.
