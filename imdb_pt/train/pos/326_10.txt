"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" is a lot of fun. As at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing loudly. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, explorer. Do not expect Bergman here. This film is about a youth in the early 1960s in Sweden and on the issues, read * contradictions * that the nation and the world were facing. Sometimes Yellow seems to be a serious social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing ordinary people and politicians (eg, Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts like a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her home life, her love affairs, her political views, her view of herself. Is she a complete person? complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And put on all this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his team documenting themselves documenting Lena. This is what, for me, really gives yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very funny moments and in funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. I remember a Bjork music video with that same quality? a videoclip about creating a video clip, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more caricatured. I think Sjöman may have something similar in mind. While "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly clever, witty, refreshing, effervescent and authentic.
