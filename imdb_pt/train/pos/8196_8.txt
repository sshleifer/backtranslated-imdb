I do not know why people think this is such a bad movie. It has a very good plot, a good action and the change of location for Harry does not hurt either. Of course some of their offensive and free, but this is not the only movie like that. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as the small town cop. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this, it is much better than the dead pool. 4/5
