Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work in the popular magazine Sharpe, hoping to live his dream life, but struggles to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on American Business Survival, this comedy drama received divergent opinions from critics. Labeled as inconsistently funny, but with charm by the actors, as losing friends seemed like a run of the fish mill out of the pond having fun in another culture comedy, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 The image works on behalf of its actors and the story is simple but clear. We started in the past, then in the present, and we're working to see how Young made his mark in one of America's leading magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is very nice to words. Whether hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his helper the nature of the law, the English actor brings a charm and a light heart to every scene. Here, when the script is good, but far from its own standards, it brings a lot of energy to the image and only it is worth noting. His pranks with "Babe 3" are unforgivable things, simply breathtaking, as well as his exuberant dance, but he does splendidly. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson do well to portray the heads of stereotyped magazines in which Dunst fits. well to confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotypical movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a photo about Mother Teresa is as laughable as the pranks of her character in the pool. To emphasize the point there is a dog, and Pegg completes this in the true British-style comedy with a great turnaround. <br /> <br /> Although a British film exists an adaptation of the American way of life for Young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to storytelling. Young wants the right side of his foot to be contrasted with American professionalism. The inclusion of modern tabloid stars will soon make this film dated, but the concept of exploring movie stars gives this advantage. <br /> <br /> Weide's first picture is not perfect. There are lapses of concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an obvious and awkward twist and there are many characters to be needed. Physical comedy can also be exaggerated. As a side note, the writing errors on the DVD are some of the best you've seen, which are almost half an hour in length. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama has Simon Pegg in brilliant shape again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy, is worth watching.
