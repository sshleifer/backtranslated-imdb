Yes, it's an art ... to successfully make a slow-paced thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in good volumes, while you do not even notice it happening. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the film may seem unnecessary and probably affect how much you enjoy the movie. However, the main plot is very interesting. The movie does not rush you and still grabs you enough to make you think. The direction is good. The use of lights to achieve the desired effects of suspense and unexpectedness is good. <br /> <br /> Very good 1 time clock if you are looking to lie down and listen to an exciting tale!
