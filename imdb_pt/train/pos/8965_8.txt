Made in the same year as "Vertigo", this is an equally fascinating film, albeit in a much lighter vein. She's in New York haunted during the winter: Kim Novak is a witch casting a spell on James Stewart, but gets stuck in it. The interesting thing is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who originated the role of Madge in "Picnic" on Broadway (the part Novak would make famous in the film).
