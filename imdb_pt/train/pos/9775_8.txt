Kali's Tears is an original but imperfect horror film that investigates the feats of a cult group in India composed of German psychologists who have learned to control their wills and their bodies to the point of causing others to be "healed" radical techniques (which can trigger nightmare hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to release the repressed demons within them. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a series of vignettes about Taylor-Eriksson's group - the cult group mentioned above. The first segment is a bit slower than the rest, but it serves well to set the premise for the rest of the movie. The rest unfolds like a mindf @ ck movie with some of the major clips played in the mix (complete frontal nudity, some blood) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I say check this out. It may not be spectacular, but its concept is very neato and delivery in the right places. 8/10
