When I heard about "Hammerhead" being released on DVD and finally found in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image". Those guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap B-Pictures but a lot of fun in recent months, but also some very disappointing films. So I did not expect much, especially after watching the disappointing "Shark Zone" a few days before. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be a great revival of the 1950s monster movies. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and maidens in danger, plant eaters and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for a fun monster movie. The only thing missing is graphic sex and nudity you've come to expect in such movies, but since the movie was made for TV, it's understandable that these scenes are missing. And it does not matter anyway, because "Hammerhead" is action and terror entertainment at its best. There are two reasons why I gave him seven of ten points, however: First of all, the monster is not seen very often and confrontation with the creature's destruction is very fast and poorly done, and secondly, William Forsythe just is not the right guy for the "hero" and for falling in love with the cute Hunter Tylo. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie to any fan of monster movies out there. Grab a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
