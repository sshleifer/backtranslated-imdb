Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment, which not only told a very interesting story but also tried to do something different with the genre "biopic". Che: Part Two is the culmination of this excellent experiment. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the same attributes of the first, from extraordinary performances (especially of Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant direction of Steven Soderbergh, not forgetting his intention to break with the conventional rules of the biography. which I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they are successful most of the time. <br /> <br /> The final message of this movie is perfect, and includes everything we have. It was said about the life of Che Guervara. The only flaw I found in Che: the second part is that some parts seemed a bit irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, like the first one, it is a brave and fascinating expert who challenges the viewer and leaves us thinking.
