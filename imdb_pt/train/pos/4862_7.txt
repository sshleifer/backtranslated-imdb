This musical is decidedly mixed, and none of the elements really fits, but somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable. The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of its virtues, though he co-wrote the screenplay. The songs, though charming, have nothing to do with this particular movie, and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen do what they usually do with plenty of competence, but the tone of the rest of the movie is missing at about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are some highlights. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers that it is a talkie and stops assaulting like a silent actor. And there are some writing snippets that could only have been written by Wodehouse, although most of the film looks like the production of one of the Hollywood encounters he later parodyed.
