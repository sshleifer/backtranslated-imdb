This is by far the biggest stand up show ever. I've seen several stand up shows, participated in several stand up shows and watched Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone who could match Murphy's skills in this show. The prints are great, the skits are great and the timing is perfect. You might even say that the crowd really likes it. When he did Raw a few years later, it was also very good, but this is # 1 in my book. It also shows that at the same time, particularly in the early to mid eighties, that Murphy was funny. My favorite parts of the show is when he is recounting the family barbecue and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! Ice cream is coming !!!!" Another great part is where your mother is like Clint Eastwood.
