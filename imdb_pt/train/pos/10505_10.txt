Yes that's right. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange-looking controller were designed so that this game could be done. It was amazing the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. The game controller is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and it has that charm of Nintendo that is always so intangible but undeniably there. One must have for any N64 owner and one reason to get one N64 for all others.
