According to this advice, I think you love or hate. Usually, as with all movies. No need to be angry with others. All we are doing here is giving opinions. I rented this movie last night and want to come and cast my opinion on the mix. I was surprised at how many people are struggling. There is a difference between a movie fan and a fan of horror movies. I'm a fan of horror movies. Most movie buffs do not like horror movies. So many low-cost movies that look like movies are coming out these days. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it hard to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review on "Hood of the Living Dead" because it is very good compared to the rest of the trash out there. It's nothing special, but it's those horror filmmakers who try to be too serious to end up making a horrible horror movie. I really liked this one. Are you telling me there is no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you all have all those huge DVD collections that you're so proud of, nothing but Major Motion Pictures, right? Nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to appreciate the low budget independently. I knew what I was getting when I watched this movie. I will not be upset because I thought it would be a 100 million dollar movie. Some of you may need to watch the Matrix again and again and stop trying to compare everything to the Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, that explains it all. Good movie people, check it out.
