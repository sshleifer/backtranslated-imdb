This - not a certain overrated Southern Soap Opera - was the biggest epic to come out of the biggest Hollywood year in 1939. I will not reassure the obvious - Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. gives superb comedic performances.However, I want to note two other less understood elements of this masterpiece. The final battle sequence Magnificent, as the wonderful Sam Jaffe laboriously climbs to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his horn and warn the regiment, is simply grandiose. It never fails to captivate me. Another underrated element in the film is the performance of Eduardo Ciannelli as the Guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a well-crafted, articulate, historically informed villain ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander the Great"). In fact, one can see parallels between this mystical and malignant nationalist and a certain well-known figure of the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi treaty? Not really. But still, a tremendous epic, fun and exciting.
