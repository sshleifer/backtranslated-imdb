I thought it was a great movie for kids between 6 and 12 years old. A little mellow, but the story is cheery. This proves that a teenager's dreams can really come true. I think it's a great story for any child who is depressed, or it feels like they're trying to juggle a lot of things between them. Very beautiful movie. Angry.
