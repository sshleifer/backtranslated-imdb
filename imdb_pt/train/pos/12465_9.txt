I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very exciting read (unintentional pun). It's not too difficult to read for those who do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture more of the passion of relationships than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne, I could relate to this book and movie. Very few Australian women writers were around the 1970s, so very little is documented about the way of life of a woman in an urban city in Australia during that era or class. It is a precious piece of Melbourne history. It's a shame that it's documented as some kind of soft 80's porn movie. It's far from that and as the other reviewer mentioned please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent what the movie is about anything. Those who rent the movie based on this description will be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was made in 1982, so do not expect the Hollywood dramatization that they seem to embody these days. That's what I like. It's also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she's just fantastic as Nora and it's great to see her really acting, because if you're close to my age, you'd better remember her for her plays at Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid this talent? This movie will give you a whole new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
