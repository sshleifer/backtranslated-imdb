Okay, where do I start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was perfect. James Cahill did it for himself. Initially, after a first preview, I was disappointed not to have seen it on the silver screen. However, this was before exploring many DVD features !!!! Oh my god Jakes Cahill from the movie review was almost as flawless as his acting. He told of the industry secrets used in the movie that you only get from experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the other actors. The scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue (porn) movies. I'm certainly with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel. <br /> <br /> I am still impressed with every visualization of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the board indicating the location of the library in place. school ... and possibly the guy playing a retard! All in all a timeless classic and the best movie to leave Europe in years! where my Oscar at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
