It is notable that for the support players of 'Young Mr. Lincoln', Ford has lesser known actors and others less than stars. This not only increases the focus of his film on Lincoln's central character, but also gives the public a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man involved, as each of us is inexorably in matters and feelings of their time and seeking the way to solve them. It is not so much through the words and actions of Fonda, but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln's worldview, sense of place in society and politics, and how people responded The words and the acts of Mr. Lincoln and placed their trust in this man whom they considered deserving their respect and attention. <br /> <br /> Try: Instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, the next time you see 'Young Mr. Lincoln' shifts his focus to the supporting characters - I hope you are generously rewarded with a more enjoyable appreciation I like to suspect that Ford's narrative through the reactions of the supporting characters to Fonda's Lincoln may have attracted David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in 'Doctor Zhivago' in which are the reactions of the characters of support to Zhivago who really talk about Zhivago.
