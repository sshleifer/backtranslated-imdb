Years ago, many major studios promoted serial movies that were shown in movie theaters among real features along with a newscast of current events as well as cartoons, especially on a Saturday afternoon. "The Return of Chandu" was a series of 12 episodes where Chandu, (Bela Lugosi), "The Mysterious Mr. Wong", '34 is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of Lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of Egypt, (Nadji) Maria Alba, "House of Horrors of Dr. Terror", '43. Princess Nadji is held captive by Ubasti's cult of black magic, which she believes is a reincarnation of her long-dead goddess Ossana. These 12-episode sitcoms take you back in time and are beautifully produced, considering we're talking about 1934!
