The story: On Texel Island, photographer Bob, who takes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. His free spirit and life longing intrigue Bob, who suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Your life is not as simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob engages in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to gain her trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds well, although it remains somewhat on the surface and would have been nice if the character 'psychology' would have been worked out a bit more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates your choices? This is what gives depth to a movie and something to think about as I see it. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even if the characters pass enough to justify it. So you do not know the characters at this deeper level. The actors deliver a good job and play in a very natural and "convincing" way, but I think it would be better if the film were played by a younger actress, since the naivety of this character does not work for an adult. woman. The camera work is good, and there are some great photos of nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.
