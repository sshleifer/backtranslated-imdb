Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, The Rostov Ripper, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation was obstructed by the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. He does the work in such a brilliant way that he will not leave anyone untouched. At first, it may be a bit slow, but it actually grabs you as the story unfolds. I can only say that, next to "The Silence of the Innocents", this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to tell what the performance of the actor stands out in the rest of this film. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him is as remarkable as Rea. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character that inspires more empathy than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, overwhelmed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his co-workers ... He is tortured, ashamed as well as extremely cruel. <br /> I can only recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in a well-done docu-drama where the actors are even more important than the special effects. It deserves at least a 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
