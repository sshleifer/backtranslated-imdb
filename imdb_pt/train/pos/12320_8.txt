Sinnui yauman, is undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories ever made on film. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a depressed young man who goes in search of a monastery to stay in the middle of the forest, a place that locals seem to be afraid to get close to. The journey alone is dangerous with wolves, and a mad Taoist monk lives in the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young woman who also lives in the vicinity of a desert temple. She is forced to seduce men by her wicked lover, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of idiot, but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the forest, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the forest. There are great martial arts, even a monk who begins to sing drunkenly while performing Taoist sword forms. The film does many acrobatics of traditional martial arts films, with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film truly flows, and everything is effective. <br /> <Tsing is to marry an evil tree monster, which can not be good, and we feel his situation in his house, where we find his sisters and stepmother who are not really cool. <br /> <br /> They must fight a witch with a deadly tongue, and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight an age-old evil to save their souls, and bring Ling's ashes back to their home for a proper burial so that she may have a chance of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to detail. One is touched in many ways by this movie, you laugh, you cry and you simply have fun with great martial arts and cinematography. And although in the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin run away in the morning sun under a lovely rainbow, we never know if Tsing had a reincarnation, but we know her.
