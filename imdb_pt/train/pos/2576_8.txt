I'm from "Christopher Reeve Generation," it's fair to say he was the best actor to play Superman, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors on paper, and George Reeves makes a good offer to beat Chris off the top, although it is hardly enough. That does not stop me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot to do with it. It has everything a movie needs, a plot with beginning, middle and end, plus all these parts being intelligently written. The film is daring both in acting and in plot, something a film noir but with tights. The story is thrilling and meaningful, it's a movie with a message that is not very preaching. I'm still amazed that this was done in 12 days, oh, the glory days of Hollywood when we did not have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into the hell of development ... The film is polished and skillfully made, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for driving with speed and efficiency. It never lets the restrictions of technology diminish, in fact, there are some creative things done to create the effect of flight, including putting a camera in a boom in a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we're seeing it from the point of view of Superman, also some close-ups of George in the process of working, and a long shot at an animated superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an extra feature in the first season of the television series George Reeves. A DVD that is worth owning by itself, the inclusion of the film as its all original, is the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood Today God Bless!
