Excellent documentation. I personally remember this growth in New York in the early 80's. This movie is for anyone who was not around during that time period. It shows the one thing the Afro-American Gay Underclass thought was solely theirs and that the love and the camadrie you see are real. People are real and, unfortunately, few are still alive while it is being written. The balls are still safe, but not to the extent they were in the eighties. This time is gone forever. This is a good pre film "homo bandit". When the Queens were really proud of being outgoing. Goodbye to Storyville This is another era, but very documented in all hail movies!
