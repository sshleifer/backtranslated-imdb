I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I have not been interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on an h-game, which I'm not sure if it was done before or not, I did not play the game, but from what I heard it follows very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series a 10/10. There's a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've ever seen. It also has great Japanese music too! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, check it out. You can find subbed episodes on some anime sites out there, it's straight from Japan.
