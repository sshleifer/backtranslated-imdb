I stumbled on this series by accident. After half an episode, I got hooked. American Gothic was an obscure and bizarre series with Gary Cole as the mysterious and probably bad Sheriff Buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son, Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the sinister sheriff of Gary Cole and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb was able to face Sheriff Buck, one of the scariest characters ever created for a TV series. I have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you are not lucky enough to see Lucas in American Gothic, see him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a remarkable spectacle, with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during the short term.
