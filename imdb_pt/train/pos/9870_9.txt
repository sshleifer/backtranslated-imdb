With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million, the people of Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios did an incredible job. <br /> <br /> They combined state-of-the-art digital animations, perfectly cast vocal talents from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining family movie with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and affection for his flock companions. And how sometimes many different creatures are needed to form a herd. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I received a strong political message about living with the people who share their space - maybe it should be necessary to see for all the world leaders! David Newman - another member of the Newman family of Hollywood songwriters - provides an excellent track that is not intrusive, but serves to take action forward and is sometimes toe playing positively. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the movie is incredible; a fantasy land of snow, geysers, mud, stones and intensely colorful and strangely believable ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Man's 'Manfred' being a special treat. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as the Dumb as DoDo comes from. 'This is a good family movie that holds things that could alarm or scare practically sanitized kids - but still real ones. <br /> <br /> A great movie to see in the theater and to buy home.
