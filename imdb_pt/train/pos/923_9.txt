I've never seen it on TV, but I rented the DVD from Netflix as soon as I discovered it was available. I had high expectations, and was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is great. That level of quality I would only expect from movies, so I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews about this. Maybe the DVD release has improved the animation? A bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to watch the two versions of the pilot. I am an adult, and I really appreciate it being for adults. It's not just kids who like cute cartoon characters. It is by no means "cheeky" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents would not want their young children to see it. I am very disappointed to have been canceled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
