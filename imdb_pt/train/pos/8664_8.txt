Steely, the powerful supreme gangster Frankie Diomede (the ever formidable Lee Van Cleef in his rude form) was arrested and sent to jail for him to rub a traitorous partner without detection. Lowbrowing pretentious and wiseguy Tony Breda (a lovely portrait of Tony Lo Bianco) is also arrested. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank out of the group and helps him in his quest to take revenge on a rival gang of mobsters led by the relentless Louis Annunziata (played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbing screenplay by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, reports the story at a steady pace, sustains an appropriate, but occasionally unconcerned tone, and stages the action-packed pieces with considerable finesse (a awkward and uncomfortable shower with a mondo destructed chase rate as the exciting highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco exhibit a nice, loose and engaging chemistry on the screen; The relationship between the characters is alternately fun and touching. The mind-boggling Edwige Fenech does not have much to do as Tony's crying girlfriend, Orchidea, but at least he discovers her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much appreciated free shower scene. The syncopated, pulsating and syncopated funk / jazz sound of Riz Ortolani certainly reaches the point of soulfully swinging. The polished cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is equally impressive. A little winner really cool and fun.
