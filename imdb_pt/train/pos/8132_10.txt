I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it about six years ago and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I'll admit, you'll probably despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap. But if you are a fan of rap, even if casual, you will love the jokes and internal references. One of the best lines of the film is about the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use that line today and I get lots of laughs with it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played the nerd Lamar in "Revenge of the Nerds". It is unfortunate that this movie will probably never be released on DVD.
