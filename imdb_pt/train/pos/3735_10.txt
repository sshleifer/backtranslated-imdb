Really moving story of a recruiting camp in America where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. Human study has always attracted me when it comes to war films, because it translates personal and subjective opinions about war, opposed wartime films where action and technical data are being analyzed to the detriment of the human factor . <br /> <br /> The film manages to take a new twist on an old subject, and manages to distance itself from the usual war films, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the standpoint of the traditional standard. The film focuses on Bozz's tragic character, which avoids being sucked into by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to relinquish control over his destiny and fight for something he does not believe in, spends his energy on finding ways to avoid being sent to the outside, both for himself and his comrades, and ironically ends up finding his just reason to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> The acting is really exceptional, and documentary-style footage almost makes you feel transposed to the movie. In addition, the film will provide food for thought for those enthusiastic about action in usual war films or war game enthusiasts, hopefully stirring up some minds of a generation that has happily escaped the terror of being summoned.
