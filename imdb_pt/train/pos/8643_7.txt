This was a scary movie. <br /> Brad Pitt deserved an Oscar for it. <br /> <br /> A traveling novelist (played by David Duchovny, famed for X-Files) and his girlfriend two hitch-hikers (Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt) on their way to California. On the way they stop in the infamous scenes of serial killers to photograph the scenes of a new book in which the character of Duchovny is working, little they know that the most disturbed serial killer of the history of the country is sitting next to them in the same car.
