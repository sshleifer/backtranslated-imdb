Have you ever heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon? You have? It was set in a world made up entirely of small islands floating above the clouds, and the heroes had to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey? Did the water flow upward and the remnants of large cities levitated on the horizon? I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> I stumbled on this movie by accident and I'm so glad I did! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Much like the Pixar films, it's a computer-animated piece of art that could only be possible in today's world. The animators have invested in almost everything that appears on the screen, and that attention to detail is staggering (the scene in which the foreground mushrooms emit green smoke while the characters walk distracted in the background is one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully realized and wonderful to watch in action. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not entirely unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. Our protagonists are friendly and interesting, ensuring that the public is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that otherwise could devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the character who will most fall in love. A little blue creature with a wacky smile and a tendency to speak a mixture of absurd and English, Hector offers relief from comedy in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. <br /> <br /> In summary, I recommend watching The Dragon Hunters if you get the chance. Pay attention to the incredible animation, breathtaking battle scenes and glimpses of a world unlike anything you've ever seen on a movie or television screen. At the very least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine (which, actually, I am)!
