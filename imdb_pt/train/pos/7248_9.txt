When I saw the Terminators of the year 3000 for the first time, I had no expectations for the movie. Although it was not as bad as I thought. It is a sort of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story are Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of zombie meat eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror films: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see that boy in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi as John Robbins and in the Cannibal apocalypse. like the role of the brother of Mary. Very entertaining movie, with some boring parts.
