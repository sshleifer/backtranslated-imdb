Not having seen the movie at the original theater launch, I was surprised when the DVD arrived, as this movie did not have the wide distribution it deserved. <br /> <br /> The directorial debut of Denzel Washington and the finished product have nothing. envy other films on the same theme by more talented directors. The film has a very professional look. This shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot from the other side of the camera. It brings a different angle to this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things the film has is undoubtedly the good presentation of Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right guidance, will go far without a doubt. His opinion on the troubled young man, at this point in his life, in turmoil and suffering for a bad life, so far handled it, is quite true. His Antwone is a beautiful portrait of a suffering man who is basically very good and has a lot to give, but no one seems to see this side of his character. At the worst moment of his despair Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, if somewhat moderate way. Because of the anguish in Antwone, he misses the opportunity to open up to this man, who wants to help, but because of the restrictions placed in his office, it is enough to do three sessions and then dismiss his patient. <br /> Things work, as Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse he suffers at the hands of Mrs. Tate, his foster mother, is brutal to say the least. The attempt on the part of an older woman at Tate's house of sexual abuse gives Antwone a bitter taste that remains with him throughout his adult life, as he was marked by the shame he carries with him. Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see a different world for the love she and the support she gives him. <br /> <br /> The main performances are really good. Dr. Davenport of Denzel Washington also has his own problems. He is not a happy camper either. He can help Antwone, but he can not help himself, or his relationship with a worshiper. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a good Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a great actress, is superb as Mrs. Tate, the abusive adoptive mother. <br /> <br /> Antwone's reunion with his unknown family is a bit sugary and sentimental, but of course, if it is to believe that Fisher finds happiness, then finally you have to accept that part of the film as well.
