I have no idea how to describe this movie, and would also like to give others the same opportunity I had - seeing it without prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it immensely, but I can also say that I misunderstood what was happening, if indeed there was anything to understand in the first place. Fans of David Lynch (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin's films should particularly like this, and any fan of the EIGHTBALL comic book will probably be beside themselves with joy and admiration (it came as close as any movie I've seen to the tone and The humor of Dan Clowes creates so effectively. <br /> <br /> A little note just to warn anyone who gets offended easily - this film, if rated, would be NC-17 for sure. male, however ... hmm, well ... yes.this is a strange and wild thing.
