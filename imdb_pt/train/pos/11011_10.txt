One of RKO Radio's biggest funders, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers for a school for bombers. O'Brien and Scott discuss teaching methods while their students dispute the affections of Anne Shirley. O'Brien's methods are solid during a bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but the mortally wounded Scott manages to fire a gas truck, providing a perfect target for his fellow bombers. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war movies, with moments of subtle pungency (the death of trainee Eddie Albert) alternating with scenes of ridiculous melodrama "Yellow Danger" (the Japanese literally whistle with their teeth as they torture defenseless Americans). ). Although it can not help but seems dated today, Bombardier remains a fun propaganda effort (the movie is sometimes mistakenly listed as the debut of Robert Ryan, who actually appeared in front of the cameras since 1940.) <br />> Anyone interested in getting a copy of this movie, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
