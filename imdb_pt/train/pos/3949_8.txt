Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once when it was first televised in 1971. Certain scenes linger in my memory and a general feeling of restlessness is how I remember being affected by it. I would be fascinated to see you again if it has already been made available for the home video. Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone would agree that the basic configuration of the plot and the characters could have been derived from a video. 1960 The British film, originally titled City of the Dead, renamed the Horror Hotel for the American release? There are some similarities also with a later British film, The Wicker Man. One detail remains with me years after seeing the film. It's a small but significant moment, near the beginning of the movie. As I recall, a minister and his wife stopped to help some people by the side of the road, around 1870, somewhere in the west. The nice Ray Milland presents to you and your (daughter?) Yvette Mimieux a beautiful young mute woman. While the preacher is assisting Ray Milland with the cart, a rattlesnake appears and snakes menacingly, unseen by any of the characters except for Yvette Mimieux. She does not look frightened, but looks at the snake in silent concentration, until it goes away. With this strange moment, we have already noticed that there is something highly unusual about these apparently normal people, although the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> That little scene stays with me briskly after all these years, along with many others. The film has an amazing quality that will not let pass, and it is not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make this available for the home video!
