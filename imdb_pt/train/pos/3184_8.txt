This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than the value of the week of "The Young & The Restless". This is another setback to the original trilogy of 'Emmanuelle' (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a sleazefest of D'Amato. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) goes through a dizzying transformation from a stern nurse to a sexy prostitute. The future Italian porn / political star, Illona Staller, who would later be called Ciccolina (and would have sexual relations with a seropositive John Holmes), plays the competition of Emy. Exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes around this. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
