Sarah Silverman is ... better than the other shows. No clue of laughter, no painful joke, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you're like me, and love comedy, this is probably a spectacle for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings out, funny and right here, funny to the table with ease. A mixture of different styles, which makes it his own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a war of comparison, since it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). . This show is their own entity, and I think most comedy bosses will like it very well. <br /> <br /> Go watch and see.
