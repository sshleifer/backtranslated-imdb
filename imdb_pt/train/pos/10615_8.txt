The Invisible is done in a style more like the ancient Hollywood mysteries than with a horror show. The film is a bit slow, but many bizarre images keep the movie alive and watchable. The basic idea of ​​young girls pursued by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the film worth seeing. The film is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated an 8 out of 10.
