This is what I call a movie of growth. Each character is different and better in the end and it is all because a woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedian, really shines as the woman who accomplishes all these changes. Even the men in this movie range from being egocentric to better men. The book was very faithful to the novel, which is an advantage in my book, since I am a librarian. The breathtaking scenery and the message of genuine love.
