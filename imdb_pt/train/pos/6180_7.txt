During the opening night of the Vanties, a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. As the show continues, the police try to gather who killed who and why before the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery, so I was excited to find a copy. Unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers that continue and continue. Although the numbers are certainly the kind Hollywood has done in their glory days, they become intrusive because they virtually stop the film, despite attempts to weave action around them. That would not be so bad if the music was kind of decent, but it's not. There is only good music. Worse still it's as if the studio knew they had a song, Cocktails for Two, and we're forced to endure four versions: a duet, a lot of production, like the Vanities ending and incidental music. I do not think Spike Jones and His City Slickers have played that much. The rest of the film is very good with Victor McLaglen fighting very well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe lover. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that I can recommend this, if you think you can go through the musical numbers, or are willing to scan for them. It's a fun movie the kind they do not do anymore.
