Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a southern family is masterfully described in Writing in the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, an airplane, you choose. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always got him out of trouble. Mitch finished college, Kyle was expelled. Mitch is not from a rich home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls most everything in town. <br /> <br /> While in N.Y., Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, very well played by Lauren Bacall. After a vertiginous romance, he marries her and takes her home. There she meets her father-in-law who tells her how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under the pillow. Bacall's character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a vagabond if at all, played to the utmost by Dorothy Malone, who was voted the best supporting actress. <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. A year of marital bliss for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by the doctor that he can not have children. It is when his wife reveals to him that she is really pregnant, Kyle, thinking that the child is from Mitch, goes on a drunken frenzy and is accidentally shot to death in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, tries, but can not blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable court scene, Malone made all the stops to finally admit that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. His Oscar was well deserved. Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for best supporting actor and lost in a boring victory for Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin in Lust for Life. Douglas Sirk was the master of the 1950s soap operas. Written in the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
