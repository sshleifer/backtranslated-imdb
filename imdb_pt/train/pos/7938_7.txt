Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a bunch of kids who do not look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a night of drunks while vacationing in Las Vegas. Each of them arrives at home and discovers that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to a not so fluffy tabloid. They, Rob and Josie, move the two and their eight children to the house of one or the other. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture, I think, which is close enough to Frank Lambert's (Patrick Duffy) construction job. the very similar step by step to justify the eternal mockery. <br /> <br /> Josie is sort of a cookie queen, though it does not look like she makes any of the cookies. Not close enough to Carol Foster's (Suzanne Somers) hairdressing job to justify mocking similarity, but hilariously absurd enough to justify the mockery of atrocity. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the holidays and really knew one. the surnames of another person, or so one supposes, if they are serious enough about a relationship to make a trip together. <br /> <br /> Either way, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think they should have called Andrew "Andy" younger. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of product placement, particularly for Soup at Hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid and pointless moments. Also not a great movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! That concludes my review of "Footsteps ... about some really bad drugs". Watch out for Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes! There are some great eye shots.
