To my surprise, I really enjoyed 'Spacecamp', I remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently hired it again. I was quite impressed. Of course, the special effects in today's space movies, like Armageddon and Deep Impact, are far superior to those of SpaceCamp. However, this movie had a story - a stereotyped 1980s story, in which you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before you heard it. But that's what I liked - they do not make movies like that, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the lightweight and cute plot. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, it was very cute, but unfortunately had more excitement than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
