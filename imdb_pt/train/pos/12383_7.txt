Christina Raines plays a beautiful model in New York, looking for a new apartment and getting to know strangers and reveal a secret about the building, and slowly builds up to a climax at the end of the movie. This film has all sorts of plot elements from the Roman Catholic Church against the Devil, the gateway to Hell, bizarre rituals, a growing conspiracy, and finally a series of talented actors and actresses flooding the film . We stayed with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Joseph Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Walker, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum and who can forget John Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors hinder him - particularly Burgess Meredith giving a beautiful comic / demented performance as one of the neighbors with a bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable as is Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the artists have practically nothing to do with Jos√© Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even if it is nothing more than a special participation. The Sentinel is a good horror movie with lots of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes. The final scene is repulsive and still creepy. I really criticize some of the free sex and violence in the movie, particularly that whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was that really necessary? I think not. In addition, the father / daughter was a little better, but overall the film works and has a winning rhythm. Director Michael Winner does a hard work and is effective in creating moments of tension and horror film. Scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
