Dead To Rights is about a cop named Jack Slate, who finds his father murdered and goes after the man he thinks killed him. Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspects of having killed his father. Several months later, the day Jack is about to be executed, he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who charged him with murder. Jack's search takes him down a beep track that does not end until everyone is dead. Through the game Jack uses M4 Carbines weapons for his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels. The game is basically "kill 30 people, find the switch to open 50 people , find the switch to open the door "repeatedly until the level is finished. There are fun mini-games as well as playing as a stripper to distract security guards at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club, or disarm bombs. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is also a difficult game. You will be placed in an area full of bad guys armed with submachine guns while you only have one pistol. Near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck. Dead To Rights is as bloody as it is difficult. If you shoot a guy in the face with a bloodshot gun shot will splash on the walls, ceiling and floor. And since there are several guys in each area, the walls will be painted in blood. <br /> <br /> Family fun for everyone.
