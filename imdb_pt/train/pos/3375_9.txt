In this film, the year 2022 looks very much like the seventies. This is fun at first, but soon the viewer realizes how different this decadent futuristic world is in spite of appearances, how many things we take for granted can become unavailable. <br /> <br /> Characters usually interact in a peculiar way. , without tact or good manners or respect. I believe this is intentional, not bad acting. After all, those who witnessed social changes in the 1960s and 1970s can assume that by 2022 the inhabitants of an overpopulated city would behave like this. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the action scenes, besides the priest's death: very cheap until the seventies. The plot is not very polished. But the big scenes and ideas - like the death of the Sun, the way the rioters and bodies are treated, the "furniture" - overcome the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
