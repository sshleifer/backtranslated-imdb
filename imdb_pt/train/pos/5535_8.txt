The first image of the film shows a ridge in the early autumn morning fog, and my thought was, "This is almost too beautiful." And it continues: images of landscapes and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each one perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This may seem old-fashioned and escapist, but it fits into a story that is itself of silent beauty, happening at the border between life and the fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The extreme parsimony of the film, having a simple and slow story, only an actor and almost no special effect, exerted a strong magic. Therefore, I find it deplorable that this parsimony is abandoned in the last minutes, when, suddenly, two additional actors (the girl as an adult woman and her son) are introduced. Another disadvantage is music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring an English pop song along with the glory of the French mountain. I went to the movies together with my two small daughters, but I also recommend the adults, since they enjoy this type of movie. Obviously, not everyone does.
