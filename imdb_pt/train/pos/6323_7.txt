"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialogues of recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of perhaps another movie we've seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to find out what we remembered was the movie. 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, can not be bad. Since this is a set of pieces, all the characters have an opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie introduces us to a group of supposedly safe hell crackers. No one could think that these men could do a job like they do. All that could go wrong, and more, is what they can do. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the secure master cracker who is also seen representing a rabbi, only to be mistaken for a priest by members of the gang leaving Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy The Movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these little crooks do their thing. Let your funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see, this gang is doomed from start to finish!
