The scene in which Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's signaling spirits is reason enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! Have more! This is a good shot of daytime TV, movie stars on the way down (and above) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is splendid. The dialogue is witty and the physical humor done with consummate skill. This is a film that will appeal to those who truly enjoy the art of acting, directing and writing.
