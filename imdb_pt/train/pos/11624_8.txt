Red Eye, a movie that Id wanted to see for some time ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner a management pose for Assassins, and his literally murderous plan to overthrow a very profiled man and his family. /> <br /> An ordinary woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, goes to work, home ... worries ... hates flying. <br /> <br /> The death of his grandmother sends her on a flight that has delayed several times. <br /> <br /> A flight where she meets Jack ... an ordinary fellow, until he reveals his profession and plans, which coincidentally include her in them, she is The key to Keefe's (sp) death. <br /> <br /> She can save them ... but almost the cost of her life is taken, Jack is beaten ... the Keefs are saved ... oh what a story * laughs * just kidding, the movie is actually really good, the best of last year ... there are little things that you have to pay attention to previously in the movie that have a GREAT importance in the movie afterwards. .. (the pen Frankenstein) I w attached it several times before catching all the jokes and quirks ... a must see for non-sexual thriller fans, but there is a slight hint ( "Ohhh ... it's going to be ONE of those flights" (second female attendant) "Hey, this is not a motel" you get the idea ... .
