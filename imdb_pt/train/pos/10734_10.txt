WOW! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best living will, I think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in New York, compared to anything shown by the mainstream media. <br /> <br /> Those outlets can only show what happened outside. This movie shows what happened inside. <br /> <br /> It starts with a focus on a rookie New York firefighter, waiting for weeks for the first big fire he'll be called to fight. The subject turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING PASS OF THE FIRST PLAN TO TOUCH THE TOWERS. You are then given a front row seat as the firefighters rush to the scene in the lobby of Tower One. In the minutes preceding the fall of the second plane, and the subsequent fall of Tower Two, you sees firefighters reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby. It's a sight you will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> Painful, shivering and very attractive from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one. of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
