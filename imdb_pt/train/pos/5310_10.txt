Pecker is another mainstream John Waters movie made in a smaller mother than Serial. The title character of Pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of anything he sees. It does not matter if it is dirty or shocking when it takes photos. He soon uses the photos he took and displays them in his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. Her father works in a bar with a claw machine, but does not make enough money from a lesbian strip bar across the street. His mother runs a store and likes to dress poor people. Her older sister, Tina, works in a gay bar, where her specialty is commerce. Your youngest, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and nothing but sugary food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with her. He also has 2 friends. In his friends, Matt is a store thief and his girlfriend, Shelley, takes care of a laundry rug as if it were a dictator. Soon, a New York tourist buys his photos and displays them in an art gallery. With the image comes fame, but the photos expose the uncommon lifestyle of the simple life of your friends and family. For a film rated R, Pecker is more than most of Waters' previous films and even Pink Flamingos. More 10 of 10!
