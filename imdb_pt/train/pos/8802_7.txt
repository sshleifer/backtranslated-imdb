This is a very interesting project that could have been quite brilliant. Bringing together 11 prominent international directors and assigning each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short exploring the global reverberations of September 11. Without using spoilers, I would say Ken Loach's piece is the jewel in the crown, and Mira Nair's short film (India segment), based on a true story, deserves to be transformed into a full-length movie. One also notices while watching his short, because Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? he is simply a master of the medium, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. Youssef Chahine, in his segment "Egypt," assumes the Arab position of collective self-inflicted guilt, a piece that could have been potentially the most interesting. He fails miserably. Chahine's short film is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among other chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give the movie 7/10 for the concept, if not for the execution.
