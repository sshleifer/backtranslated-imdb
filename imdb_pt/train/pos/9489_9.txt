I'm not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictitious state, but obviously deals with the assassination of Kennedy. A true and honest public prosecutor (played by Yves Montand) does not believe the murder was planned and executed by single man Daslow (= Oswald) and although all other employees want to close the case, he continues to investigate with his team. The script is written firm and fast and holds the tension to the end. Only the part dealing with Milgram's experiment on the authorities is (though not unattractive) a bit out of place. The final sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partially filmed in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
