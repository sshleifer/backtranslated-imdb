I have not read all the reviews but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version can be abbreviated. I'm curious about that because the back parts of the movie did not make much sense to me, even when I got them back. 30 minutes seems too short for a movie in 1917 as well. "Poor Little Rich Girl," which was Tourneur's next film is 65 minutes long and "Pride of the Clan" which was its previous feature was 84 minutes long. So I'm relieved to see that I was not crazy, part of that movie must have been missing and that's why the resolution did not make much sense. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to review or comment on a movie that you're only able to see half of ... but I'd recommend this movie anyway because of the really fascinating insight that gives us the inside of a studio cinema of the east coast of the time. It is the first film that I have seen personally based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who was later a major Hollywood actor and appeared in almost every Preston Sturges film. He plays a Western actor, perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, who Warwick looks a bit like. After the really fascinating sequences in the studio, we see them in a place where he discovers a country girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to go to New Jersey for a screen test that goes very wrong. After that point, the movie seems to be missing important parts in the way we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in the history of cinema for the value of the documentary, but in the way that it does not hold up as a movie and is not a good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur.
