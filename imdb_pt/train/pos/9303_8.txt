When watching this movie, you should realize that it is not a normal movie. There's no real story just characters, a lot of gangster characters that come together in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can simply lie down and listen. The film stands out because it is difficult to find a correct way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why the user comments on this movie are so mixed. <br /> I at least love the movie and recommend it to everyone who loves one-liners and things that differ from the "normal." You can not really put your finger on what's so wonderful about it, it's just a comic world where gangsters dominate. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
