The premise of the story is simple: an old man who lives alone in the forest accidentally comes across the murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder occurred. Although very little dialogue is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told only by the camera's eye has made the film quite engaging. The gray forest scenery conveys a sense of solitude, which complements the tranquility of the characters themselves. We may also feel helpless in the inability of the old man to convince the police of the murder, which resembles the inability of the silenced child to tell his own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in the feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. . This film successfully addresses these elements only by visuals, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak. <br /> <br /> Cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to increase tension for some frightening and startling moments. The ending is also unexpected and believable. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water," or English horror films such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents," this film offers viewers the experience of the true horror of the atmosphere. I recommend anyone who likes a good shiver to try to scare the movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the movies I just mentioned, you may want to give them a try too.
