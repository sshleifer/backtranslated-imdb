I've seen this movie at Comedy Central a few times. This movie was really good. It is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is willing to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the US can obtain an army base to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate." I also loved the final theme. That gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
