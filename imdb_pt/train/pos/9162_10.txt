Although I have not started reading "Classics" in literature until I'm 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there is not a part of the book that I enjoy less, only parts that I liked more. The 1983 TV mini-series, with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton, was all I expected it to be. I saw him as a complete movie in 2006. Mr. de Dalton Rochester 'was very good, but I absolutely loved Zelah's' Jane Eyre'. Regarding another 'Classics' movie I saw recently, I was disappointed with the production, direction and dialogue. It was only true to the avarice and arrogance of Hollywood. Artistic license for great works in literature is nothing less than plagiarism. Using the title after such a license is fraud. Leave it to the British to get this right (among others). You will not be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with its proper context and spirit. Well done BBC.
