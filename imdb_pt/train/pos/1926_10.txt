In 1967, I visited the glider of Lake Elsinore and flew a yellow Pratt Read glider. Coming back to Germany, the above basses ran on TV and a segment went on high-altitude glider flights in California in the early 1950s. (The real-life pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played him in the series) We found that the glider in the movie was the same (the same N number) that I had flown on Lake Elsinore. Since I've seen this thread I've been looking for it and I've been wondering if it's somewhere available. (other segments of this series were about Baker's Ejection Seat, an instrument for finding avalanche victims etc.
