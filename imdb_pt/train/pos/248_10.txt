'Ned Kelly' is a wonderful Australian film that honors a true Australian hero. We are taken to the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and the other members of Kelly Gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional cast, which all give stellar performances, which gives life to the film. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing the role of calm, loyal ladiesman very well. I was raptured at the time. For a moment I almost believed that the gang would win the battle at Glenrowan, unfortunately, it was not to be. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid fan of Ned Kelly (and supporter), he was a bit disappointed in that. Maybe also the film could have been longer, to cover more of the life of Kelly Gang / Ned - I did not feel enough was covered. <br /> <br /> Regardless of some flaws, this is a moving movie that stirs all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I'd say this movie would be better to watch than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned ...)
