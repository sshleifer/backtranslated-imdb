Zombie 3 has an interesting story in its production. First, it's a continuation of Fulci's hit, Zombie 2, with Zombie 2 itself being, of course, a marketing ploy to fool people into thinking that it was a sequel to Dawn of the Dead, also known as Zombie, from George A. Romero. Confused enough? Basically, none of the movies have anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I think Fulci himself started not caring about producing halfway through Zombie 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help fill the film with additional scenes to extend the runtime. <br /> <br /> The plot of Zombie 3 is your typical zombie experience. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal a plague and zombies go haywire. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is determined to topple everyone without prejudice. There are also brief inserts from a radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I've heard horrible things, but I find the silly dialogue quite pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, corrupt military, man playing with God, etc. I got the impression that this was at one point a serious movie, but it deviated in a strange direction, presumably when Mattei boarded. <br /> <br /> In addition to stealing other zombie movies, this was very reminiscent of The Crazies by Romero. You hear the Radio DJ giving the good news with: "When you see the men in white suit and gas masks, run to them for help." This is of course played for the pictures of the men in white shooting at zombies. Later, they end up stealing a Crazies scene in which one of the normal, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is very good in this case, with hordes of zombies in every corner. How cool is that? Let me count the ways 1. Birth of zombies 2. Flying zombie head 3. Zombie birds. 4. Legless zombie swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the maniac wielding machetes at the gas station. He was an idiot and nearly knocked over the whole building trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite phrase ?? When a sergeant insists on creaming a zombie, the scientists ask, "Do not you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" To which the sergeant responds boldly, "Now you're talking about science fiction." He also continues to mention the "Science Fiction" told by scientists until the end, when everyone dies. Extras: Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, most notably the one with Mattei, where he insists he drove. 40% of the scenes, it is still not possible to remember any or any other significant details. <br /> <br /> In short: A must see for fans of zombies and Fulci. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
