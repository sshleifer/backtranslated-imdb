A strange role for Eddie Murphy to take on at the height of his career. Although there is a lot of "character Eddie Murphy", he plays a truly decent person. The rest of the cast is good, particularly the lovely Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of his character kept the tone of the film from being very Murphy.
