The French brothers Naudet did something no one else did, they had a video camera the day this tragedy happened. They were in Building 2, when you could see the papers falling, people hitting the floor jumping from such a height. <br /> <br /> I mean it goes so far as when both buildings collapsed they ran, the camera was still running, when the white dust covered them, they found a shop door and they went in, but all this filming is real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us. <br /> <br /> Stars goes to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary movie that I watch every 9/11 so I will never forget what this country has gone through. I believe that, as I recall, it shows the firefighter's first death while he was being taken to the church and his honorable funeral.
