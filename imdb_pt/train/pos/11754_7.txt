Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathetic, but comes out a bit strident. Donald Moffat is also a note as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is excellent as the quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, taking the film for most of its tough spots. It fits in well with time, but it is little more than that.
