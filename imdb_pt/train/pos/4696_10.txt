Although this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I see it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> One of the movie quotes stands out. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) arrives at his office and parks in a disabled location, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "I can not park here, it's for the handicapped ". <br /> <br /> Danny responds, "I'm deficient, I'm psychotic." <br /> <br /> That's one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch, I'll make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously is in my top 5 comedy / spoof movies of all time. <br /> <br /> As an added bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle not cast. So watch this movie and like me and many others who have watched, you will get hooked.
