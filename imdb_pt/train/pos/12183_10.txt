One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in cinema. More than a triple threat that could act, write and direct, he had a genius exclusively fit for cinema. It may be considered if at an earlier age he would have been a painter. This film certainly reinforces this impression. A musician, a stage actor, an heir to Shakespeare? It's hard to say but I'm very thankful for his time camera with the movie and he have it captured in the movie. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all of your movies and I wish there were more. I particularly love how other actors interacted with him in the movie. Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was firmly there. Even in the end, when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intention, he was impossible to ignore and he did all the scenes in which he was. Rita was a beautiful blonde - a Lana Turner look-alike, but perhaps even prettier and yet eye goes to Welles and one wishes for another minute, another movie, another hour in her company. That's why we all want to find the missing pieces of your movies because we know, we all know, that there is no part of it that is not worthy of our time. Watch and be thankful for the chance.
