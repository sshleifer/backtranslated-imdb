This is a beautiful tale of guilt-driven obsession. <br /> Matiss on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) Passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes without a word. Just the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then just too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film chronicles his efforts to find out more about the woman. In a troll of local bars, he finds his pocket. He divides her life more and more. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He has to do the right things. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with the "bastard ex-boyfriend," he forces Alexej to face the guilt they both feel. <br /> <br /> Haunting long takes, a soundtrack to accent guilt, barking at dogs. Footsteps Lovely movie noir with a lovely touch. A good Indie ending.
