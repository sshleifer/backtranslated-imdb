Great actors, an Oscar-nominated actress, a gorgeous setting, a good strong storyline and more laughter than you can put in my new bag (and that's pretty big). This movie was brilliant. It was beautifully portrayed in the most serious scenes and the funny moments were. well, lateral division. I've never heard a movie audience laugh so hard, and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the scene of 'ladies at the tea shop'. Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients ensured that this is one of my favorite movies of the year, if not all of the time.
