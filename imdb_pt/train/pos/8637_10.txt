"Kalifornia" is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The film has a cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, The River Runs Through It, and The Legends of the Fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The New Generation , And Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and What's Eating Gilbert Grape as Adele Corners, Early's girlfriend.) Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal, is preparing to write a book about serial killers.Brian and his girlfriend Carrie decide they want to move to California So Brian places an ad in college for some who want to go to California to share travel expenses. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is a former con and sociopath on parole, who recently lost his job at the mirrors factory in the city, is owed, owes the owner money. probation of Stop stops to visit him and tells him about a job. Lege and sees the ad, later he tells Adele, his girlfriend about how to go to California. Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town. Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a murderer who just killed his son. For a while Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele differently but managed to meet them and become friends, Carrie and Adele became true friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey is very interesting. Although Brain and Carrie do not know early is a killer later in the movie. The question Brian asks in this movie about the difference between killers and us is a very good question. Early Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the error of his ways, descends the hill later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up. I love the songs of the movie, especially in the end of the movie, the song "Look Up To The Sky ", by The Indians.
