This movie starts hilarious about the 15-second mark and continues throughout the film. I can not remember a scene where I did not look at people laughing at me. he's the perfect actor for that role because of the way he looks and the way he dresses. <br /> <br /> The comic pieces were great to see from not very big or popular actors. As you can see people like this movie, it is currently rated at 7.9 in IMDb. I think it should be at 250. Let's put it this way I have not seen this funny movie since the American Pie or the original vacation. see if you want to laugh. I give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs I've ever given since I found out about IMDb, great movie site.
