Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick on the move, it had to be you? Was he talking to Charlie and Annna in the church when they were leaving? If not, I'll have to rent the movie. This movie was great. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I knew my only true love (my soul mate) and although I had the experience of knowing him when I least expected it, I was not ready for this kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Besides, we got married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I was complacent and took his love for granted and he held out for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He finally came away with resentment, but we're still hurt and angry and not believing the way it happened. I have had some very difficult lessons to learn and now we have been separated for 3 years. <br /> <br /> This movie meant a lot because I'm still waiting to be reconciled with my one true love. I can now appreciate that distinct feeling within me, and the quote from Father Fitzpatrick seemed true to me. <br /> <br /> I know that when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will be remarried. <br /> <Never trust and take the true love of the concession! IT WAS THE LAST LESSON OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> Also the music in this movie is EXCELLENT and SIGNIFICANT! This film is deep and spiritually uplifting. True love is worth waiting, if it is to be, will, no matter what, will happen! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time around! Thank you!
