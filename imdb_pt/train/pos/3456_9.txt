There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows that. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the detective story writing team, does not know that. He kills his partner, Jim Ferris, who had plans to go it alone. Columbo steps in and asks Mr. Franklin all kinds of questions. And return to one more question. Columbus: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by young Steven Spielberg before his days of fame. Steven Bochco wrote. Columbo is a fantastic character with his poor look. It is hard to believe that this man could solve any crime. But he could. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who could portray this character. So there are no remakes, please.This part is a good example of how Columbus worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim.Rosemary Forsyth plays the wife of the victim, Joanna Ferris. There's something nice about the scenes between Columbus and her. As he makes the omelet and everything else. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. She actually knew a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here. I have been a fan of Columbus since childhood and still enjoy watching them. There was a break for many years when they were not showing the stories of Columbus, but now he's back. Back to one more question.
