This was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip of him on YouTube, and I promised that if it were shown on TV, I would stick to the set to watch. I ended up watching with a friend of mine, who happened to be gay, and we both cried in the end. This was a truly well written, heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two policemen who, I felt, really were (in the words of Coop) "the Lucky Ones." are episodes like this that really make Cold Case one of the most captivating and beloved works of television magic on CBS. I look forward to more episodes and a repeat of "Forever Blue", because I always watch again and again.
