Twelve Monkeys is an action-packed, insane movie starring Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back in time to gather information on the devastating plague that began in November 1996. Unfortunately, he too was sent back. until the year 1990, where everyone believes he is insane. <br /> <br /> This movie is thrilling and has great performances from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys is one of the greatest travel movies that I believe anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
