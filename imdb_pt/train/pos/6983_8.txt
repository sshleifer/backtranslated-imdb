I loved it, having been a fan of the original series, I always wondered what would be the story behind it - I was delighted. I also love the fact that aside from Eric Stoltz, I did not recognize a person - this is refreshing, much like BSG. He introduced me to a wealth of new talent - I can not wait for the series to begin showing. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and staff - great job. Special effects, dialogue, and acting were all too visible, and I felt emotionally tied into the plot. I know there are purists out there who will probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the science fiction stuff produced in the last decade.
