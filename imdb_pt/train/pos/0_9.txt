Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs on school life, such as "Teachers." My 35 years in the teaching profession have led me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than "Teachers." The struggle to survive financially, the insightful students who can see through the pathetic pathetic of the teachers, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and of their students. When we saw the episode in which student repeatedly tried to burn school, A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to fire one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I hope many adults my age think that Bromwell High is very improbable. Too bad it is not!
