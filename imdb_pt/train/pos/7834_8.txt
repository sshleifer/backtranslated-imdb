Please also see my commentary on Die Nibelungen part 1: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The second part of the gigantic production of the Nibelungen saga of UFA studio continues in the stylized, symphonic and emotionally distanced form of its predecessor. However, while the first part was a non-passionate portrait of individual acts of heroism, the second part is a chaotic description of large-scale sangria. <br /> <br /> As in the first part, director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of action and complexity of the composition of the scene rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands. These images should only be watched with the perfect note from Gottfried Huppertz, who fortunately is on the Kino DVD. Now, with that focus on mass action, Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging. The action sequences in their early traits were often poorly constructed, but now it simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow, with the level of onscreen activity swelling like an orchestra. <br /> <br /> But as part one made us witness the adventures of Siegfried naturally and without excitement, the second part presents the war as a devastating tragedy. In both images, there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. That's why Lang keeps the camera out of action, never allowing us to feel like we're there (and that's significant because engaging the audience is usually a distinction from Lang's work). That is also why the performances are artificially theatrical, with the actors oscillating like constipated sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> However, Kriemhild's revenge constantly deals with emotions and is, in fact, deeply humanistic. The unique moment of naturalism is when Atilla holds his young son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasizes the tenderness of this scene by riding it with the wild, frenzied ride of the Huns. The point is that Lang never manipulates us to take sides, and in that respect, this version has more in common with the original saga than with Wagner's opera. The climactic slaughter is the antithesis of a stimulating battle scene. Why then did Hitler and co. to get your eyes wet because of it, a fact that unfairly harmed the reputation of these films? Because the Nazis' unshakable racial ideology made them automatically see the Nibelungs as the good guys, even though they kill babies and betray their own kinsmen. For Hitler, his fall would always be a nationalistic tragedy, not a human one. <br /> <br /> But for us non-Nazi spectators, what makes this image so pleasing is the beautiful sense of pomp and musical rhythm. When you see these silent and fully developed images of Lang, you realize how much was wasted in Hollywood. Rather than burdening him with low-budget potbillers, they should have put him to work on some of these sword and sandal epics, photos that do not have to be believable and need not excite us, where poetics are. , operatic tone that sweeps us together.
