In all my 60 years of age, I learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification (whether we like it or not) implied with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because the character performs certain gesture, sometimes because the character speaks determined word or sentence? do we use or would like to use ?? in a given situation. <br /> <br /> The film in question should be seen from this point of view. Who now finds a parking space? in a mall, downtown or on the street - driven by a car whose driver can not remember thinking that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who does not have the desire to "rubber out" the rude spit? Haven said I ask, "Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)?" If your answer is: YES !, then try not to find absurd details ?? compared to the reality of life? in the movie because you will surely find the film ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Abstractions made, you will see that the film has moments of surprise, such as: 1- In the sequence in which Della picks up the toolbox in the trunk (that box contains a weapon, and she has the courage to use it?); 2 - In the sequence in which Terry dies while falling; 3 - In the sequence in which Della is attracted by the "call of the mermaid" of Chuckie. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the movie, or are planning to see it, keep in mind that there are "realist" movies, "fiction" movies, "political" movies and movies where you can " soul"? To exemplify the latter, we can cite: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the paper, there was unanimous applause when BOPE officials took certain actions. (As I saw the movie on DVD, I could not verify the reaction of the audience) ?? <br /> <br /> As for the direction part (Susan Monford), interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc. Edition (William M. Anderson, 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card', edition exceptional, Robocop 2, etc. It is well situated in context. On a scale of 1 (Awful) to 10 (Master Piece), I rate "When She Was Out" at 7 (Regular).
