This movie is so much fun. I've seen it a few times, but there's always something funny that I remember. The car scene "ducklings and bunnies" is one of my favorites, and I still quote versions of certain Morone words! <br /> <br /> There are so many jokes running around that it's incredible. But I love Michael Keaton anyway!
