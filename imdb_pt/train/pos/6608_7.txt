There are about 25 years of inspiration. Beginning with existential themes from Blade Runner, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products, technology from the later Matrix films and Spielberg's AI, and finally the black and white graphic novel resembling Sin City's style. The creators have made a great effort in the visual department and the result is a future neo-noir. Add a detective story and you will have an interesting movie. I know what I wanted to be, but regardless of the dazzling look, it was not enough to reach the final destination.
