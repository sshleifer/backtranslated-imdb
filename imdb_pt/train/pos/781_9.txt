"Crush" examines female friendship, mostly by avoiding the saccharine quality that spoils so many films with the same theme (eg "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to dominate and surprise. The events described were highly improbable, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me. It's not a movie for the high-speed, explosive vehicle crowd, but adult women will certainly respond with both laughter and tears.
