I'm surprised by the low IMDb rating of this movie. With all due respect, her low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated her so poor. They prefer to watch a movie with cheap emotions, a bigger budget and more blood. <br /> <br /> The first misconception of people is that it is a horror movie. It's not, nor does the movie fool you into believing it to be one. It's a psychological thriller. It's for people who really want an intellectual experience when they watch a movie. Reel.com's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost like trying to make an original movie for a change - very rare nowadays - is a bad thing and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'm going to reveal some spoilers to the idiots who said it was boring and does not make sense. Martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a careful mother while she was actually an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first glance we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster while the film lasts is a testament to the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel like this movie should be rated at least in the 6 's in originality alone. I recommend this movie to people on the other side of the IQ scale - also known as smart people - since this movie is obviously being massacred by those who prefer to watch Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos to acting too. For such a low-budget movie, you're surprised that this movie did not hit your local cinema with great direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by the IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. I really recommend buying the movie since a first preview of a rental will not do it justice.
