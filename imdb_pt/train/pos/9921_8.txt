I have been admiring the work of Edward Burtynsky for years, and it was a great pleasure to be able to see the man at work thanks to the documentary by Jennifer Baichwal. The harsh beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the quarry in Vermont, the huge assembly plant in China, the old beleaguered neighborhoods in Shanghai that are just waiting to be overturned: these landscapes are so well captured by the photographer and the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought of old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories; the kind of thing I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how industrial activity only changed to Asia, it did not stop. The strangest scene for me was the computer junk yard somewhere in China - the garbage looked menacing, while the workers were very jovial.
