"Rich in Love" is a slice of life movie that takes the viewer to the happenings of a somewhat quirky family from Charleston, SC. Highly romanticized, beautifully filmed, well written and rendered, "RIL" takes over as a summer breeze, while its imprecise plot gives life to the characters, so that at the end of the movie you will feel like an old friend of the family. <BR> <BR> A wonderfully elaborate character-driven film by the director of "Driving Miss Daisy," "RIL" is a somewhat obscure sleeper that will appeal to most mature audiences.
