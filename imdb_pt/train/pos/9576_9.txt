One of the most nihilistic and brutal movies I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and exciting. This is an action melodrama like the world has never seen before. At times, the plot would leave me close to tears, while in the next moment, shocking revelations, like a blow of bones in the bowels. Cooling performance by Edison Chen. The story of an HK-Cop and a Cambodian assassin chasing each other, though losing his humanity slowly, is strong. With very little dialogue in favor of haunted images and heavy camera work, "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK-Bloodshed without the heroism.
