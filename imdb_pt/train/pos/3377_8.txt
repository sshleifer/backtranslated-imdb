Soylent Green is a classic. I've been waiting for someone to redo this. They seem to be remaking science fiction classics nowadays (ie, War of the Worlds) and I'm hoping that some director / producer will re-do Soylent Green. With the animation and computer technology of today, it would have the potential to be a great image. Anti-utopian films may not be so absurd. The human race reproduces itself as cockroaches without external influence to reduce it. We, as human beings, have the option of placing the kibosh in the procreation of smaller species if they get out of control, but there is nothing to control human creation except ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish. Malthusian classical economics states that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing .... this is obscene.
