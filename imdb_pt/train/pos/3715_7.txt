Okay, this was a pretty small number, but I can not help but think I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA movie I saw in Poitier called "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE" It also had spots from "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in their execution. Which is not to say that they are not good references ... just that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel closer to advertising (like an approach in style and history) than the work of an original and authentic author to come. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just ... too perfect for my taste. Too much coral filter (or charcoal) for my taste ... very arched framed 12mm. So the whole impression left me a little distant - beware of the art that is proclaimed readily! The French (they are a conservative gang) seemed to buy it as did the jury though ... but the short film selection of Cannes is notoriously conservative compared to this is feature selection although I wonder what has happened in recent years.
