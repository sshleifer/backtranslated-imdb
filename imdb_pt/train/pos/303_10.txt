Since the day I saw this movie, when it was released in 1981, it was one of my 3 favorites. The synopsis I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm very happy that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this film explains his appeal - "Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed." A charming and witty romantic comedy is a love story written for New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is native) who can identify all the sites (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the former FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire cast also clicked off the screen, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than the CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also the last appearance of Audrey Hepburn (she had a special guest following this film) and her inner beauty drains from the screen. Shop, make a great tub of popcorn and snuggle with someone you love.
