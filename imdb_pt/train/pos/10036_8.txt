Both showed real talent when this came out and both continued to show just that in their latest movies as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally as impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, action, suspense and special effects are magnificent made especially for the time. The horror of the situation in which the characters were felt so real because it actually happened, making you want most of them to survive this life-and-death situation. The pace was a bit slow at times and was a bit long, but the rest of the movie made up for its flaws.
