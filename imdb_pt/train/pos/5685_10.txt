Congratulations to the director and cast for such a realistic film. The harshness, lack of glamor and despair attracted me to the film and kept me there. I was really impressed with how the dates and information were conveyed in the film; that is, newspapers, letters, etc. I kept the movie moving so fast I did not feel like pushing it once. Personally, I thought all the basics did a tremendous job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performances of this nature usually startled me. Overall, this is a brilliant movie not to be missed!
