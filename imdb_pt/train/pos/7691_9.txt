This show was a milestone in the American comedy, as it was the first sitcom to star an entire African-American cast. Unfortunately, it was never broadcast on British TV. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living on a tower block. The father is called James, he tries to run the house, but his Florida wife always gets the better of him. The three children are the artistic JJ, the temperamental Thelma and the young intellectual Michael. Always coming into the house is the gossipy friend from Florida, Willona. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - the only two on the site). You may be wondering why an English viewer has watched a series that has never been or almost never been heard in your country. The answer is this. In 1976, Britains first all black series came out called "The Fosters". Only two sets have been made and now it seems forgotten. But I watched an episode and was really impressed. So I learned that the scripts were identical to the "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster and the three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's gossiping friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote a comment on this). While watching "Good Times" only two things bothered me. First was the song's opening theme (horrible) and secondly the laughter of the audience. I like to laugh at the audience, but this one would say a funny line and the audience would go crazy and start clapping. Plus, it was a really fun show. Let's hope that more episodes appear on youtube and hopefully someone will release "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Sex and the Evans Family - Episode 1 Series 6. The episode of Foster was called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw, Black Jesus was a title of an episode of "The Fosters"
