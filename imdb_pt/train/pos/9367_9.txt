It is not very common for a movie to literally make the whole audience laugh and five minutes later to fill their eyes with tears. Many movies try to do this, but few can cause the emotional impact that this movie caused. Adam Sandler virtually drags you with his heated and often violent outbursts, but it also makes you laugh when the shadow of your past is not knocking you down. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there's one particular scene that should have her eyes watering and her lips trembling. Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but is surpassed by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances but nothing in the line of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which really saved the film from being depressing. There are several laughs, but do not think that you will stay there for long, because you become serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on and talk about how this movie was successful about every emotion the human body contains, but I'll cut this short one. I feel there is no need to tell you anything else. Do yourself a favor and enjoy watching this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it's worth 100% worth. A deeply moving film, sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you are a heartless soul.
