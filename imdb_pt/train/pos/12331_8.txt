Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead at number three in their five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time loving this parody of the student film, I feel that I must defend this movie against the harsh criticism posted earlier. This short but sweet work has always been a pleasure for marathons of horror and science fiction films where those who participate love the genre but know that they do not take zombie movies very seriously. This film is an homage to the original, not an insult. It is meant to be funny, and many others who have heard singing and applauding agree with me that it is successful. Especially for those of us who have seen the NOTLD 50+ times. Pay attention to the cameo director as reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the opportunity to get his parody Alien, Loaf.
