I wanted "that 70's show" to come back on television. It was the biggest show of all time !!! They should make episodes between the other episodes, but of course this would be confusing. But I'd like you to come back and do more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely hilarious. You could not laugh without seeing an episode. There's a very funny part in each episode and the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie were dating together. Those were the best episodes. "This 70's show is the best" .... It will be and always will be the best show of all time. It was very sad when the show ended. They must make new episodes.
