In my opinion, this is a great celebrity skit show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons why I said this. Although Hal Sparks is a good host, sometimes I wish Greg Kinnear did not leave. If you ask me, it seems that no one stays with a TV show throughout its execution. Still, I enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people faking celebrities. If you ask me, that was very funny. Before I finish, I must say that I miss this show. Now in conclusion, I highly recommend this show for all fans of hard-die-hard sketch show. You really will like it.
