This movie is a riot. I do not remember the last time I had so much fun in the movies. I've seen some good comedies in my time and they're usually pretty funny. But this is wall to wall large lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so much and so much. The movie went on and on until the end when they did the 5-minute sentimental cleansing. In addition, it is a constant barrage of a lining and goofy situations. I'd like to see you again before you leave the theater because it's like Zucker's movies where you do not get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see this two or three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> As for the actual movie, it could have used a better edition, it is unstable sometimes, but we have to forgive that. All the characters are great. It's not like a movie by Adam Sandler where he tries to be funny and everyone suffers around him and is the target of the joke. I think I'll remember all the main characters for many years because they're all so nice. No victims in this movie. Also, thank goodness they got a 45-year-old actress to play their girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she's a sweetheart in this movie. You just want women like her to really exist. She's not a "10" like some of the other top ladies, but somehow her smile is hotter than Julia Roberts's overbite overbone. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie you can not think too much about it. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give all good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I hope critics put it on the top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies do not deserve the recognition they deserve and, at the end of the year, do not put them on the list. That means you Ebert !!!
