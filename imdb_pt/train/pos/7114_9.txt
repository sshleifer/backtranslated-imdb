Definitely, in the top five of John Garfield's best movies has to be Pride of the Marines. It is the true story of Al Schmid, a soldier of the Navy, who at the cost of his own vision, while wounded detained a horde of Japanese in Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is well segmented into three parts, the life at home of Al Schmid where he is a simple worker who is getting serious with a woman and who does not like anything better than his night of bowling. Pearl Harbor is bombed and it goes to war as millions of others have been. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he is in an isolated machine gun nest, holding the Japanese troops. His action prevented Marines positions from being invaded, but a grenade does so in his vision. <br /> <br /> And of course the third part is your painful adaptation to civilian life and to make sure that people are not just taking care of them. he out of pity, above all that girl he was seeing Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was broadcast on TCM about John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield presented by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the most credible actor in the working-class roles of having and possessing a union membership card. <br /> <br /> In that respect, he was fortunate to have landed with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to be typecast in gangster roles in that studio's tradition, Garfield was fantastic in these areas because of his training because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had, except Garfield's Jewish past. In this regard, he was perfect to play the role of a working-class hero like Al Schmid, who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. There are no super heroes here, just a guy who preferred to be back in Philadelphia, but doing a job that had to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a great part for Garfield. It's a movie not to be missed. I wonder what happened to the real Al Schmid.
