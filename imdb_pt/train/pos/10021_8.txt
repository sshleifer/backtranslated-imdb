This tale based on two pieces by Edgar Allen Poe ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "Dance of Death" (poem)) is actually quite scary from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black and white films about people in an old decrepit house (eg, "The Cat and the Canary," "The Dark House," "Night of Terror," and so on) . ). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrify the guests. He dies at the beginning of the movie (or him?) And the villagers are subjected to a series of terrible experiences. I will not go into too many details here but it is definitely a must see for fans of ancient mysteries of the houses of darkness. <br /> <br /> Watch with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <Br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
