"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on cable. Having not seen this for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on the Broadway success of James Van Druten, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 1950s, the film was adapted to screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy. <br /> <br /> Of course, judging by some of the comments made by IMDb, the big problem seems to be the pairing of the two stars, who collaborated on "Vertigo", released the same year. The movie's audience did not find anything about the age difference when this movie was released. In fact, most of the male stars of the period were always involved with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie that takes place in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that delights the viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty, for of course the camera adored her, no matter what she was playing. Like the witch who becomes human, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays the editor Shep 'Henderson, is also seen at its best. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows here why he was at the top. In supporting roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, playing Queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as it proves here. . Nicky Holroyd, from Jack Lemmon, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
