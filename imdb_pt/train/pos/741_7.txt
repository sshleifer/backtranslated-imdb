I was a little young for this, but had to see. There is great music, which many people have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance of "Angel", a musical garment now largely ignored but rather popular. Wearing their signature white clothes, they grind through the "20th Century Foxes," and apparently everyone tries to stick to the camera's field of vision. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria continues to be the highlight of the band, and apparently never managed to cut his hair, ever! Cherie Currie (former Runaways singer) begins a brief but remarkable career as an actress here, and is quite memorable alongside Jodie Foster and the rest. (His topless 3D scenes in "Parasite," and his UFO sighting in "Wavelength," kept us all watching for a while.) <br /> <br /> It is not a work of art, but it preserves a piece of your period so that all can contemplate and admire.
