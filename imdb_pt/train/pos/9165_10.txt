This has to be the best adaptation I've seen, it's my favorite and I think it gets very close to the book. What really does this must be seen, although it is the cast of the two main actors. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I I have seen on the screen thoughtful and tragic while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, timidity and kindness like Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is this, young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s who advertises her services as a housekeeper in the newspapers. housekeeper in the grand mansion Thornfield Hall to guide Adele the young ward of mysterious and respected runners Mr. Rochester. As the months go by, he falls in love with Jane and puts into practice some situations to try to see if Jane is madly in love with him as he is with her. However, there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall. and when the effects are devastating. This is a moving and well-acted drama with delightful venues and gorgeous clothes, as I said previously great acting especially from Zelah and Timothy.
