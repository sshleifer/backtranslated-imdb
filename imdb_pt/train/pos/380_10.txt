Giving time to his escapist escape in the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Celie , it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in such films as "Sister Act". This is the kind of film that could easily be - no, do it MUST - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There is a scene that may be the most magnificent editing job you've ever been on the screen (you'll know when to come). I can not believe this did not win a single Oscar; may be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (perhaps even tied with him). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolfo Cesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
