This movie is incredible for three main reasons. It's aesthetically beautiful. I just loved it. There is a daring color theme throughout the film, with extraordinary costumes and picturesque settings. A photograph that looks very expensive (and probably was not) completes the look. I always like these stories about groups of misfits / loners getting together and becoming a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s, but this one does not. This group of actors really portrays characters well flawed but extremely friendly. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the theme of the road movie, I could not help but remember my favorite movie from last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and I was a little annoyed at the performance of Til Schweiger at times. The opening scene, all the scenes in which they spoil their tricks are very funny. There is a mix of humor and excitement throughout the film. I really like the ending. And, of course, it's all about the Magician theme. A good magician is making the audience look where he wants to create an illusion. What happens is exactly what a film director does and that's why they call it the magic movie.
