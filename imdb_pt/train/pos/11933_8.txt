I think this is a lovely family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and thrilling moments throughout the film. The actors are great and the effects performed well everywhere. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also amazing are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top-quality movie from Disney. A touching and moving film that everyone should enjoy.
