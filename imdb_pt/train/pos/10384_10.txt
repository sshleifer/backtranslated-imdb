Almost 30 years later I remember this original PBS movie as almost unbearably tender. Periodically, I check here on IMDb hoping someone has had the good sense to buy the rights and put them on a DVD. It's September 2004, and I keep waiting - a deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two protagonists went through a small career mainly in a night soap in prime time; the other, Frances Lee McCain, has been seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But none of what they did before or after someday equaled this little film that was produced, as I recall, in a short PBS series that featured original screenplays of new and rising playwrights. <br /> <br /> I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of VCRs, so I have no record of it except in my mind. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 Beyond Above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that DVDs are recorded from the writer's personal copy.
