This movie deserved better. It's a lot of fun, it has some wonderful jokes and vision jokes, some stuff for the "Geeks" between us (and we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of an Oscar winner is worth the price of admission alone. I've never read the comic book series before seeing the movie, but since then. as best as it is, I still recommend MM the movie. (Although having the Blazing Carrot as a character has been cool as well) Greg Kinnear is, well, ... amazing as the Incredible Captain, and NOBODY could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy. My favorite phrase in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny. And it looks like she ordered the lobster." Watch this movie. BUY this movie! It's only $ 5 and some change in your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. You really will. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is on it. WHY ALONE makes it worthy of a watch
