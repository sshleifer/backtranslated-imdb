This film is a delightful and lightweight visual on both sides, where the "club kid" scene blends with the worlds of art, music and performance from New York (with a special participation of the ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is the "Trilogy of the Torch Song" for cheerful and post-teen girls. "That Girl" for our times of millennium affected and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is fast and fun, and Parker Posey's client deserves not a gym award, at least - a "wave" of compliments at the stadium. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on the very elegant heels of the Miss Posey platform, and it is perfectly launched. Like much of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it's often self-referential and, well, posey ... but everything works. She is a talented comedian, an incredible artist, and this movie entertains, she carries on her shoulders like a fake leopard wrap, and never lets fall to the ground. <br /> <br /> Mary is a shallow party fashionista who is not above stealing designer clothes from a friend's closet or staying with someone else's boyfriend. On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who care in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that care is necessary for life. <br /> <br /> The script is very well worked, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt, in a very one-dimensional and heavy role; a more nuanced performance of it, would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is comedy. A surprisingly deep role, which gives this film some substance and worldview, is the fallafel boyfriend. We should all be so lucky ... is he the only one for Mary? or the one who runs away? <br /> <br /> I classify this as an 8 because it's not a big time in movie history, it's not a classic, and it's not a great art (it gets deeper and richer in re-viewing)) . Like "Desperately Seeking Susan," this represents something very true about your time period, but it may become irrelevant over time. Still, it has everything an entertainment movie needs, and it's worth seeing several times just for the clothes!
