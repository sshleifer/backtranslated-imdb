This movie I loved since I was young! It is excellent. Although, it may be a little too much for the average movie watcher if it is not possible to interpret certain subtleties of the film (for example, our hero's name is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander he is shot in the heel with a rocket , just as Achilles in mythology was shot in his heel). That's just a small fact that's fun! Anyway, great movie, good story, it would be nice to see it redone with the special effects of today! Interestingly, Gary Graham had medium success, starring in the TV show Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
