This is short and to the point. The story used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. The acting is all over the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It's hard to believe that this series has lasted almost seven years and will come to an end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat what has already been said about the scenarios and graphics. Since this is entirely voluntary, without any profit, it is quite surprising. <br /> <br /> If this were being classified as a professional production, I would have to give 5 for a good story, but terrible sets. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give an excellent rating, with the exception of a few other efforts, this is in a league of its own. By sheer volume, I do not think it has been combined. Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.
