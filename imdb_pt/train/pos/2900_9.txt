If this is an American movie, I'd rate it 7: we've seen it before. Being this an Argentine film, and being myself Argentine, I would like to give a 10, since it is the kind of quality I expected, rather than wait. Its excellent quality is surprising, given all the limitations imposed by the Third World ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene in which Diaz forces Silverstein's fiance to confess - you know what I mean if Did you see the movie? I think this is the key moment of the movie, not surprising, perhaps, still original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie, I always try to gather some previous information. Being this a mainstream, satirical, commercial, I press "Play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, I would say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, but it is credible in a certain way. As for me, I could not stop laughing at all the jokes and comments - "sos malo" ("you're bad") ... put in the mouth of Diaz, the greatest of them. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of watching movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he's an excellent actor, but sometimes I feel his roles unfairly opaque to the rest, the role of Lu√≠s Luque in this case. I do not really like Argentine television, so I have not seen much of Luque's work, but it's pretty obvious he's an excellent interpreter. His physical role, his looks, his content attitude in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should need improvement, just so he can show us how great he can be! <br /> <br /> I do not know if Szifron is planning to do a sequel or not. I know he will not make it if it's to follow the rule that "second parties were never good," so if he can, I'll certainly see. And I hope that, in the future, I'll take into account the possibility of giving Peretti's counterparts the same chance of developing their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performances and lots of laughs!
