I just make an apology for this movie: there are many wide-angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond the limit, it's fair. They drove me in the first ten minutes. But after that I made a sort of truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the movie, I stopped caring. This is a very rich comedy to be destroyed so easily. It's hilarious, witty, the comedy rendition of EVERY cast is flawless, and as much as Usher lurks his characters through cold lenses, fisheye - he may not care much about them - he manages to expose them with heat. "Mystery Men" is actually not only funnier, not only smarter, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have believed. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for example, besides being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire of 'Mystery Men' bites when there is something worth biting and gnaws gently when there is not. He does not mock anything. That is why, contrary to what some (I must consider them as inattentive) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas. <br /> <br /> 'Super Heroes' are an attractive group. Of course, they are second-rate, but they are not just second-rate. The Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing but throw silverware at people, and he is not good at it. On the other hand, neither is it comically bad. He is better in his limited field than most people, and he practices diligently. He's not a clown, which makes him a much funnier character than if he were. If Superman is Christ on a cover, the Mysterious Men are all the smaller demigods of the foothills of Mount Olympus in layers. Much funnier; also much more captivating.
