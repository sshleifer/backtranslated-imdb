Older people show ???? I'm 15 and I've been watching it since I was 12, recording it in my Sky + box every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they had not canceled, they did not even say goodbye. But what an adventure, all these episodes, I think I've seen all of them, and it does not come to mind that I did not like and liked. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the BBC keeps switching between Diagnoses Murder and 'Murder She Wrote'- I've never watched and I do not mean to. Anyway, the characters in the Diagnoses Murder are so deep, and the chemistry between the actors is incredible. It really was a sad day when they canceled this show ........
