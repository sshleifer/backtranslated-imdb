This was the second time I watched the film (through the French version, as opposed to the first one, which was dubbed in Italian) and I feel it improves in later visions. <br /> <br /> An attractive if slowly built character study that is beautifully filmed and with Parisian settings being equally impressive. In the long run, it's not Polanski's first-rate and I would rate her at number 9 in her filmography, but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and, surprisingly, often ample comedy. Also has an excellent cast, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Even so, I'm a bit puzzled by Trelkovsky's sudden compulsion. to 'change' to the previous tenant; Aside from the owner of the cafe in front of the building, where it is given what Simone used to have without asking if he wanted any difference, there is little to indicate (as far as I could discern, at least) that's what everyone wanted from him! Okay, so he found Simone's belongings still in the apartment, but what exactly led him to wear his dresses and dress like her (even though he apparently started to do it unconsciously)? Following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom, the last section of the film (where Adjani almost disappears) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his suicide attempt as if it were a night at the Opera House. , a concept that had already been used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! <br /> <br /> The end, then, is both predictable and unresolved: what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out the window?!; I remember this factor bothering me on the first display as well, and I'm sorry to say it's not clear anymore now! Remember, the first two-thirds of the movie are pretty solid, but I wish Polanski had relied less on obscure plot points.
