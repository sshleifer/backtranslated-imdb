ROAD TO PERDITION can be summarized in the score of Thomas Newman. It's scary and beautiful, but you're aware that this song is similar to Newman's work and while you listen to the soundtrack you remember SCENT OF A WOMAN, JOE JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION do you remember other movies like story unfolds on the screen. As the Sullivans head across America trying to escape a psychopath who thinks of THE GETAWAY, Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING, while the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Although I have seen all this before, I feel this should not be taken as a heavy criticism of the Sam Mendes movie, which I repeat is haunted and handsome and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was one little confused the events that led Michael Sullivan to be betrayed. But if you stop to think about how much of a sentimental confusion Spielberg could have made with the story revolving around a father and his 12-year-old son running for their lives, you can not help but think he's a superb director Mendes < ROAD TO PERDITION is a movie where the cast gives impeccable performances. I've never been so interested in Tom Hanks, but he's as good here as he's been in any leading role, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but at no time do I believe he was seeing an American legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works because of subtle body language, his character is torn through guilt, but Newman never milks or goes over. Although never outshining Newman, who gives the best performance in the film, the two supporting actors of Britney Craig and Law are also memorable as American gangsters and although Law still has a long career as a main actor, one can imagine how Daniel Craig could have made progress. actor of character if he had not decided to become James Bond, a role that heralds the end of a career of actors
