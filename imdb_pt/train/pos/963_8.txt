Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about him making a children's film because I would hate to see him from his films that I came to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi, the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy . Lately he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he's succeeding. Still, this was the first of his films that I saw him take that direction, so I was nervous. Of coarse I bought without seeing it and I was glad I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect movie for children and adults should enjoy as well. The whole movie reminded me a lot of the movies I loved as a child: endless story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I liked these movies because they did not treat kids like they were idiots and neither did they. The underlying dark moral is there, but it's also as silly as any childish film should be. I personally was not bothered with CGI and dentures. I feel that they fit well and do not think kids will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a hard fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like this one. But I suggest giving it a try. This proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected it to be. He also continues to make his signature Miike movies out of these, which is very comforting. <br /> <br /> For people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic like this, I suggest these other films Miike: 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of the Katakuris' 'Sabu' and 'The People' of Birds in China '. <br /> <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
