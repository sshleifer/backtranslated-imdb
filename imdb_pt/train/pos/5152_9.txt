"Hitler, the Rise of Evil" is clearly produced by people emotionally free from the horrors of World War II. This makes the observation of a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think your greatest value lies in your crystalline revelation of the Nazi mechanism. From the completely corrupt ways that Hitler used to get to the top. Arriving there, this movie ends. <br /> <br /> When at the top, the 'Fuhrer' (= German for 'leader') took his Germany to the largest and most devastating war in the history of mankind. Finishing six years later in the total defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its pre-war soil), and was forced to accept a 44-year division of the remaining territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputations severely damaged by the many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of Evil" makes a good watch. Set in a thirty-year-old environment, with acting (more than) competent. In particular, the role of Peter O'Toole as the elder President von Hindenburg stands out, adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy of "Hitler, the Coming of Evil" also provides a second DVD with two good documentaries. movies. One is about Hitler's personality, the second is the forgery of Hitler's diaries. In 1983, this falsification caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, undermining the reputation of several historians and journalists.
