This is a docudrama story about Lindy Chamberlain's case and a look at its impact on Australian society. He looks especially at the problem of insinuations, gossip, and expectations when dealing with real-life dramas. <br /> <br /> One issue that history deals with is how people are expected to give the same emotional response to similar situations. situations. Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysteria for all major crises. Just because the characters in the movies and on TV act in a certain way, there is no reason to expect real people to do so. This is especially appropriate for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for the big hiccup scene that will pull the rankings. It is an issue that has to be constantly addressed. <br /> <br /> The protagonists interpret the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a great cast, all playing based on real facts. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the cast of this story are people more known in Australia as comic actors. It reinforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best support in dramas because with comedy they know how to make quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; in that I am really a former Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression of history than most. I think it is treated with incredible creativity and personality and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple is chased by the new helicopters. He captured the themes of the story brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best possible plot for his character." While this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should be applied to all who also act.
