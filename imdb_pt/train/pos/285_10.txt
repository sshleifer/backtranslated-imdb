I'd just like to say that, no matter how low the budget the movie is, it needs to be shown around the world for these movies. We do not read that much, instead, people want to watch movies. Having this series on DVD, made me want to read the whole series, and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL THE 8 MOVIES. Please do not change any of the characters, this spoils the effect. Because I've learned to love the actors who played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL THE 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message and see the message that these books and movies are here to portray. We no longer have enough. INCREDIBLE WORK !!!
