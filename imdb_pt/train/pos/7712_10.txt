Level One, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time at 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. That happened. Surprisingly, if I remember correctly, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them. <br /> <br /> Level Two, Psychoanalytic Theory. Later, as an adult, I saw the story for what it was: What if the wild and unbridled instincts that we all suppress were made manifest? <br /> <br /> Level Three, pure science fiction. <br /> <br /> The best plausible way to perceive the "What if" plot is through the genre of science fiction. This is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that go through the genre today. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all science fiction films. If planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, beware!
