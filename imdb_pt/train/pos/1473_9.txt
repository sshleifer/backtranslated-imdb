Keep in mind that any film (not to mention the documentary) that asserts any kind of truth will generate an aversive and proportionate amount of cynicism, of those to whom any suggestion or search for truth no longer makes sense, those who are already masters of psychology, cinema and captains of the soul, will undoubtedly find this film redundant, after all, you already know everything there is to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in a minority like myself, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" .... mostly brilliant, and worth watching for those interested in movies, psychology and modern philosophy One little like Scott Mclouds' "Understanding Comics", the director Sophie Fiennes, interprets the Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek in many of the specific films and scenes that he discusses. The cover is an image of "The Birds" (Zizek takes a boat to recreate the shot). <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychoanalysis does not necessarily scream, a night of a lot of fun ... But that's it! If you like movies that are ... Having some knowledge of the Lacanian psychoanalysis helps (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) are terms that are thrown rather loosely at first, but the scenes that Zizek selects and analyzes become remarkably clear what has always been for me a very abstract subject. In fact, it is probably better to be familiar with the films he is discussing than with the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Because I love, this film is not because it chooses great movies to analyze or reveal great truths about Lacan, but it shows in a very practical and intelligent way, where cinema and psychology (and by standard philosophy) become found. <br /> <br /> Why "The Sound Of Music" kind of fascist, why is "Short Cuts" about more than just class and alienation, why birds attack on "The Birds", what there is to learn about the mind of "Alien Resurrection", what makes the planet "Solaris"? What "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" have to do with each other, and what the hell is David Lynch getting into film after film ... well Zizek has some ideas. The role of the voice in "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith," is perhaps the strongest and most lucid moment in cinema when it enters female sexuality. I begin to wonder ... At one point, Zizek admits that flowers are a type of decorative dentin in the vagina, which are disgusting and should be hidden from children (joking, it seems, but ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fascinating documentary, that anyone who has ever seen a movie, and thought it meant something more than was literally said, should try to see. <br /> <br /> And anyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, this is a must too, much less dry than "Reality of the virtual", and more direct than "Zizek!", Two other pseudo-docs, about "the Elvis of contemporary cultural criticism," as he is being nicknamed, in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverted Guide to Cinema" is NOT about the role of sex in movies. Zizek claims that cinema is the ultimate perverted art, because it teaches "how to desire, not what one wishes", and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow these desires to be articulated. This is not a movie about finding reality in the movies, it is about finding the cinema in reality, and how important and exciting it can be. Hard to find, and a bit long, but well worth it, one of the most "stimulating" movie watching experiences I've ever had.
