Answer: Despite the fact that this movie was written and directed by a woman, her ex is scarier, more unpleasant and more irrational than any zombie that has ever shaken the earth. <br /> <br /> The acting in this independent film is actually very good, despite the script less than wonderful. It takes a good actor to deliver a cliche, superscript, and make it look vaguely believable. Marco's young Anthony, like Jake, performs particularly well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this movie is much better than the dialogue. Try it, especially if you're not a fan of monsters. This is not a horror movie. Even though all adult females are quite monstrous, and although all adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some previous zombie movie, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for mature adults. <br /> <br /> The whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its parts.
