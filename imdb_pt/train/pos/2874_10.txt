Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treated by her stepmother and evil sisters. One day, a ball should be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance to go, because her stepmother and sisters do not leave her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is ready for the ball with the warning to return home at midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. She and the prince later marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, launched 56 years ago, was a blockbuster, and continues to delight audiences to this day. It has a well written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including "A dream is a wish that your heart makes", "So this is love" and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" help tell the story. This was my favorite movie and did not miss anything about its charm. A true masterpiece of Disney art! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to enjoy this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, video clips, old radio shows and a restored copy of the movie!
