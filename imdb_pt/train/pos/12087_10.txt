I had a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick", buying the value of the first season (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I did, I started with the pilot and was immediately addicted after that. I rated 5 stars on Amazon, and I am evaluating 10 stars here. This is really very good. What I liked were the opening and closing themes, and of course the Stephen J. Cannell logo at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the judge and Mark as they worked together to decipher each case. I was so addicted that I also bought the second season as a companion, and I liked it the same way. If you do not have this excellent series on disk, I believe you should buy it and put it in your collection.
