The film was composed of several segments, each written and / or directed by a different director (most of whom were French, but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like "Paris", this is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), and also as "Paris'deals with New Yorkers, and why they love the They have a high level cast, featuring the likes of Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and also features seasoned veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie.
