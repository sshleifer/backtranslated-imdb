As a movie that barely costs a 4, but for movie fans from the 1940s, it's almost a must see and ranks a 9 as a variety show! I was drawn to watch this for the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Out of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put on a better song than she does here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, even if he does not see much time on the screen. It's been a while since I've seen the movie, but I was pretty sure Humphrey Bogart would show up. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep up. If you ever show up at a TV station near you, be sure to watch the sequel to Doris Day, if there is nothing else! <br /> <br />
