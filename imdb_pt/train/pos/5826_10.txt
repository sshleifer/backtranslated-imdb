I remember when I first saw this short, I was laughing so much, that with many other movies that I saw, no sound came out! Curly is very good at singing "opera" in this movie, I'm surprised he has not considered a career as a professional singer because he was very good! <br /> <br /> If you realized this was filmed near the end of Curly's career as Stooge, you could actually say that he had changed because he had lost weight and was leaner, his voice was deepening, his face was getting wrinkled, although he could still do it, it looked like he was fifty years old at the age of forty. That's because he was suffering many small scams before his big problem that ended his career. Be it even managed to pull it off on your last! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the fact that Curly was really getting really sick right now, this is really one of his funniest shorts. I know I did not care that Curly was really changing because I still thought he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
