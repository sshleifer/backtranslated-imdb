ZP is deeply related to the dream of youth represented by the hippie movement. The university debate at the beginning of the film affirms the cultural situation that gives rise to this movement. The explosion Daria imagines represents the downfall of all social structures, and hence the development of all that enormous transformation society is suffering, and finally Mark's death anticipates the end that sees it for the movement itself. The film will be more easily understood if we return to that moment in life. During the 1960s and 1970s, young people were the driving force behind the deep explorations of change. One of the most significant changes I wanted was to get sexuality out of the closet, and I think the desert scenes do not represent an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would execute in the hypothetical situation where there would be no one to hide. I watched the scene in which the couples threw sand at each other and appreciated the magnificent way A portrayed the impossibility of continuing to conceal this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social explosions at that time and that is the method, the police apply to stop the students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and this becomes clear when students gain access to weapons that ignore all false controls. The dialogue between the police officer and the university professor, who is detained without reason, shows part of the society interested in this youthful feeling and part completely disinterested. Featuring flying as the most accurate symbol of freedom, theft of the plane represents Mark's inner desire for him, but his (retreating or returning or returning (second)) shows the difficulties of getting rid of these bonds and as I said, A describes the death of the dream by these difficulties to win the game. In my point of view, a movie to remember.
