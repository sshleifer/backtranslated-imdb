The film begins with a bunch of peeps from Dead Men Walking sitting in individual cells, waiting for the inevitable reunion with death represented by the electric chair. <br /> <br /> So our "hero," who is called Tenshu, is taken to the chair, he is zapped, and then .... he is still "alive." AHA! He is given a choice by some scary military guys who look really cool: either we hit him until we're sure you're really dead OR you can walk through that door and catch any fate that might be ahead of you. " yes for option 2, and then the real story begins. He wakes up in a different type of cell (very high-tech and very large), where he finds another cellmate, who also managed to survive to the electric boogie ride A voice on the speakers says they are free to do whatever they want, as long as it happens inside that room Sounds a bit suspicious but the two men accept: What else can they do What these two men do not they know that they have been put together so that they can awaken an inner desire to kill inside them.basically the unknown scientists in the background erase them until they decide that they should kill each other. Is it strange? In fact, but there is a greater purpose for all this. it must not be revealed, and therefore it must remain undisclosed. <br /> <br /> But do not be afraid, it is the unknown that attracts the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action film, so it takes a completely different approach to the question: how long can you stay with a man who is it a SOB and would you kill it to get freedom? <br /> <br /> The first hour is basically trying to arouse your interest, it runs away without you really knowing it. It then becomes a roller coaster with action-packed WILD Matrix action scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic from which the film is based. <br /> <br /> The film is indeed very special, so special that normal movie theaters do not see it under normal circumstances. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic and the actors do their part (some more than others) to make the movie truly unique. <br /> <br /> If you must be so lucky that your movie or video store has, watch, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make conventional movies to earn huge amounts of money. <br /> <br />
