I watched this movie yesterday and I have to say it's the best horror movie ever made for $ 36,000 I've seen (Sorry Steckler) The movie definitely worth looking at if you're a zombie fan. This movie smells like soul and atmosphere. Some of the zombie scenes are the best of all time. Carcasses with dusty membranes, very scary, wander slowly to the victims who are screaming. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot fallen Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you worried before HORROR shows your corpse of the undead eating the head. This movie entertained from start to finish. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it was very short.
