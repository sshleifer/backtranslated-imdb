Being half Portuguese does not make me half blind (nor half prejudiced) when discussing Portuguese films. Not that I do it too often anyway. But this movie was an adrenaline rush! Yes, it's true - it was more precise in that the story was / goes - but it did not disturb the adventure beyond the usual territory of Portuguese films: things like using real leases in the middle of Lisbon congested by traffic and recruiting a real crowd to replace the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And by God they got it right! OK, to summarize: very emotional if you've ever gone through this, but you'll see minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot needs that were. If you are just watching randomly, you are in for a good historical joke, just the very recent type history and a little more thought than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
