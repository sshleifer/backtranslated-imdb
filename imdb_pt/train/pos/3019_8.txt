For starters, I loved göta kanal 1, had lots of classic jokes, including that unlucky guy in the canoe that always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, he's still acting the same way in the göta kanal 2 movie, but in my opinion, his performance is not as funny as in the first movie, you really do not notice him much. One thing that made me think badly about this movie is the choice of boats, in this movie there are only racing boats, sure to be fast but these do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie, I liked the old better and these new boats make one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the canoe jumps up suddenly to escape the "big waves" of those small speedy boats. Truly a minus. You have to accept that we are no longer living in the same Sweden of 1974. This movie also contains a bit more violence than the first. Although the movie was great after all. I just focused on a few cons that I was disappointed in, but the rest of the movie was up to my expectations, so go check it out! Well worth the money.
