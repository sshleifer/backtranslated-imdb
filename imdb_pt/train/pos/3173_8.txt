An imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones does not waste time in taking the viewer with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has shared an apartment with a sloppy one will be crying from laughing. Anyone who has arrived while a maid puts a note on her windshield will simply cry. We all wanted to tear off a terrible wig from a man's head. These are just snippets of what's to come when we watch "Cross Eyed," a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone to Jones and his sense of humor in front of and behind the camera.
