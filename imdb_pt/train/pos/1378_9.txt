I saw this Belgian gem two days after seeing 'American Teen'. Make no mistake, adolescence is a roller coaster, whether American or European. 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or as it is being called in the US 'Water Lillies') is a tale of a 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes resembles a young Scarlett Johansson) , retiring girl who wants to be on the school's swim team, just to be close to another cute girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane. To imagine all this is the chubby and bland friend of Marie, Anne, who only wants a boyfriend like any other girl of her age. Along the way, we are shown the usual set of teen pastimes (broken hearts, store picking, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). This is a quiet little movie that takes time to get into your system (Michael Bay fans, note: the pace here is s-l-o-w, but no problem with that, the Water Lillies is a lovely one). No rating here, but would pull down a difficult "R" due to language, nudity, adult situations.
