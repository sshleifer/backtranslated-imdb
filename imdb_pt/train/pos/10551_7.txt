Sitting, typing ?? Nothing is the last "what if?" fest hosted by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One of them is having relationship problems, has been canned from his job (because of relationship problems) and the police are trying to pick him up (because of his work and his relationship problems). The other guy is an agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his house, is greeted by an annoying guide girl who calls her mother to claim that she was molested when he does not buy his cookies. Ah yes, the police are after him too, after the mother of the Girl Scout calls them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> What if you could make it all disappear? That's the whole premise behind "Nothing." Do the two idiots see, the cops, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything? to vanish. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept, I thought. I also looked at the time of this, 30 minutes had gone in the movie, and I still had an hour in the movie. Could the 2 actors make it work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly air dead in places in this movie. But the two actors, who are long-time friends of each other and the director, have such a great repertoire with each other that it was fun to watch the dialogue and improve the playfulness around the two actors. There are many supernatural elements, but it is more their response to these elements that make this movie worth seeing.
