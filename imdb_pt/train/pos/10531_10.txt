I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were visiting Hastings because we had the desire to rent something we had never seen before and we came across this great movie. We had no idea what it would be, but it turned out to be spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the film was filmed, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I suggest you hurry to your local video store and find this movie. I'd say some of my favorite parts, but this can ruin the movie for you, so I will not. This movie is definitely on my list of top 10 movies. Do you really think nothing is buzzing?
