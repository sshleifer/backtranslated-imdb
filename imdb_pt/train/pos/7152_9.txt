'Hole' was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. All the people I talked to said they WORED. Everyone was chosen for the role they had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was just as I imagined her. everyone who has not seen I recommend and assure you that you will 'Dig It'.
