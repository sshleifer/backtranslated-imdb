One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before seeing the movie and I loved them both. It is the story of a young man getting ready to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not make a living in Ireland. It is said both from the young man's perspective (which the other characters in the film can see) and from another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings but which can not be seen by the other characters in the film. It's a very sad but deeply touching film, and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to think about. I love any Irish movie, or almost any movie about Ireland, and any movie that has the late Irish actor Donald McCann wins my vote. I'd watch that man chew chewing gum for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately, I got it. She was ashamed to have lost him so young.
