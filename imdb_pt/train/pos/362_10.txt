In 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African American girl Celie (debut paper by Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is followed by hard times. The story begins from the year 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister, Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. A widower keeps an eye on Nettie, but his father hands him Celie. It is the beginning of an age of horrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men and, especially being an African-American woman, their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Purple Color" is a masterpiece and underrated Spielberg movie. He should do more drama than "The Purple Color" and "Schindler's List" are good notion. <br /> <br /> The cast is incredible. Whoopi Goldberg is best known as a ravingly funny comedian, but the introductory role as Celie is a remarkable word she can actually pull from a heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly "Mister". I've never seen him in such an evil role. The talk show icon, Oprah Winfrey, is brilliant as a strong will of Sofia. <br /> <br /> Attention! Get ready to have various fabrics with you when watching this movie. You can actually connect to the history of strong brotherhood. Especially if you have as close a relationship with your siblings as I have with my sister. <br /> <br /> Great applauds Mr. Spielberg!
