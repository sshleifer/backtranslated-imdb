Out of the blocks, let me just say that I'm a big fan of zombies, so I do not make affirmations like the ones above. Second, let me tell you that this is an Italian zombies movie and Fulci just drove 15 minutes before delivering to Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei. This is not personal to Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> That said, this is easily one of the funniest zombie movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully horrible. Just check the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to join these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in all varieties. From loud thieves, to machetes wielding maniacs, to birds! <br /> <br /> Blood is abundant. Legs are torn, arms amputated, stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> Then you have your head in the refrigerator. Oh the head in the refrigerator! One of the biggest moments of horror ever since Ash got his hand on "Evil Dead 2". You should already know if you are the type of person who will like this type of movie. Get some mates and some beer and you'll have a fun evening. I mentioned my head in the refrigerator?!?!?
