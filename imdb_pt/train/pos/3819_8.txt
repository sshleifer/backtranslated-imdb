I waited to see this movie for a long time and finally got to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I expected a lot from this movie and that's why I was a bit disappointed. I was not the best movie in Korea, but it's still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The subject was cool and the movie makes you keep watching without getting bored, although it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon's acting is unbelievably beautiful. It was one of the best performances in movie history and I think this movie would not be cool if it was not in the lead role.
