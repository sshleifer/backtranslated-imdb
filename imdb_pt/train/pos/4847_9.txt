This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never expect anyone else to 'understand', but I'm satisfied when I recommend it and someone likes it. My late father HATED Arthur Askey, but this movie was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" transferred to me as a child. Years later, I watch from time to time, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be the same, but I'm never disappointed with that. There is so much to enjoy. The sequence on the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch continue to annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section at the station is amazing with so much going on that you have to keep up. Yes, it's dated and full of war-style Brittany in accent and plot (based on the original Arnold Ridley piece of Dad's Army fame!), But full of wonderful performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a spinster. The atmosphere is truly as sinister as a vehicle Arthur Askey could get. This is available cheaply as chips in UK on DVD to deal with. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any lazy day light piece of entertainment. I Thank You .... <br /> <br /> OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES!
