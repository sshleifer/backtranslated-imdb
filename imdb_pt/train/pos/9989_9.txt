I had the chance to see a screening of this movie recently. I think she'll be in Canada's cinemas around Mother's Day. If you are in a theater near you ... GO! It's not a funny well-being movie - it's more of a kind of a think-and-think movie. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of character development - letting you into Hagar's heart, mind, and sorrow. little by little. At first, your attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. As your story unfolds, it becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found her nice at the end of the movie - particularly when she opens her heart to the young man at the shack by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two children is painful-and reflective of it. many of our own experiences in this world. His youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure, takes the viewer to the edge of his seat - and the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see Ellen Page performing in this movie. She is very different from the young woman she plays in Juno. This gives me an even broader appreciation for his acting ability. If you loved her in Juno, you will love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is no way to express the power to act as strongly as the actor's ability to forget all the other characters they have played. Never once in the course of the movie did I think of Ellen Burnstyn - I always thought of Hagar. She involved me in her character - hook, line and anchor. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to capture on film this renowned book by one of Canada's most beloved authors is impressive. She brilliantly brings to the screen both the stone and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - the stone angel.
