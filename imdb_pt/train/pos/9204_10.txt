The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna came into the mind of Dev Anand when he saw hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his former Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was in a low mood because his film had been contested and some had burned Prem Pujari's posters. But the life of the hippies rekindled a story in Dev's mind to be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> This was Dev Anand's best directing job. The film was a blockbuster box office hit and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister made a tremendous impact. <br /> <br /> This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to uphold its moral values. <br /> <br /> This is an Indian family based in Montereal and the role of the brother is very affectionate for his sister. But the parents fight and separate leaving Prashant (Dev) with his mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with his father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she believes she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is mistreated by her stepmother and runs away from home. Dev becomes a pilot and discovers that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies. To reunite with his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz) who would marry him and also Janice who is actually Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She forgot about her childhood and Dev too. Dev has to get her sister back among all the other happenings, including her suspicion of being a thief in Kathmandu and people are after her life. <br /> <br /> This was a well-directed story and depicted by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had offered the song to be Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da did not want Dev to make the film. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari, although it was good, but he opposed it in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject, as he thought the hippie cultist movie could rekindle people's anger at Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success. <br /> <br /> RD Burman made Asha Bhosle sing the award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie.
