The sequel to Cinderella's ever-popular story reminded me a little of what they did with one of the films Beauty & the Beast. It's basically three short stories in 1. <br /> <br /> Okay, the rats are adorable (I love Gus! He's so cute!), And Lucifer is awesome (as usual). I also enjoyed some of the younger characters (Pom Pom was adorable and I liked Prudence). Still, the plot was somewhat limited, but still very cute. So I vote 7/10.
