Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story), in my opinion, this is the best of all. Almost true to the original plot - with some minor deviations and omissions, eg. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis, and the fact that Eumaeus the pig-keeper recognizes Odysseus disguised in his realistic scene, and scenery and authentic costumes contribute to this being a truly memorable masterpiece, not a B-movie of Hollywood sword and sandal . Notwithstanding the fact that dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if someone is familiar with the plot, he can still face and crown what is happening and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good Odyssey by hand). At least I did, and so much it inspired me to study the Italian language to better enjoy the film even more.
