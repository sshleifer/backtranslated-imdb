Okay, we have extreme violence Verhoeven (Although not as extreme as other Verhoeven movies), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, it lacks the intelligence that Paul Verhoeven is known for in his films. Science fiction. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most of Verhoeven's films, the film itself does not have enough humor to make it fall into the genre of comedy. The overall performance was above average compared to most horror movies. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, nor the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would make a movie. so impossible. The crew actually made an invisible man without the use of things like a floating hat suspended in piano wires and other practical effects (effects made on the set). The most impressive effects scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, they are when Kevin Bacon is becoming invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this story of the invisible man deserves to be more imaginative. Here, it occurs in a laboratory for the most part. I would have liked to see the invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and running away with it, or, say, stealing something from people's wallets or something. But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man a fun movie. Serie B
