This is a series of cartoons where most of the action takes place in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain this in more detail, you will simply have to see for yourself: I will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this as a child in the 80's (with Swedish voices). I talked to some people who were also kids in the 80's and they also loved it! I must admit that the educational part of the episodes has not come to me on a conscious level, but the idea of ​​raising children while they are having fun is wonderful. I've recently seen a few episodes; there is a humor and heart that is hard to find in other programs for children nowadays. <br /> <br /> 5/5
