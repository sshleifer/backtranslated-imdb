I liked the film in the first place because it told an interesting story, but the story told in the film seemed condensed from a much longer story. As the book has more than 400 pages, this makes sense. It covers a period of time from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictitious country of South America, also a lot to fit in the time available. I think it would have been a lot better as a six-hour miniseries than a 140-minute film. <br /> <br /> Even if it is rushed, the story does not jump so much that it gets confused. What is said is said reasonably well. One flaw is that Clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; or they should have appeared more evenly throughout the film, or should have been left out. Two other faults (which may be spoilers): Esteban's eventual return to kindness happens suddenly, and Ferula's curse seems to wear out, even if the tone of the story suggests that it should last forever. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Glenn Close, like the tormented spinster Ferula, is exceptional. Jeremy Irons, as the brutal rich man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep as the main character, Clara, is great, though often be even better than it was in this movie. There were many smaller roles well executed too. The biggest flaw is that the film seemed to lack a dialect coach; each actor seemed to speak in a different kind of accent.
