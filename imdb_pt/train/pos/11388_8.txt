As I recall, Ira Gershwin, George's lyricist and brother, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and was snapped up by the producers. In many ways, it was a typical Freed Unit 50's musical movie at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with much help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> The Gershwin were, of course, among the greatest of all time. all Broadway musical teams, but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest dancers in the musical movie (a guess as to the other?) And I can not imagine his cast being questioned. But, I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a remarkable personality in his time and, as a real friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer, as well as a remarkable neurotic and hypochondriac, and here, as always, he interprets himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was a stranger at the time and she was of the French "gamin" type. A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Guétary, who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French, but he certainly is more than OK as a French boulevardier, even if too young for the role. <br /> <br /> Gene's Hoofer's voice is useful here, but Guétary has much better vocal equipment. Although Gene is best chosen elsewhere, obviously in "Singin 'in the Rain," where his character is a lot more calculating, even here he shows up as a leap sometimes (he was, not for nothing, released as Joey's original jump on Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.) I was not so thrilled with the "I Got Rhythm" scene with the kids, it did not seem as spontaneous as it was intended in my opinion. <br /> <br /> He also found Nina Foch's character Milo quite annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the film based on the title song with costumes and costumes in the styles of the film. great French Impressionist painters. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to believe in Gene and Oscar, as distressed artists, and I do not think the musical numbers are as well set up as possible, but overall, Gershwin's music is very well served in this film . <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with very clear graphics (when they are supposed to be) and the mono sound is nice but a bit shallow.
