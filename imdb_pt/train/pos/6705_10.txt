And it's not because since her days in "Clarissa Explains It All" that I had a crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who at that time was popular was already in her twenties, but still got teen roles. "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" was Hart's next big jump after his "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic book, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who tries to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday life as a teenager. She is aided in her efforts by her two aunts and a wise-cracking black cat as she goes from high school, to college, and finally to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is the show of heart and soul. "Sabrina, the teenage witch" is quite touching and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was. I just wish there were some more recent episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
