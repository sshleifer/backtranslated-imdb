The best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who will come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision may be better or worse in our lives and in the lives of our children. The real intrusion or help of "friends" - or executioner, if we leave. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. The crazy priest who possibly is not too crazy telling what could happen according to statistics and reality. A couple who thinks of a "special" marriage, lives a painful story in their own future history. <br /> <br /> Who likes contracted marriage? No one, after the priest tells his own story? if they leave the future in other hands if they do not know what marriage is. That the problems are real, that life requires a real engagement, guarantees, of each one. That the real victims of divorce are the children, with real name, Andrea in the film, or names. That abortion is just an easy way out: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after the abortion. May the state and social security think less and less about real problems of families. The gossip of "friends", infidelity because of Steffania's weakness and despair because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think that this movie is a pessimistic movie, but no. Steffania and Tomasso, deep in their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, why do they like marriage? A truly beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: on each of their decisions, on each of the actions in their lives. The family could be a place where each one felt loved for being his, just existing. The script is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, the priest almost cynical! Excellent direction and script. The colors and management of the cameras, superb.
