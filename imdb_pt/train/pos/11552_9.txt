Here is another movie that really does not need much recommendation. It's a classic, very funny and entertaining comedy that, of course, eventually inspired a hit TV show that many would say is even better (I personally enjoy both). <br /> <br /> For some, it is difficult to warm up Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we have in these two cases are four good actors who in real life looked so much like their moviemates that they managed to make these characterizations of their own. It's the humorous material of Neil Simon that is fundamental, and where the laughs really originate. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it is the story of a neurotic and restless (Lemmon) who is expelled from a 12-year marriage by his suffering wife and resides in the apartment of Manhattan from his sloppy and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau). Placing these two unlikely roommates together on the same four walls creates some extremely funny situations.
