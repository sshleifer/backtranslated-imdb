People are being very tough on the movie. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "revise" it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his target still descends. So the fun begins when everyone on it also "falls". <br /> <br /> Think of JFK and all people associated in some way with your murder, which is life ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you will like what is implied in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent interpretation of what may have happened. Although the EXACT storyline has not been followed (hindsight here after reading Jim Maars's "Crossfire"), but it is implied that it is of interest. <br /> <br /> I would love to have a copy of it to see again. In light of what is known today, the Domino Principle is right.
