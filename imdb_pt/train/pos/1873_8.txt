The violent and rebellious twenty-five-year-old sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) is sent to three sessions for evaluation with Navy psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another explosion and aggression against a superior. Reluctant at the beginning of treatment, he receives confidence in Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing painful traumas generated in his foster home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love with each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a moving and positive story of a man who meets a friend and is sent back to normal life. The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent, making sensitive, attractive and tasteful a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, it can be a very heavy story. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Volvertando a Viver' ('Volvertando a Viver')
