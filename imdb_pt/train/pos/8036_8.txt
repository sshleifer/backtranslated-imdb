Some guys think sniper is not good because of the action part that was not good enough. Well, if you consider it as an action movie, that point of view might be quite true, since the action part of this movement is not exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action. <br /> <br /> The film told us mainly about the inside of two shooters who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed deaths, seemed to be cold-hearted. However, after Becket showed his dream of a day in Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and the sacrifice of his partners that made Becket the so-called cold heart. Millar, by contrast, was a newcomer, a green hand, and still was not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did very well in showing Millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet in the heart" (as Becket said). What he thought about the true suicide mission was that it could be easily carried out and then he could return safely and receive the prize. <br /> <br /> These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think the film had successfully shown the difference and the impact they had on each other because of the difference in their personalities. These two snipers fought, suspected each other, and finally came to an understanding by communication and what they did to help even save the other. <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie, but a good psychological.
