This is by far one of my favorite American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most others, the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college girls, and you have one in particular on your trail to rid you of your virginity "problem" and he ends up stopping in the middle of the action and rides back to sleep with your girlfriend, who stays with in mind gave you a "guilt-free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but let's be realistic; most people who watch these movies are not particularly looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> Whereas the latest chapter finally seems to notice who the audience is and the good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the movie. roses and as always Mr. Levenstein lends his "perfectly natural" eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
