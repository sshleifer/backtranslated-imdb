I've never seen it when I was a child, so this was seen with new eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it to my 5 year old daughter. Besides, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious. The special fx is tacky and the singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was in a trance. I loved to see Walken in that role thinking about what the future held for him. Very fun to watch him dance! And if the songs were not great, at least they were not the sweetness saccharine superproduced by Disney. The ogre scene at first was a bit scary to her, and she was a bit nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was almost always benign. Curiously, we recently read "The Boot Cat", and I was thinking about the implausibility of the story. But, remaining true to almost every aspect, Walken's performance made this credible. Great fun. I was watching again with my daughter.
