I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and hot. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For the first time, the director of a MacDowell movie did not make her beauty another character in the movie. The romance between Kate and her youngster is lovely to watch and works very well. Your relationship with your friends is as much a thorn as a balm in your life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been MVP in so many British films, does a great job at it. There is some tragedy in that, but I think the film is saved at the end by brilliant acting, clean direction and witty writing. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is good too, although it is not available on the soundtrack.
