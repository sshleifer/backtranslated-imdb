I was very interested in seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters, however, I was not able to get around this. Then it finally hit the shelves and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I put the DVD in the player, settled into a night of murder and pressed the play. What followed was one of the most engaging films I've seen in the last two years. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This is the story of the murders in Wonderland that led to the underprivileged parts of Los Angeles and straight into the biggest porn star of the '70s , John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the start, and the feel of the movie kept me all the way. until the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film focused less on actual murders and more on the events before and after the investigation. In addition to a few blood-splattered walls at the beginning, and the actual showing of the murders at the end, the film was more or less an engaging show of great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer almost sells me as a pornstar addicted, and even the "cute, but that's it" Bosworth was a joy to watch (and just for your appearance, you lie) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best aspect of the film was, as I mentioned, the lack of showing the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you could not completely see the brutal assault given to the sleeping quartet. Moreover, the sound effects of such murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. They were being beaten with lead pipes, there is not much more that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was the brief appearance of Carrie Fisher. His portrait of the overly religious figure was, I think, a bit too clich√©d of his appearance. Maybe that person was really part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold, and for some reason, Fisher looked a bit "clumsy" in his portrait. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent movie worth watching, even if it's a once! *** 8/10 ***
