I do not remember this movie having a movie release here. I only saw it when it came to the cable. The film deals with the dehumanization of children in killing machines. Specifically a person, the way he is replaced and dumped (literally) into a community outside the world where he finds himself unable to deal with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people expected this to be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if it were. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly glad I was not - Kurt does a good job portraying an emotional cripple. The scene in which he sits outside the complex shows this, although the decision by two replays in slow motion slows down the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie in the way Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, The Logan race or THX1138 were, however, unfortunately it's the closest I've seen in a long time . <br /> <br /> He changes the film to a verisimilar degree, it does not cut Arnie a liners, he does not become Snake Plissken and there is no happy ending definer. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie did not do well. He did not follow the formula, and among an American audience of 18 to 25 years, this is unforgivable, since that's what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> Always.
