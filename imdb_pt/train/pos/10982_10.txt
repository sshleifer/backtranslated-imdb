I found the film Gray Garden's an exciting film, an incredibly intimate approach, which shows the very eccentrics that basically have the right idea: forget about society and live in an unheated dilapidated house and a huge litter of cats and raccoons, persuading their own interests, instead, mundanely, all the time chattering on the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazy that Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> chose to document. They look like characters from a Fellini movie, just weird, if that makes any sense. Old Edie is almost completely bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She wraps herself around the house, always wearing a baboon-like hat around her head, completely covering her hair. We never see her hair all through the movie, nor did we ever get a hint that she still has a lot. At age fifty-eight, however, she is still beautiful and full of life. At Gray Gardens, we get the feeling that both women's lives have become much less than they were before. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of the two. While her mother, in her early years, married, made a family, lived luxuriously and even made some recordings (the scene in which, at age 77, she sings <br /> along with a recording of "Tea for Two "that she did decades ago is one of the best movie scenes), Edie left her promising career as a model to take care of her sick mother. At age 58, she still wanted to find her prince charming. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl, full of dreams of glamor and fame, and domestic and romantic happiness, that still have to be fulfilled. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The film's highlights include opening moments where Little Edie explains her clothing to the camera, the sequence "Tea for Two" > birthday party, the climax argument, the grocery scene and the scene in the attic. The whole thing is incredibly honest and unpretentious. And this is all the more remarkable since it's all real. <br /> <br /> I suggest seeing Gray Gardens in a row with Kenneth <br /> <br /> Anger Moment of Puce short. The Criterion DVD costs $ 35, but it's worth every penny.
