I used to write reviews on IMDb, but I do not do that anymore. It turns out that the IMDb has become massive and, consequently, subjectivity has ruined the scores. What I mean? That anyone who does not like movies and has no knowledge about it, watches some crap (or the other way around), and if he likes, he delivers a 10, and if he does not 1. This, of course, can not measure anything correctly. Now for the movie. I really regret having done a few 10s for a few movies, because then I should score one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I do not expect to see ever again in my entire life in any other film. It is simply hypnotizing, and it is not just a way of saying; it's really. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual joys and wisdom - the words spoken by the starry faces -, this really ... there is no possible match. I do not make movies, I would rarely find any sense in doing it, but this is the kind of movie you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as much as the years go by. I have nothing more to say. This is a genuine goal for me.
