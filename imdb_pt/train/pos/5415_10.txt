Home to Hollywood is best !! A classic poem by Kipling is turned into an epic adventure with memorable performances from a stellar cast. I think the measure of a good movie is how often you can watch it and still enjoy it. I've seen it a dozen times and I still cry at the end and, I admit, you too !!
