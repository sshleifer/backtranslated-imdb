I've never seen many movies online for most of my life, but if I choose any of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, a clever reference to most movies like Star Trooper (etc), using a camera, and intelligence steel, Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then put it all together with frame-by-frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas. the story begins in the middle, how do directors delight? so the middle is in the beginning, and so on, when I first watched it, I expected a full-bodied look and weird, but Jason, like me, loves looks, took every detail to the max. although I do not recommend it for children, or someone besides me would like, but please search the net (it's a short film, look up film cow), its style reminds me of south park but less violent. 10 for the visual, 6 for the laughs and 6 for the story, it all comes to a 10/10, good job <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I look forward to watching the movie.
