First of all, this movie was not released in theaters (TESTED POORLYYYYY), I say they imagined that the story of corrupt cops, politicians and dedicated journalists had been made to death, just send DVD's and cable TV> cash & run . <br /> <br /> That said, I usually like this kind of movie, especially with this cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and on the rock side, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and story were made to death, BUT the cast above brings life to this violent movie and is really watchable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a disposable newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, The others are corrupt cops and politicians or somewhat decent guys, the two ladies are the friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and do what is necessary, is quite violent, many murders etc, not for children. The film is great, BUT for what it is and the cast is definitely good, <br /> <br /> Ratings (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) )
