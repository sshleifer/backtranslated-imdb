A few years ago, I had bought (and enjoyed) the DVD of two MGM movies from the two Kolchak TV movies, THE NIGHT STALKER (1971) and THE NIGHT STRANGLER (1972). When the Universal set of the subsequent TV series came out, I had intended to buy it immediately - but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded DVD-18s prevented me from adding it to my collection; I recently placed an online order which consisted of a series of discounts on Universal Box Sets and I decided to get the KOLCHAK 3-Discer as well. <br /> <br /> Having watched now, I can safely say that I do not regret having acquired this beloved (if short-lived) crime / terror series: it can follow a standardized formula - journalist Carl Kolchak, beautifully played by Darren McGavin, enters everyone's hair with his attitude (Oakland confused Simon editor, fellow sufferers, various authoritarian figures, a multitude of monsters and villains) face the inevitable (and usually supernatural) threat, but are finally pressured to keep their story in secret - but a victory (further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits), making the show a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets provided results in specific makeup effects that sometimes leave a lot to be desired (eg the werewolf at the entrance of the same name and the crocodile creature in the last installment) - not to mention the fact that they were restricted to 50-minute programs intended for family consumption, avoids a simplified and healthy interpretation of their often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of the werewolf , once again he has never seen anyone bite but foolishly is done just to throw people around)! While the hero's cynical narration does much to attract one into fanciful plans, there is a healthy dose of comic relief involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around McGavin's relationship with Oakland or nerd reporter Jack Grinnage) - not to mention reasonable atmosphere (the setup, for the most part, is Chicago) and suspense. To make the tour even more enjoyable, there is an animated score of Gil Melle 'and Jerry Fielding. For the record, the monsters found (but not always defeated) by Kolchak throughout the series are: a revival Jack The Ripper, a variety of cults (Voodoo, Native American, Aztec), aliens, vampires, werewolves (giving back to their familiar concept by having this particular episode fully assembled on a cruise!), Doppelganger, satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, monkey, witch, biker without head, succubus, armor of a knight taking a murderous life (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast - featuring John Dehner as a grumpy police captain, Hans Conried and Robert Emhardt), Helen Of Troy (!) and crocodile. Some of the actors (besides those who play Kolchak's co-workers) return in the same roles - Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri (both as law enforcement), John Fiedler (as a clever clerk of the morgue) and Richard Kiel as two distinct enemies of the hero. If I was pressured to choose the best (or most entertaining) episodes, I would lean to HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS (co-starring Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer) and the aforementioned THE KNIGHTLY MURDERS - while, as the weakest, I would go to WEREWOLF (due to reasons I have already explained) and CHOPPER (based on a story invented by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale!). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the set does not contain extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in KOLCHAK: THE STIGHT STALKER as well as putting the series in the context of where the TV was at the time of its original display, or even denoting the enduring influence it has had on the seemingly endless series of the popular science fiction series nowadays. In fact, Kolchak himself - much younger and ostensibly more somber - returned in a revival in 2005; this version is available at my local DVD store ... but, for various reasons, I'm not sure I'd check it out right after the 1974-5 classic!
