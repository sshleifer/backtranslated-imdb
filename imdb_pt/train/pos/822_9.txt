The last film in the Lucas saga is a spectacular-looking production. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it's a step up from episode IV (and only one rung below episodes III and V). Actually, I think it's the third best movie in the 6-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a great fun movie. It is not a movie with beginning, climax and end; the mechanism of the film operates with only one goal in mind: to close the universe of Luke. There's an air of purpose attached to the whole thing, which makes the movie a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Besides, it's a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and the old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as always) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is the inner conflict of Luke (and Vader) that gives the saga its backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. I'm glad that Lucas has given up on the idea of ​​making episodes VII, VIII and IX because this movie is a great support for a long, fascinating and captivating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinee style.
