No message. No symbolism. There are no obscure trends. Just a wonderful melange of music, nostalgia and good fun gathered by people who obviously had a great time doing it. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage that is being mined by the studios. It is clear that everything is worth watching with the incomparable Judi Dench. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes on my movie shelf to be taken out again anytime, I feel the need for a warm experience and a good laugh of good nature. Just a wonderful movie!
