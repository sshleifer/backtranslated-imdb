"FULL HOUSE", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've ever seen all the episodes, but I still liked it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you wonder how that made it so funny, you would have to have seen it for yourself. It was a two-parter, so you should have seen both sides. Another of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) are locked at a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You would also have to have seen for yourself if you want to know how and why this happened. I have many others that I like too. Everyone always performed well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend that you take it just in case it exits the air forever.
