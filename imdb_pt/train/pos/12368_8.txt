I had the TV for a white noise companion and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment" So I ran into the TV room expecting another movie from the 70's and got a lot more. Fortunately, I could go back to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to watch it completely (Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) In addition to some holes in the story and improbable intermittent dialog / events, this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Very frightening and progressive at times: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played expertly by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs, in a very bloody way, his father, an explicit scene of a little boy and a trio. watch) The film is TOTALLY 70 full of bad clothes (polyester suits and tacky ascots) and decoration, bad hair, more swollen music, and family-like cinematography. The cast is great, take a second on the home page of this movie to check it out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles, always wonderfully creepy! APPRECIATE!
