Before Lost everything that appeared on the TV was predictable. You could predict who would die or who would find something, but in Lost you could predict NOTHING. Every thing was so amazingly impressive and it really was a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. I literally got addicted to it. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to each week. It's cool. The bright environment is calm and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are a work of genius, each one of them especially those who are already on the island. The castaways are so dramatic but we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and more to say and they have secrets that affect the other castaways who die with them.
