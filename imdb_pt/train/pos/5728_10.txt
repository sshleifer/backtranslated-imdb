I went to this movie expecting a scary movie. What I got was scare after the fright. It's a horror movie at its core. It's not boring like other horror movies where a haunted house has ghosts and blood. This movie neither shows most of the deaths shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept is that it's not just the house that haunts anyone who enters the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some of the external comments, I'm really surprised that critics did not like this movie. I'm going to see him again this week and I'm excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror movie should. That scared me a lot.
