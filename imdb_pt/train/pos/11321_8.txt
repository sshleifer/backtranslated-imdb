When I started to watch the show I said "Oh no, it's as tacky as Elfen Lied and not even bloody!". And, in fact, the setting is almost identical, with the single boy living alone in a big house and suddenly engaging in a fantastic adventure while sexy girls come and live with him. <br /> <br /> It's where the resemblance stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as that of Inuiyasha, while the comments and childish behaviors are very few. The magical setting is a bit cheesy, because there are about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all being servants someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. darkens and disappears from the beauty of the drawing and script. <br /> <br /> In fact I watched all 24 episodes in a day and, without comparing it with animes that I liked more, but were of other genres, I have to say that I was very pleased.
