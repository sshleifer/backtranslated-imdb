We watched this movie for the first time as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we did not think it was extraordinary. Watching him for the second time, we find a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film takes place on one of the darkest days in Argentina, when the DeLaRua government was ending. The country was in turmoil after the economy, which had flourished in the early 1990s, under the climate artificially created by President Menen. It was a time when dollar bank accounts were frozen and people lived a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins exactly when Santamarina, a bank employee, is dismissed because of the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, she locks him from the apartment and he, for all practical purposes, becomes a homeless man. He takes to the streets trying to survive. <br /> <br /> The other story features Ariel, a young Jewish man interviewing for a job at a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle that he gets the job. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of "El Once" in the center of the city. Things go from bad to worse, when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela, the young woman who is in love with Ariel, comes to help father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, who is a clean man, has to resort to bathing wherever he can. He chooses a ladies bathroom in one of the subway stations. When the attendant, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she regains her senses when she realizes the unfortunate circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They get romantically involved, and Santamarina, in one of his trips through the garbage in the street, finds a child. Elsa, though surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives that will cement their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who met beautiful Laura at work, begins a turbulent and cumbersome sexual affair with her beautiful co-production. worker, whom he did not know, is involved in a lesbian case. Ariel, who releases spears photographing weddings and other occasions, feels a passion for Laura, but realizes what Estela has sacrificed to help her father and still loves him. Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido" we thought was excellent, did wonders with this movie. Things are put in their proper perspective after a second screening recently and we should apologize for not having noticed it the first time. The second time, the nuances of the screen written by Burman and Emiliano Torres, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, collaborated with Mr. Burman before surprising results. He is not a "beautiful movie star," but he is handsome. This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise. Your Santamarina is disarming. Despite all the bad things that have fallen on him, he maintains a rosy attitude towards everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors, plays the small part of Simon. The beautiful Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Waiting for the Messiah" proves that Daniel Burman is a voice to be recognized in Argentine cinema.
