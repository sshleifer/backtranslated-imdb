Having never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this film on a clean slate. And I must say I really enjoyed it. Of course, some of Sondre Locke's acting made me a little squeemish - but, hey, it was the '80s. But even if you can not get through it (and I barely got it) or your revenge killings (which seemed a bit ... exaggeration; P), worth just for Dirty Harry. Or at least the bull dog he affectionately calls 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
