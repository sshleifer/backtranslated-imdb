A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and need to deal with an evil teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and a hell of a great secret. <br /> <br /> Okay, so, technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It is very fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (involving corn) happen, people freak out because of kittens, there are bad lines, there is too much cheese to hold! <br /> <br /> So, yes. You'll like this. Very. He will not move you, touch you, scare you or upset you anyway, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!
