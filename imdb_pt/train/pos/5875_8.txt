These are one of the movies that do not require brain or thought, it's a very funny time pass that you forgot in the next hour. I was really surprised by the acting of John Abraham, who usually plays the gangster character with emotionless face, so to do the opposite and do it successfully, managing to shine among geniuses like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also very surprised with the 3 girls of Akshaye because there the roles do not require much talent, but mainly lamenting about the disappearance of Akshaye (for the other girls) I was surprised when they managed to establish and persona real and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing, also most songs are good, it's colorful and fun so on a boring Sunday night, this will surely ease your mood.
