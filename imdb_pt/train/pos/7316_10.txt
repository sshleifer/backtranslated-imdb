This movie is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is great, the music is as good as the movie and the killer is as scary as it can be! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr. Loomis, he made the movie even better. Without it, the movie would be missing out on a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as our beloved screaming queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the true evil behind her until she finds her friends murdered roughly in the house, which of course is one of the best scenes in the movies. It performs tremendously. I loved this movie, since it scared me when I saw it in the early 80's and I still watch until today, since it's a wonderful movie that brings you to this world where you could be gutted like a fish. on every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a crazy man in a mask that escaped a mental asylum and is ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there is just terribly shocking and takes him even more to the film as the events that fiction could easily come true. We all know that unfortunately evil exists in this world and a madman with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing and profound fear of it all. Death at any moment. Halloween, of course, shows this in the most terrifying way. The horror must be believable, and that's what makes the movie enjoyable. It is just a simple story that is transformed into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as superb plot of Psycho, both of which I love, I believe the formats are the best horror has to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I have ever seen and I will watch them all my life and never get bored of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
