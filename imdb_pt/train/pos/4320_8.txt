This highly underrated film is (to me) what good writing on a film should be. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and exposes everyone to see and admire. The film is about the divisions people create to isolate themselves from the violence, hatred and fanaticism of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way, we are asked question after question about life. Davis (Steve Martin, with a big beard) asks himself, "Am I making a violent movie (and, by extension, our pleasure in it) causing violence in society?" Claire asks "What kind of world throws something as precious as human life?" Mack is not immune when he asks, "Is it possible to go beyond the limits of race and (an even harder step) to finance?" Of course, they are not mentioned in the film, but generalities, others ask their questions as well, and to be honest it raises more than respond. <br /> <br /> But that is the nature of life. <br /> <br /> We strive for a lifetime to find answers to questions that we will never fully answer, and in certain cases we will have to answer our questions. As humans, we thrive on issues we can not answer. Some answers are real. Claire and Mack come to realize that although they can take the easy way out and let the state take the baby, their discovery puts the responsibility for their life in his hands, some answers are not, Davis "sees the light" and decides not to make violent films, but the next day he turns and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art. Everyone seeks answers, This one film does not answer them, it simply reminds them to keep looking for the answers. <br /> <br />
