Elegantly driven, photographed picturesque and brilliantly acted? The interpretation of Crosby looks exactly right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is ​​a treat too ?? the appeal of this Yankee is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> One of the main joys of the film, of course, are the songs. As you would expect, Bing is in a good voice. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing in a hearty way as he dances happily with Crosby and Bendix in his famous novelty number, "Busy Doing Nothing." It is also a pleasure to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, while enjoying an extensive stage career and singing shows, rarely had a chance to be heard in the movies. She has a charming voice that more than matches her sweeping appearance and she looks very attractive, in fact, in her Mary Kay Dodson outfits. Director Tay Garnett makes the most of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his command to present each fabulous scene in the most effective way possible. (Maybe the eclipse looks a bit too artificial, but who's complaining?) In short, as the trailer really describes, a pleasure of entertainment from start to finish.
