If you like cars, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some superb actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical attitude without absurdity and hardcase appearance. The others are not bad either ... There are only two minor flaws in this movie. Firstly, the poor plot, however people do not watch this movie for the plot. Second, the glorification of grand theft auto (automobile crime). However, if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, then, good look at them, hope you have a good time in jail! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was to act the main role, I first thought "... sweeet", but then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" but then finally, after watching the movie I realized "... yes, it sucks!". Just kidding he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I will end this unusual review by saying: "If the untimely death of a criminal somehow illuminated the general cinema going audience as to the sombre finish down the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death brings with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory.All must be so fortunate You can say "Poor Criminal" I say "Poor of us" ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty cool!
