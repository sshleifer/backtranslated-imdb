"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastically disgusting, trashy and energetic Z-grid production that every self-respect camp horror freak simply has to see for himself / herself! The ideal way to describe that low-budget 70's jewel is like a sassy copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times more filthy! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission, but ends up being a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... makes him melt! In a state of shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve leaves the hospital, leaving a trail of pus sticky and fallen from body parts behind. Dr. Ted Nelson needs to find him urgently, since the disease has also put Steve with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound totally stupid, but this movie is extremely entertaining and contains great makeup effects from the hands of Rick Baker. The face of the melted guy looks like rotten pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that the screenplay by William Sachs does not waste time with tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this gem of horror and try to turn off your brain activity as much as you can, because if you start thinking about the many bullshit in the script, you will lose all the fun!
