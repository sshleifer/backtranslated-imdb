Let me make one thing clear. "Most of the time, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly impresses me in general, and more specifically, the treatment of beloved and iconic movie characters. comic book pages. Because? Well, let's take a typical Hollywood executive board meeting to illustrate, shall we? <br /> <br /> Executive No. 1 'Hey, there are a lot of dollars to be extracted from superhero movies these days.' <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Good point, let's do a hurry then! ??? We're going to take a lucky dip in a hat and randomly pick a superhero to base a movie on! (The dive takes place and a famous name of superheroes is removed) <br /> <br /> Executive # 1 'Great! Now who can we play the part? <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Who is a big box office star right now?' <br /> <br /> The executive name of the great actor is the thing of the past week. <br /> <br /> Executive # 2 But does he really fit the role? I mean, he does not look like the character. <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Who cares?! He is a great name; We'll do the movie with him anyway. <br /> <br /> Executive # 2 You're right! And in addition, we will fill the entire movie so as to get filled with flashy special effects to appease the dumb masses that no one will ever question you anyway! <br /> <br /> The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons why I usually hate most modern superhero movies. All the style, no substance and simply pathetic cast of the iconic links. Of course, to be equitable, there are exceptions to the above rule; when does Hollywood work? take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies. <br /> <br /> But back to the general negative features exhibited by Hollywood today ?? .. would not it be wonderful if our studio executives would ALWAYS choose actors who really fit the roles? Well, in this less-than-ideal world, a filmmaker does just that, believe it or not, casting actors based on their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts. Her name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately (but typically) Hollywood still has not allowed Collora to direct a feature film, but fortunately for us, he has given us tempting glimpses of the end result probably in the form of two (so far) famous short super-resources. One is the superb Batman: Dead End and the other is this simulated trailer from an entirely fictional movie called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not measure our words here ?? this is absolutely incredible! The cast of the Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn, (who looked equally impressive but was totally wasted on the barbaric dull) makes the most perfect choice to Play the iconic man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical resemblance, there has certainly never been a closer approximation of the comic character. <br /> <br /> Added to this, Clark Bartram is back to his splendid portrait as the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead. End; Once again, another extremely careful piece of selection! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ??? If this were really a real and complete movie! Hollywood studio executives? take note! This is how it should be done! As a final note, I am once again intrigued by the broadly divided reactions that this short film evoked from the fans. Surprisingly, the most bitter and vehemently adverse reactions to it come clearly once again (as in the case of Batman: Dead End) from a younger, less experienced movie audience; a fact betrayed by his somewhat grammatically primitive discourses and liberal use of basic diction. Such a pitiful closed-minded state is indeed a sad phenomenon, though one of our studio executives in Hollywood undoubtedly derives great satisfaction. After all, those same misguided individuals are in all likelihood exactly the same kind of computer addicts, popcorn-stuffed jerks who amuse themselves in most of the crap that Hollywood produces by the flood these days.
