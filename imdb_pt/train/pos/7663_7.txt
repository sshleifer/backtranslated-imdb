As a rule, the Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But because I liked Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but that's something else. The film involves a fight with a mystic (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and does this to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard was blinded. Your eyes are ruined holes. Then the magician runs his hands through the eyes of the other, and hey, that's it! Your eyes have been restored! This type of healing apparently only works with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" animate a pair of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one wins. <br /> <br /> However, next to that, the picture is not all bad, albeit a lot like a comic book. Dr. Mordred's most "human" adventures are fine, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen much worse.
