and what a combination. Two of the great singers of the century star together in this understated musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and both work for Basil Rathbone, who also can not write because his wife died (in fact, she ended up getting fat!). Best scene is the number of the pawn shop where Bing sings an improvised number while the swing band takes their instruments from the hock. Just wonderful. And this is a rare lead role for Broadway legend Mary Martin, and she's very good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again the maniacal pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram co-star. And who knew Rathbone could be funny?
