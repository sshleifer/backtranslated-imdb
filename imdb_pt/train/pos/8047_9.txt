I came across this movie by accident and enjoyed it very much. The character of Timothy Busfield does not have redemptive qualities, and at one point, Busfield and the star Meloni watch women as they pass by ... Meloni's parade in the parade is different from Busfield's. Janel Maloney is great ... She looks a lot like Tea Leone, but the big difference here is that Janel can really act. Some very cool things in this movie and are worth your attention when you're on cable.
