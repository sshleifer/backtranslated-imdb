Oh, it's so cool to see a Quiet Classic once in a while! Director Vidor is simply delicious and even makes a long (at least for 1928) like himself. The story is about succeeding in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio. It becomes a great star and the consequences are really alienated from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (poor) past! The appearances are simply hilarious, certainly the scene in which the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that she does not look so special ... Must be one of the first movies here and movies for freaks Real is amazing to see the cameras and stuff from a long time ago. A must if you ask me !!
