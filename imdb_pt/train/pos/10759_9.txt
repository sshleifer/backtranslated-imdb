It's true that you always remember what you were doing at a time of disaster or tragedy. And nothing more than September 11, 2001, a date that changed the whole global landscape in its fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary did not set out to focus on the events that led to 9/11. Instead, the filmmakers, brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet, began to make a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie firefighter from New York. They had gone to the gym and did some training, and they had hand-picked their "proby" (probation officer) to join them at a NY firehouse, home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production should develop and contain at that moment. time, is believed to be the only photo of the first plane crashing at the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I was traveling back with a friend on the train one night of LAN games, and I received a call from about 850pm my father's local time, which informed me about the above. A few minutes later, he told me that there was another and that the WTC was being attacked. When I got home, the upper floors of the twin towers were on fire and in the smoke, and to my horror, they collapsed, less than an hour. The filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one that had followed a staff on a routine call, and who immediately rushed to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. We followed a possible sequence of events in the WTC1 lobby, where first responders, firefighters, paramedics and police had to make sense of what had happened and quickly develop a plan of action. The other camera, held by the other brother, was going to the WTC to look for his brother, and along the way captured the many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten. <br /> <br /> Placed throughout the documentary, there are numerous interviews with the men of Escada 1 and Motor 7, who miraculously did not suffer any accident. But the survivors have also brought their own psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event. Through the events unfolding, we learn about the strong camaraderie between these men who risk living and fighting every day in their jobs, to save lives. <br /> <br /> We began with what the documentary should be, before The events of the day were totally influenced and became the focus, until the rescue phase, where the hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by men who work 24 hours a day to understand the steel structures that have collapsed. It's not a movie that is made, and what you see here can not be recreated in any other documentary (and skies, nor sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters). It's as close as you can get to that day by witnessing the up close, security event. <br /> <br /> Code 1 DVD contains an extra hour separated from 4 sets of interviews with the ladder 1 men and 7 engine.
