This is what I expected when the Star trek DS9 debuted. Do not light DS9. This was a wonderful show by itself, but it never gave the fans more than they wanted. Enterprise is this show. Although it bears a resemblance to the original walk, it differs enough to be original in its own ways. This makes exploration ideas exciting for us again. And that was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient to success was the relationship that evolved among crew members. Viewers really cared deeply about the team. The company also promises a lot in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. Although the sexual tension in a program can often become a crutch, I feel that the tensions in the company can lead to much more and say a lot more than is typical. I think that when we deal with large-scale characters of different races or species, even, we have some very interesting ideas and television. In addition, we should note the performances, Blalock is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really has a whim and strength of character that provides great performance. The rest of the cast also performed well. My only complaints are as follows. The theme. It's good is different, but a little heart light for my taste. We need something a little bigger. It does not have to be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound is enough. And my other complaint. They sell a lot of extras. They could fix this by selling fewer ads or making all of the shows two parters. Otherwise, we will end up watching the final act of the show being wrapped up very fast, as was one of my complaints from Voyager.
