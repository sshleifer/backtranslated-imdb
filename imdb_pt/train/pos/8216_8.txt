*** After two digressions ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in "Sudden Impact," an exciting thriller that wisely plays with its strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends enough time on display and reserves its energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> For the first time, the case takes Harry outside his hometown, San Francisco (where he is once again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask after" tactic) the village of SÃ£o Paulo. There, a group of delinquents are being horribly murdered, one at a time, by a woman they raped for years before, and whose sister has been in catatonia since the attack. /> <br /> The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke, and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-blood. Locke's cold eyes and cold voice, when they try to comfort his hospitalized sister or take revenge on the rapists, are very effective at painting a portrait of an unjust woman whose years of suffering and anger are now beginning to bear fruit. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The rapists are despicable, especially the leader, who has a "crazy psychotic" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who looks almost like one of the guys, despite his anatomical inability to participate. The flashbacks, although not graphically explicit, are a nightmare, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer Jennifer while she killed her assailants. <br /> <br /> Some will reject "Sudden Impact" as trash: a stupid, tale of manipulative revenge. On a certain level this is true, but it's a crap. What works to the advantage of the film is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in his paintings than in his gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You can take away or leave the idea that some mistakes deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but how the mystery behind the killings becomes clear to Harry (an understanding that is wisely not said with dialogue), he is presented with a choice - what to do with a murderer whose motives he may sympathize with, but whose conduct he is obliged by law not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than Dirty Harry's usual food. <br /> <br /> The other redeeming quality of the film is the direction of Eastwood. This is, after all, a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The film is directed with style and intelligence, and edited to give the action scenes a great reward. Some of Harry's best "moments" throughout the series are here, including Harry's best-known line, "Go ahead - make my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a film that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It's also a fascinating detective story, well done and well told. And it certainly is not dull. On these criteria, he succeeds tremendously.
