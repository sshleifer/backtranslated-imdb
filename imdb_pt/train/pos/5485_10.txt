One of the most timely and engaging documentaries you will watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look at the political dynamics that prevail throughout the Western Hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the history of the "US-backed Latin American coup," this film tells in real time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political knowledge and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insights offered by this film are invaluable. Clear examples of private media are obtained as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor of Caracas facing the brutal realities of "American politics." There is a clear sense of impending doom if people can not deal with the flagrant tyranny that has been abruptly and illegally imposed upon them by the conspirators. We also see arrogance and fascism, private media, plutocrats, and CIA-backed generals, who conspired to bring Venezuela back into Washington's domination. Although cleverly led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez has been kidnapped by renegade generals. Your response is the highlight of the movie. If anyone looks for a great picture of what the US government, Hugo Ch√°vez and revolutionary Venezuela is, this is the movie!
