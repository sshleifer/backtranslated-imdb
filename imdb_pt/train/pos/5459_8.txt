BABY FACE is a quick, wise reasoning, knowing the smile of a movie that lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh, how clever 75 minutes they are! That a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a short time that most of today's filmmakers are embarrassed. Today's writers should study the economics of BABY FACE and reduce the swelling that so many of their films burden. <br /> <br /> The story is not absurd. An amoral woman rises first to wealth, and then to the bodies of men who fall madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> Of course, the production code seduced him with a happy and redemptive ending, <br /> <br /> but it's not hard to see which direction the writers wanted to go, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is fantastic, as is George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as an unhappy suitor. Not a great movie, but certainly a nice movie. If you have never seen the BABY FACE pick it up the next time it is shown on the cable or rent the cassette. It's worth the effort ..
