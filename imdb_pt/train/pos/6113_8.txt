After having seen "Marrying Mafia", I almost lost my faith in the Korean film market. But this one brought my faith back. <br /> <br /> A leading female character, a college student, forced to teach the pampered, rich but grumpy schoolboy. He is actually the age of the female character. Through some hilarious fights, these two end up being great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that the newcomer Kwan sang woo did his work with excellence. It was such a revelation !! Actress Kim Hanul was also charming as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie tried to avoid any clich√© that could be seen in typical romantic comedies. And he did not show us unnecessary scenes of nudity and sex. It was brilliant, lovely, fresh, made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
