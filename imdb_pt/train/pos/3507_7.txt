"Victor does not have much, but that does not stop him from trying to date Judy, the prettiest girl on the block. All he has is hope and a one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family. , his brother adores him, and his half-sister has just declared war.But Victor thinks love can really win everything in this warm, genuine, touching romantic comedy about city life that most people never see "for the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett's "Raising Victor Vargas" produces "premiere" performances of lead actor Victor Rasuk (as Victor Vargas) and the cast. Rasuk and juicy Judy Mars (as Judy Gonzalez) are sexy and affectionate as "Lower East Side Kids" discovering the joy of sexual attraction. Considering how attractive they look in this picture, it is not difficult to predict that they connect - and though you may wonder how "innocent" they really are, their characterizations seem true. <br /> <br /> Victor's brother "Nino" is played by Victor's real-life brother Silvestre Rasuk, who looks like the older brother's role. Sometimes it's good to see movie brothers who really look alike; and we hope they work together again. "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs" sister Krystal Rodriguez (as Vicki) and old world Altagracia Guzman (as grandma) complete the family of Dominicans hungry for sex. So the camera ripening movies are in vogue, or what? <br /> <br /> Raise Victor Vargas (5/16/02) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, July Mars, Silvestre Rasuk
