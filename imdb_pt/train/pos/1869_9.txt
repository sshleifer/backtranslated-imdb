Antwone Fisher's story of neglect and abuse in childhood is an inspiration to all who have witnessed or even experienced the suffering of foster children. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone never knew his father. Growing up with "church going" abusers who use the "n word" not only to intimidate and hurt, but also as a loving term, as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in an attack, suffering racial slurs and being provoked while serving in the Navy, Antwone's anger is slowly transformed into positive power when advised by a Navy psychiatrist, and a love comes into her life. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Antwone meets her biological mother is one of the film's most powerful moments. Stunned by the unexpected confrontation, the woman hears in silence to hear the young man tell her how she lived a life without crime, drug addictions, children of the left and right, despite all the adverse circumstances. <br /> If this scene was not powerful enough, the next one takes it home (and opens the floodgates): A reception to receive the Antwone house; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages conveyed by this wonderful film is that there are many sincere and well-meaning people working to help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the houses and administrators do not seem to care and seem selfish, many give their all. The character who found Antwone's "archive" as he revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD includes a track in French, several subtitle options. , as well as additional resources and information about adoptive parents. Like a Clevelander, I enjoyed the local footage. No matter where you are from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical jewel.
