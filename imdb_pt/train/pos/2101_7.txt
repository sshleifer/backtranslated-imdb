Forget Neo and Bourne and all those modern heroes invented in half. They only seem to be 12 years old to please the broad audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. As they can not be Rambo, McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a lot of fakes that have no beard and still meet teenagers who want to see something that looks a lot like an action movie. <br /> <br /> "action scenes" are painful to watch and any girl can challenge her manhood without question. That explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens in recent years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, get ready ... had no beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say it's time that a new hero went up and put his reign at an end. This movie "Largo Winch" is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley made a very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he was weakened is when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case. <br /> <br /> I did not know that when I entered the theater, but this may be the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, a film can be well crafted and rooted in the B genre without blushing for its performance. Meanwhile, all we had to chew was a giant pile of manure or something too narrow to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, remember I believe that "Largo Winch" has everything to be popular and quality. I left the theater very satisfied and hungry for more.
