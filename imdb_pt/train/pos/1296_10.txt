It's an extremely difficult movie to watch, particularly because it targets the deepest core of all our lives. But finally it's a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Anyone who finds it cynical I have to say that they must have lost a lot of sense of the whole message of the movie. For those who actually watch the movie, they will see that the way in which the problems are handled is absolutely necessary, and the result is ultimately edifying. Of course, it is very difficult to watch, a difficult and even brutal subject. However, it is extremely relevant to society and to all. It shows the peak of what the world cinema is doing at the moment (I will not restrict that term to France only) and everyone should try to see it. I'll say it's best to come in with a clear head without being swayed by conflicting views, and just let the movie work for you.
