hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on t.v as I think she's fine. I am a real fan of Sabrina the teenage witch too, so it helped my watch it (do not ask). I love the way Nicole plans for her parents to kill very tenderly, since she makes sure someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she will not give her fingerprints (a very well thought out idea) back, I think it all came out back when she was caught when her old boyfriend appeared and put a camera hidden under his shirt. I give this movie a nine out of ten, and put it on my list of the top 10 movies. And last but not least, if anyone sees this movie in the stores, please tell me how I saw it on television and did not record it. bye
