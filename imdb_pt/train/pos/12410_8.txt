This is a prime example of what can be done in a small budget film. The acting is excellent considering the script and the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. The blood is well made and used in moderation (beware of the great death of barbed wire) and the action is strong when used. It is true that there are dishonest lines in the script at times, but compared to other films with the same (or higher!) Budget, it is hardly noticeable. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
