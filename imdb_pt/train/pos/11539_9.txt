THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous piece about a TV newcomer named Felix Unger, who is an obsessive eccentric, who lives with his best friend divorced, Oscar Madison, a sports writer and complete after his wife Frances throws him out of his apartment. Once divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets the moment he does. Neil Simon's classic comedy came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes on Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny on paper but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the unfortunate figure that is Felix Unger. Matthau was fortunately allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, a unique jewel of comedic performance that provides consistent laughter everywhere. This team of Lemmon and Matthau became comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films. With both actors no longer with us, the visualization of this classic becomes more touching, but not less hilarious. Simon's piece was well expanded to the screen, with a silent prologue chronicling the suicide attempt of the depressed Felix who is a winner. The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar poker friends and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon sisters, blind dates of Oscar and Felix. Of course, it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there's nothing like the original. A joy from beginning to end.
