Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire in the mating game, twisted and turned inside out. The critical critique of the film in the media's publications as "offensive" and "cheeky" serves only to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It's in the tradition of what I call "reality-based" satire following in the footsteps of "In The Company of Men," "Chasing Amy," "Your Friends and Neighbors," and "Two Girls and a Guy." Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was intrigued by the ease with which he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three sex-obsessed predators who, along with their newly married friend (superbly played by Judah Domke), are turned upside down by their own predators (Amanda Peet). Beneath the satirical surface lies a much more satisfying romantic comedy than most studio-coated sugar products.
