So finally I know it exists. Along with the other contributors from the UK here I saw this about what should have been just the UK's selection in the 1970s. I remembered the title but got nowhere when I mentioned it to people. That scared me (they're 2'r's), but when you go to bed with the doom buzzing over your brain and listening all over for impending terror, then is not that what a REAL CLASSIC horror movie is? I can barely remember the intricacies of the movie, but what I remember is my shivering flesh and keen senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? Again, if anyone has any information on how to get a copy of this, please contact ...
