I love watching this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the kidnappers. I like birds of prey because they are scary. My favorite parts are those where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the movie Friday the 13th with the girl who eats the banana. <br /> <br /> I really love watching this movie a lot because the computer graphics seems a bit fake, but okay, because once you enter the movie, you do not even realize what's happening and I think you have one good ending, even if I did not understand what was happening First couple visions I discovered over time and that's the important part. The other important part is how dinosaurs can be scary if you are watching for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE.
