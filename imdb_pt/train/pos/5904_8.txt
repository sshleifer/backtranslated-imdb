I was hoping to see this movie a long time. It's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I really think it was very well done. Most conventional romantic movies end with lovers finally getting married or starting a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and life. This is what this movie is about the period when a newly married couple Fardeen and Esha get married through an arranged marriage and start their life with their honeymoon. The acting is really lovely, though I think Esha stood a little still and she could have used some lines to herself. The story was well made and the dialogues were more or less appropriate. The editing and the direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To summarize, I'd say it's a good drama cum novel, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean artist.
