What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know you will win one or two tide movies during the Christmas season and most of them will be terrible. This movie is definitely a new idea that was very well taken. A very funny take on a rich young man paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What's the good of having money like that if you can not do fun things with it? It was a win-win situation. A normal family earns six digits and a rich guy experiences Christmas as he imagined. Only if. Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and was just a riot to see the family reluctantly meet their absurd demands. It was a funny and funny movie.
