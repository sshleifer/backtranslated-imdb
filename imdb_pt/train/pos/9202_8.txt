One must admit that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He paused for Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also former winner of the beauty pageant title, putting it in a paper, which was tailor-made for his debut. Her gaze of glasses and glasses, and she swaying with the mesmerizing music, made her an instant darling of the spectators. This film is a treat for the eyes, with its scenic locations, ethnic people, the temples of Buddha and disobedient and disobedient Mumtaz who looks quite attractive in their ethnic wear and dance skills. Dev of course, adorable, and this is one of his commercially successful performances. Hare Rama manages to keep interest, with his carefully written script, editing and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his other film, Anand dealt with the subject of young addicts, and their theory of troubled families and troubled childhood is plausible. A good artist, this film retains its freshness to date!
