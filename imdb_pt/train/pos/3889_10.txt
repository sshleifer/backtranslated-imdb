Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedy genius, and this is Eddie at his best. His material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is one of the best ever seen onstage. Instead of insulting the public's intelligence, he trusts him to take the mood out of his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing, and the British. With so many memorable laughter, we can not fail to repeat some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. All high-level comedy fans need to see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British comedian I've ever witnessed, Eddie Izzard has fought for off stage success live. However, his lack of commercial success in the movies should not be indicative of how extremely talented he is genuinely. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure trove, which fortunately found its way into the home video, and can and should be enjoyed again.
