Chase created a real phenomenon with The Sopranos. Ruthless attitudes, solid writing and good music make up what has become the greatest show of all time. <br /> <br /> All the casts are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have every inch of the Emmys. Anyone who doubts that needs only to experience a few episodes; particularly of the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying, and you still find yourself loving him - hypnotized by him. Many people I've talked to about The Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) will say "I'm not a fan of movies / mafia shows." Whatever. Run, do not walk, and take. These same people generally love "E.R." but I bet they do not care much about hospitals ... It's not about context.
