Dark Angel is a futuristic science fiction series set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, centered on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced young woman, running away from her creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe is absorbing, (not so much as Buffy says, but absorbing, though) with an interesting and believable set of characters. Certainly not for everyone, but those who give time will see themselves watching one of the most fun series that exist. Dark Angel is criminally ignored, and underestimated, and unfortunately was canceled after only 2 sets. Which was a great shame, since it had the potential to become a great series, although its 42 episodes are only ten years long with the BBC's science fiction comedy Red Dwarf. Since Dark Angel remains unfinished, then search, and if you want more, lobby with Fox to make another series.
