I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent and had a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an X-5 escape, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still "save the world". And be hunted by manticore throughout the season, which gives the series an extra seasoning. <br /> <br /> The second season, though suddenly became a bit strange compared to the first. The plot kind of disappeared, and the series lost some of its charm, mostly because of all the strange "creatures" appearing. Do not misunderstand me, the second season is good, but with a little "manticores". However, they managed to come back to a promising new plot in the final episodes of Season Two, where I had high hopes of seeing more. <br /> <br /> So I really wish they could start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind it, it can not go wrong. So as a conclusion, I'd say it's a great series, but I'm still waiting for a third season!
