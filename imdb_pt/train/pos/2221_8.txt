One night I came across this at the Bravo satellite station. Initially out of curiosity I decided to watch it. To be perfectly honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is gorgeous and her body is shown off well. You would think your talents would be wasted as a hangman, but apparently not after watching the whole movie! My only real complaint is the performance of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays Melnik. Christ is bad! The prison guard Hank is unfortunate as well. All he does is get drunk and make unsuccessful attempts at his co-guard Wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for Hank he gets down and dirty with Wanda near the end. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the plays. This movie is well watching alone for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
