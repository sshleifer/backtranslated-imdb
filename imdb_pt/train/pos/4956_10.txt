This movie is really genuine and random. It's very difficult to find movies like that in many movies now in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought your DVD Tuesday this week and I watched it 4 times. I love the Spanglish accent of Peace, it's very cute as it is. And her and Morgan's acting are so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> The taste of my movie may be quite different from the others, but I have to say that I really love this movie, the simple is the best! <br /> I learned something more about the life of this movie (well, or at least US life) ... life is really random ... Sometimes you know someone, they go through your life and are your friends coincidentally, and you do not spend much time with them, maybe just a little, but you enjoy it while you're with them, and then you and they will never meet again, but the time you are together is truly unforgettable . Just keep those moments in your mind as pleasant and enjoyable memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie may be cheap in the price of manufacture, but its meanings are not cheap. I can rarely learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
