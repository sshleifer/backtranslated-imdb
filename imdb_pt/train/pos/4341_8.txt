Who has no unresolved issues with parents? And which parents have no unresolved issues with each other? <br /> <br /> I know, this sounds heavy. But this is thrown to laughter in the film, improving both comedy and drama. I've always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I'm a bit worried that their stellar qualities might be too big for a small movie, I've been delighted since the first scene. <br /> <br /> Particularly entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about the father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a hard-working, sacrificial father and husband was the perfect balance. Without that scene being so well executed, the film would have seemed much less nuanced, and the character less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
