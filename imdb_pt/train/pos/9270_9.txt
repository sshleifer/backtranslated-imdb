I have to point out, before reading this review, that this is not a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read anything about it, from what you see, I am against politicians in general. ... but if you are wanting to be offended ... I can not help it! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran, because this movie was banned there (see the IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame because the movie is great. It would not be for "Grbavica", this movie would have won the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Precisely because of that (it was the runner-up, or second place, if you want). Because? Because it's a movie about oppression. It's not that it's a complete female issue. It's about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by banishing it, nothing is solved and / or they can make that movie disappear! Another reviewer had a great summary line: "Comedy about a Tragedy," which sums it up nicely!
