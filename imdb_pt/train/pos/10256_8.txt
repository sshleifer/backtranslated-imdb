The first part of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and created as an amateur camcorder tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. He features a woman being kidnapped by a gang of men dressed in black who torture her for several days before finally killing her. The unhappy victim is beaten violently and attacked with raw flesh before having her nails plucked with pliers, her hand crushed with a hammer, her eye pierced with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the most nauseating scene, the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live worms for burns. The series received much publicity when the American actor Charlie Sheen, believing that the series would contain real murders, tried to prohibit its distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the films were just what they seemed to be to most viewers - unhealthy recreations using unpleasant, but obvious, special effects. Staged by acclaimed Japanese comic artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this movie is a sure way to clean up all the less tolerant rooms. But, gorehounds probably will not find anything special.
