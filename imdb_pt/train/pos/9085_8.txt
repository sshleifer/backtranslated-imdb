I see a lot of really negative messages from people who wrote in August, even though the movie was not released in the US until at least the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expatriates living in South Korea and seeing it early. I'm in the US and I only saw this today. I thought the special effects were great, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we're all accustomed to it from many other films. It was not hard to follow. The leaders' performance was weak, but other people were very good. There was humor everywhere as well. I rate it at 8 because I had fun watching, that's what I was.
