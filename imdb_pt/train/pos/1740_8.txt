This film was not much promoted here in Greece, despite having good actors, great script and good photography was not a movie called "blockbuster" in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it is about the difficult time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after being released from a 5 year prison (drugs). The ending is a bit sad ... Mourikis is trying to keep up with the part of him and he handles very well ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange and clear way Hatzisavvas is to once again close to excellence ... 7 of 10 because very few Greek movies can make such an impression!
