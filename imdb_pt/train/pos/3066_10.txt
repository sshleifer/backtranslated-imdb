Everyone is either loving or hating this movie. I go with love. It's so well filmed and so well represented. Beautiful. This film is for people who enjoy well crafted filmmaking. If you are not a fan of well made movies, of course you would hate it. But if you like acting tops, photography, history and development, look no further then here.
