This film reinvents the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, the fat one of the group, exhibits his talents like this generation Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "the king of the $ 1 bet," shows that he is no longer in Kansas consistently raising bets. Kyle's laughter is really infectious, and offers a little eye candy for women too (as does Matt). The dwarves, though they had their moments, did not live up to the Mexican hat dance as it deserves. And finally, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us, stumbling, stumbling, clumsy, pale people who are still looking for someone special. And that hope, is a little place called Cabo San Lucas. Although this blockbuster has just lost the theaters, this is a must-have as we all can relate to one of these Spring Breakumentarions.
