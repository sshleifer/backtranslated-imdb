The Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban piece, where to relate the whole plot would not transmit much. <br /> <br /> Its central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty of the lives of people of all races, backgrounds and seasons. But to proclaim that the subject of the film would horribly underestimate its scope. Likewise, classifying it into a particular genre is futile. <br /> <br /> The film has volumes to say, though probably different volumes for each viewer, and says it all in a non-preacher way from so many angles. that, after all, I can not even define its central message to myself. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a business with that laser precision; every prop, dialog line, and background music bar contributing to your keen and powerful mood message, which I am pleasantly surprised, and leave very thoughtful after each viewing. Still do not feel anything muffled. A scintillating movie with a great cast and everything working.
