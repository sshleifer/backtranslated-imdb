This movie is one that played very well in 1932 and probably would not work so well today, because its style is a bit old-fashioned and artificial. However, if you're the type of person, like me, who loves old Hollywood movies, you cut the movie a little off and you can enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in an infirmary for troublesome pregnancy. In this great room there are about half a dozen beds where the women are waiting to give birth - but the doctors are worried about possible complications (dammit - such a room would really traumatize the mothers!). And, as an episode of "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", each mother has her own special story. With so many extreme and crazy stories, you need to suspend disbelief. I could and really enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the stories: One involves a parent. You do not see the mother, but he's a very, very nervous parent and is included for comic relief. However, it was wonderful here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is sent to the prison hospital - she apparently killed a horrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you assume he was trying to force himself into it! However, she has received a 20-year sentence - and her husband is dedicated to her and is by her side as much as he can. <br /> Glenda Farrell is a horrible person. She has the maternal instinct of a hamster - a very, very bad hamster and an alcoholic! She's very funny and worth seeing for most of the movie. I loved her drinking from a hot water bottle full of gin, and she was annoyed when she discovered that she could not make money by selling her twins !! At the end of the movie, she has a typical Hollywood-style heart-shift that should have been playing - I found it invented. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to a baby who was still born. Surprisingly, afterwards, they put the lady back in the same wing as the women waiting to give birth !!! A crazy woman, whom you assumed has lost a baby for some time, comes down from the psychiatric unit. She insists she's having a baby. Later she escapes again and really takes one of the kids! <br /> <br /> There are more stories than this, but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. Like I said, it's a soap opera and it's a lot of fun - and very sad in the case of several of the stories. The end, in particular, is heart-breaking and exceptionally well done. There were some particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as head nurse. In short, a very good movie - and I have no idea why they felt they had to redo the film just a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
