This is the kind of movie for a late-Sunday snowfall when the rest of the world can go ahead with their own business as you descend into a large armchair and mature for a few hours. Marvelous performances by Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently roam the plot. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty oar through New York life at its best. A film familiar in every way and one that deserves the praise received.
