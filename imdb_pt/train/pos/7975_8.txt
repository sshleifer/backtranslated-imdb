I just love Malle's documentaries. They are so easy and simple, but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. Your love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so great that you can not help but fall in love with them as well. Malle filmed most of it in 1979. He came back 6 years later to see what had changed. This would have been a good movie without the material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It may seem that Malle was only doing what was done in the Up series, but in fact it is not. The Up series is about people. Malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person, but on what happened to that community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan era and farmers are suffering. Once a proud community, now no one sees much future at all and parents expect their children will educate themselves and do something other than farming. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very relevant today. Our financial crises started today because of what was happening back then. Just take a look at those final words from the movie, said by an older lawyer in the city (in 1985): "Well, I have high hopes for this country, because things are going well now only can be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed And a nation does not live much with this obsession And particularly a democracy that ... There is good - there is good - very well in this country and a lot of good people and they do not go - they do not they will stick to that philosophy of greed that is happening now.It is horrible. "Unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a headache hell before that happened.
