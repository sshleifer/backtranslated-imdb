This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling when watching and I have watched twice in a period of 2 days! The film is distinctly unique in its humor and visuals, both are great and similar to the other (more serious) movie treasures of Natali, Cube and Cypher. I have become a big fan of Vincenzo Natali since I watched Cypher and everything he did is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very friendly about this movie are the music characters and "losers" Dave and Andrew, played by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer of the story), actors that I love so much. Also cool are the X-Box Dead or Alive fights (you even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> <br /> All this is a great movie to feel good about. about friendship. You have to see it!
