The movie celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world is preparing for innocent and pure souls and everything has "Happy Ending" as well as the final scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has wonderful soundtrack, mix of Serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is a very refreshing piece of visual poetry. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching is like you 'I was sucked into another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> How Mr. Kusturica's film should be.
