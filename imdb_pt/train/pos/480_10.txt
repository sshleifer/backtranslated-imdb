The main aspect of this film that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a game of chess. So many people have seen this movie and just do not understand it, and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip that flooded me. I'll try to explain this without a spoiler, but be warned, I talk about the things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** possible spoilers **** be forewarned! **** It is a life of "big moves" versus "small moves". He chooses Natalia to be her queen, and he and she behave as their aunt first described the king and the queen and their movements when she introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen carefully to this description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks you a question, it goes back to the past as if it reveals past movements. (By the way, flashbacks are beautifully illuminated.) Flashbacks are also very interesting because they give you not only your point of view as a child but also the point of view of the other. It's impressive. <br /> <br /> Various characters become your helpers or your enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, your actions illuminating you on the side of who they are. Even placing them in a scene is essential to understanding what is happening. Well done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment further on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but hopefully this will illuminate what is really happening in the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on many levels, and that is why the endorsement. It was a delight and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these movies are similar is to use chess and the characters being treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
