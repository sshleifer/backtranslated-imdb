A very good film and a true story. Dan Jansen, the greatest skater of all time. A moving and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens fights cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. From an important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right in believing in his speed skating talent was justified. This image is well worth the time. I wish they would make more movies of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with great actors and a great story. It's a very touching story about beautiful family and faith support for your children and a special dream for your youngest son and his sister.
