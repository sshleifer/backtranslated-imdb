I never thought an old drawing would bring tears to my eyes! When I bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I wanted so much to see Casper's first cartoon entitled The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, There Good Boos To-Night (1948), It made me break ! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox dead! I've never seen anything like it in Casper's other drawings! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing that I just could not watch it again. It's like watching Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me! If I wanted to watch something old and classic, I'd rather watch something happy and funny! But when I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
