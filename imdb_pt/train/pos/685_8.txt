Ghost Story, (The New House) is a fantastic horror story. This is from Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series from the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him since the first family series, Family Affair in the 60's? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as leading actors and main characters in the story. I've seen this recently and I was so scared! If you are alone, I do not recommend that you watch this. This story is great, no words or swearing, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband. Both actors were very good in their parts. If you like ghost stories that are scary, fun and terrifying, then you will like this little gem. I gave it a high rating. I recommend this story.
