This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever taken. John Singleton certainly went the extra mile when he set up this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances from the entire cast, but Epps and Rapaport have become the best and most compelling of any young star's career. <br /> <br /> However, as a college student, many of the issues that Singleton touched were taken. to the extreme. In the sense that, although they are problems faced on many college campuses, they are not presented as large or as open as this movie would make one believe. In some cases, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. However, aside from the fact that it was a little dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to speak, just thinking. One of the things in this photo that I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character, "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see its power." Brilliant, simply brilliant.
