I really love this show! I've always enjoyed the Space Ghost shows of the 90's! This show was hilarious and I can not believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would bring such a funny show off the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives their daily lives with their mom and dad and their best friend who likes to enjoy it very much, Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one in which Zorak got a very good voice and then his voice did not give him any money that Zorak did to sing at all. Another episode I like is the one in which Brak and Zorak did not finish their homework and then came back from Sunday to Friday and they just had fun and then came back to the day the homework was invented and then when they came back for the present homework did not exist! Another episode that I like is the one in which Brak's father and his neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, continue to get into that instrument and then are eaten by a giant worm. Another episode that I liked was one in which Zorak becomes a bully and then a new guy took over his position. I also really like the other episodes! One thing that never ceases to make me laugh is when Zorak is being beaten, blown up and zapped!
