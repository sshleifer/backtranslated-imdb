A little funny movie. It's totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible. But it's funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl he barely knows but who has managed to penetrate his ghosts. Of course it is a denunciation of foolish agreements that you can get on the Internet. You must not believe ten percent of what you are told, and you will never, ever, ever tie your hands in one way or another to anyone or anything or any organization you do not know personally. Most of your "business" will somehow deceive you and attack you. But here the subject deserves to fall victim to such gangsters because he's not just naive, he's absurdly silly. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends with the victim of the corrupt business taking the edge and ending up playing the same game with its victimizer and winning. One thinks it's right too. Security at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I think it is no better anywhere else in the world and even now they have enforced all rules and regulations, it is fun to go through their procedures and systematically frustrate them. So they retaliate by losing their luggage, a real plague at modern airports, and do not expect to get fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or a can opener because it can be dangerous. I can see myself making my way down the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, is not it?
