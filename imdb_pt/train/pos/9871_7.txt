Return To The Lost World was filmed side by side with the 1992 version of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this sequence, the same five people, led by Challenger, return to the plateau where a group began. drilling of oil that threatens to destroy the earth. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to defeat the punches and the plateau is saved, to the delight of the natives. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, the few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T-Rex. and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner reprise their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are back as well. <br /> <br /> Despite reading several negative reviews about it, and those rubber dinosaurs who look cheap, I enjoyed Return to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
