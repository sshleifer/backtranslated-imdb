I saw this photo in 1940 for $ 0.11 and I would like to secure a DVD in 2006 The movie was the greatest adventure of the time and like all epics it's still a marvel of entertainment (B & W and everything) You has a notion of real friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli are excellent (this can not be done today I particularly liked the end where the colonel recites the end of Kipling's poem about Gunga's body "You are a better man than I am Gunga Din" They do not make films of this character today.The only cast member who is still alive today is Joan Fontaine
