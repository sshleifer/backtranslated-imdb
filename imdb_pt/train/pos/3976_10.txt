I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think this reflects the history of drugs very well, and more importantly, it has a strong message for all generations. There are woodstock, there are deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. Completely cover the timeline and evolution of drug use in America, both good and bad. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators, because that is exactly what it is necessary to play on TV these days. I'm waiting for the DVD release. You should definitely see this !!! This movie is awesome - BIG TIME!
