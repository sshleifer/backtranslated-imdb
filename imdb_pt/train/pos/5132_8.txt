Jazz aficionados will cherish this classic short by showing some of the best jazz men just doing their thing. It's like watching a music video without frills nowadays. <br /> <br /> Jazz men give us additional treatment in the person of Marie Bryant, who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I had never heard her sing before, Bryant sounds a lot like Billie Holliday. This is a personal compliment. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is tops as well. With the black cinema of his time fueled by many white stereotypes, this film must be watched and valued. There are no great production values, just a lot of good music.
