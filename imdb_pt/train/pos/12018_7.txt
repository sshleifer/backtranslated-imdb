*** SPOILERS *** Along with hatred and revenge, Zach Provo, James Coburn, has spent the last 11 years in a gang of chains planning his escape. What Provo wants is more than freedom, he equates the man who captured him and in the process, during a wildfire, killed his Navajo wife: Pima County Sheriff Sam Burgade, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Making his escape after killing two prison guards Provo makes his way to Yuma, knowing that it is not only where Burgade lives, but where his young daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey, also resides. Using his fugitive colleagues convicted to lure Burgade into the vast Arizona desert promising them $ 30,000 in gold coins he buried there, Provo plans to demand his bloody revenge at Burgade. But only after you have witnessed your daughter being brutally raped by her doomed colleagues, or is she, for not being with a woman for years, as horny as a rabbit during the mating season! <br /> <br /> Western brutal and very effective updates the 1956 classic of John Wayne's "The Searchers" in a father who scours the dangerous Indian territory by his kidnapped daughter. Charlton Heston as Sam Burgade, guilty of his guilt, somehow responsible for killing Provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing may very well happen to his daughter, Susan is perfect in the role of the aged Sheriff and retired. Charles Coburn as the vengeful half-breed Zach Provo is also in his best form when the obsessed by hatred and murder escaped convicted. The man who escaped with Provo is not really interested in his personal affairs, but has no choice, in that he knows the territory as the back of his hand, but to go along with it. It's just the thought of them doing the same to Susan, when Provo gives them a green light, as well as the $ 30,000.00 buried in gold coins that keep them from separating and going their own way. <br /> <br /> Together with Burgade is Susan's boyfriend, Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, who proves he's as good as Burgade, who thought he simply did not have it, both to track down fugitive criminals and to use common sense, which in this case is missing Burgade in doing so. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** The incredibly brutal and bloody confrontation between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to be solved. Provo, who hates Burgade, limited himself to correct madness and wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death. it was this hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and, after taking half a dozen bullets, ended up putting forever the madman and the bloodthirsty thirsty, as well as the foolish lunatic!
