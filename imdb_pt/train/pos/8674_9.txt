This is a typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is projected, conflict arises and mayhem follows. The characters behave appropriately, the natural tensions between various characters lead to general chaos. The best (and most entertaining) part is when the peace treaty is in place and respected - all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. One word of warning - it's too foolish to let Tom help you carry out your morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended.
