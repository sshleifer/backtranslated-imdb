This movie was a fantastic comedy. There were many starred comedians like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars' wife, as were all stewardesses. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham betrays his job, he becomes Akshay Kumars older and Akshay Kumar gets really jealous because his apartment has to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia begins to like John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, so he finds an apartment and is dating three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
