What I loved about the screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it remained so faithful to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, I think the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. You can tell that the team Stone Angel was careful not to let this happen with this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a super film star. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne), chosen to play Hagar in her youth, also did an incredible job that deserves great praise. I have not seen any of Horne's previous work, but I will definitely look for him after seeing his Stone Angel performance. <br /> <br /> I've heard that the Canadian release of The Stone Angel will happen in the spring or summer. 2008. I can not wait to see it on the big screen again!
