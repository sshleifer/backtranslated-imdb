I read some of the reviews and I'm kind of sad that a lot of the story seems to be covered up. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie and there's so much that can be done in a movie - US or Canada - or anywhere. <br /> <br /> Colm Feore, at least for a recovery. "F @ g-Hag" like me, a great job not only to interpret the gay man as the "friendly neighborhood" but also to be sick. I mean, the man really can not get much paler! However, you may never know of the band near the ... one, end. <br /> <br /> If you need decrepit, there are some movies that you might like. <br /> <br /> Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the drugged brother {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I'll give you credit, he grew up fast and believe me it's good. And, as an aspiring writer, moimeme, I can dig a lot of his ideas and overviews. But I'm more prosaic than poetic. <br /> <br /> I can be easy to please, but I liked it. A beautiful story very well assembled by Canadians, what a surprise. Just toed the 'movie of the week' line, missing it for not being so long, much appreciated. And that was very well portrayed.
