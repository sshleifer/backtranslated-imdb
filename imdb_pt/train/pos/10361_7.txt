Once you've taken your chin off the floor of the perception that they ... somehow ... have managed to get everything together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended, you'll find it's not so bad. The plot is engaging and engaging, and the pace is fast, with it covering many situations, and so often jumping quickly to the next after one or two lines have been spoken. Where this really stands out is the acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also cool to hear both the Australian spoken in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come naturally at least try an accent. Cinematography and editing are good enough, but they do not go beyond the standard. The story of this movie is compelling and the fact of being authentic just makes it even more scary. Although I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is very close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in it. It is sometimes a great court drama. I recommend this to any fan of such. 7/10
