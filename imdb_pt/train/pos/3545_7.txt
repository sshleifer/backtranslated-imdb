Great splashy movie of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to play dice and organize illegal junk games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he gives up craps. He decides one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who bets high, is in town. He bets on Sky that he can not take employee Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. This may sound like a strange plot summary, but the movie is also like this! <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed bag - there are wonderful things here. The songs are good and the dance is incredible. The real show stopper is in the crap game at the end. Also Brando is really very good here - it may seem strange to think of him singing and dancing, but he pulls out. I have to admit that seeing big and bulky Brando taking some tough dance moves was a lot of fun! Also Sinatra is very good and Blaine is simply wonderful as his girlfriend suffered. Their numbers of music and dance are definitive highlights here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she's stuck in a colorless and bland role. The film is too long in 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons really creep and should have been shortened. Also most characters speak very precise English - contractions are never used. Maybe I'm trying to make fun out of the gangsters' mouths, but I found it shocking and it kept throwing me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It pays to get the songs and dances, but the length of the movie comes to you after a while. I give a 7.
