Difficult to imagine that this movie is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so exciting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, very hard to imagine how much effort he made to create this character with disability. Watching it on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is kind of bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normal, her life is also colorful and pleasurable, although we may be aware of the loneliness and painful fetter through her eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor of Christy's success is the support of her mother. which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar for that role, this chubby middle-aged woman uses it to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as the young Christy, what a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very well made, trustworthy. Christy wants love and nothing can derive her the right to love, her passion for the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, the disgusting aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a double-edged sword, happiness and agony are next to each Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN AMERICA, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying, God knows why he chose to direct that crap! Really a career spot for him, what a shame!
