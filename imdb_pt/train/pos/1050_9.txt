This incredible documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of courageous women in the judicial system in Cameroon - police, lawyers and judges. Despite enormous difficulties - lack of means, desperate poverty of the people, multiple languages ​​and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic origin of the complainants and accused - these strong and courageous women are making a difference. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspiring film that restores some of the faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities we see in the film, justice is served thanks to these passionate and hard-working women. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie has a great release in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
