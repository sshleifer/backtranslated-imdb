I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam Wing does not have all that stereotyped melodrama you can imagine when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the course of 17 hours would be just two digits, Gundam Wing goes straight to the point. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is both a political thriller and a series of action. Large parties focus on the diplomatic relations of a war, not just in battles. While battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would be difficult to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the lively use of complex mechanics and fast movements. To my knowledge, this episode of 49 episodes plus a series of films was picked up by the cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally dubbed by them as well. the dubbing is simply flawless. not only are all words combined, but the voices used actually make the characters much more believable. Many believe it's best to watch anime with subs in English, but I just do not have the determination to do that. <br /> <br /> It's not just the good voices, but the track used in the series is quite impressive. I'll just say that you left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what will really attract viewers, and no, you will not like some primetime drama like Lost, which was only made for the purpose of hooking you. explaining the plot would deeply lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until some episodes of the series. The approximate idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty in maintaining the peace. Thus, a war is initiated, leading to military coups and elaborating diplomatic situations. I feel that more detail would begin to give information, which is crucial to the plot. <br /> <br /> I'll finish here by saying that this series is great for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks ALL animes are stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone who wants enter the anime with a serious tone to it.
