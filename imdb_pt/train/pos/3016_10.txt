For those who like their murder mysteries busy, this is definitely the one to see, as it is filled with interesting and suspicious characters, most of them rich types of Long Island socialite. Like the detective, William Powell is alternately starched and inspired, sometimes behaving as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and were pressed together. Mary Astor is very beautiful here. <br /> <br /> Powell made a career playing Philo Vance in a series of films made in some studios over the course of several years. Between these films, he developed a somewhat unusual romantic lead, sometimes even writing gangster roles. Already middle-aged, he was stuck in a career routine by the time he emerged. As with so many talkie stars, it seemed like his time had come and gone, that he was fine for the films of the time of the Law of Prohibition of the Depression, but that with the change of times he was perhaps too mature and dandy to to endure. The Kennel Murder case, directed by the criminally neglected Michael Curtiz, is one of the last of the "old Powells", while the following year would announce the first of the new ones, The Thin Man, whose success would catapult its main actors into the stratosphere of Hollywood. In the Kennel, we can see the films still in a somewhat rigid and ritualized pattern, since the camera does not move much, with the acting, like the presentation, tending to the theater. There is no harm in this approach, however, that has its charms. It gives the film a baroque quality.
