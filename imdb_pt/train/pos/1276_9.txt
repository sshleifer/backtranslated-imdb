I love this movie. The noir images combined with Spillane's nonsense character, Mike Hammer, work wonderfully to create a mood and feel rarely found in low-budget films from the early 1950's. It may not be 'The Maltese Falcon', but this film makes its contribution to gender. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but his "ladies" are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, effectively portrayed by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he knows when investigating the death of an army colleague. When the coin finally falls, your face is a photo. It is good to see that the censorship of the 1950s did not force the filmmakers to omit the famous last line. A low-budget classic in good faith.
