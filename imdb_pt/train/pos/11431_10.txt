My third year French classes have always enjoyed this movie. In a multicultural high school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in French in class, but I know a lot of discussion took place in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée, compared to that between Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I've always mentioned that I felt that this movie had one of the sexiest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. . One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted, "Yes!" when he discovered the scene: the one in which Protée is helping Aimée tie her evening gown, while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use "mirroring technique" when they want to focus on internal conflict by one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is "sexy." <br /> <br /> Most students had difficulty understanding the end of the film. One of them suggested that one theme of the movie was "Africanism," and that no matter how much one loved Africa or Africans, one can not "become" African (as the driver tried to do): one must be an African.
