(Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well told about the farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggles with what Mother Nature plays for them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and tells a family that begins with the marriage arranged from the son to a slave girl. The film does a good job at keeping its interest, despite a performance somewhat impaired by the leadership played by Paul Muni. It is chronic, Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the land where he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main topic of history (beyond the land itself) and, despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, does a good job of showing the country and its people. It's obvious that MGM used their money to create a really good epic with this one at a time when they could probably afford it. The scene with the locusts is extremely well done and the rest of the film really looks good, securing the Best Picture Award at that year's Oscars. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and is very well done.
