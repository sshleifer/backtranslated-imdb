13 days for Glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy for the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this film was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie persuasively, the rest of cast members Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were very old. Raul Julia played General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity because of the professional soldier who, after all, won the battle. The scene in which he rebukes his officers for not being able to mount a guard and prevent a fate is one of the writers did not understand. Failing to watch is a major neglect in the military. Santa Anna was within her prerogatives of being angry. Raul Julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene. Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York might have been reminded that, like Dickinson's from Pennsylvania, they probably did not look very Southern.
