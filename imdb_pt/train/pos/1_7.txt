If you like adult comedy cartoons such as South Park, then this is almost a similar format about the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive candy and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories happening with the school teachers. There's the dumb director, Mr. Bip, the nervous math teacher, and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Gina Yashere of Lenny Henry, Chrissie Watts of EastEnders, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Doon Mackichan of Smack The Pony, Mark Perry of Dead Ringers and Nina Conti of Blunder. I did not know this came from Canada, but it's very good. Very good!
