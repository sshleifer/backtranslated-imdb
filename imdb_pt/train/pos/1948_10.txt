This is a great end to the show. The fact that Mr. Janeway was able to make a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a "poison" that, in essence, wiped out Borg was terrific. The way they finished also left a bit, not much, for a reunion movie. However, they brought "home" and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. Finishing with Tom and B'Lanna taking their baby as soon as they enter the Alpha quadrant. was a great way to show off a fresh start. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some sort - just to see where your characters would be today.
