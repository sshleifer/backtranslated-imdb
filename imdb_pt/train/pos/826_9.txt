I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks! It's true that they are not the best thing that ever happened in Star Wars, but they happened, so deal with it! Also, they are cute, and I do not care if they are marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. Is perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of Luke's entire story on to Anakin. I love how it is revealed in the end - it would be very badly resolved otherwise. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet has been removed, take a moment to think about it. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a man of sick appearance. It is not entirely a machine - it is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director chose such good actors in A New Hope. They all do well. They are believable characters. Hamill does a great job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a good job being a female model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more? <br /> <br /> The music is once again brilliant. It's very touching and meaningful when you can choose character themes in different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke yells "NOOO!" and jumps to fight with his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing less than a genius! What an incredible man! <br /> <br /> Already, the movie has a lot more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can not wait to finally see theaters (CAN WAIT?) and then watch the original trilogy one more time. Bravo!
