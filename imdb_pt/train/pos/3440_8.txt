Love Rosario Dawson, I think she's one of the best actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. It's the consistent tone in everything in the movie. The dialog box is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally soft and on one side. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario's journey from self-control to loss of power and return. <br /> <br /> Including this as a classic rape is not appropriate, and is probably why many people do not like the movie. The standard "rape" audience would not particularly like this movie, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than answers and confronts your target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience, and while the film does not dazzle audiences with its audacity, it draws the viewer to what may or may not be for the wrong reasons. Descent is a good movie that IMHO is severely underestimated.
