There is perhaps a special reason why The Fox and the Child hit a special note in my heart. Having just said goodbye to my new bride - of ... one day - for an unknown period of time, I was a little overwhelmed with various emotions and was suffering from the consequences of putting on the brave face that she needed to see. <br /> I watched some movies and TV shows but my interest went from what I was leaving behind to what is out there and what I have not seen. For this, I have this movie to thank. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and having heard about the movie beforehand, I was sure I would enjoy it anyway. But I did not just like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical field is impressive. How did they do it? How did they capture the animals the way they did? It's simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the tale is good and although the ending is so French and ambiguous, it is happy / sad. Once again, it caught me a little off guard. As a man who normally holds his emotions to himself, the ending was difficult while he was on a plane full of people I would be seeing for the next 15 hours! Maybe it's because the ending made me think about what I left. <br /> <br /> But for those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And it's life. Of course, there are those things that you love and feel comfortable around ... but the outdoors contains many a mystery. So next time I see something out of the ordinary while I'm out in the open; I will explore it, observe it, and embrace it. This is precisely what happens in this film and that is precisely what you should do with this good film / nature documentary as well. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Q. It's two months after the plane trip. We still do not know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
