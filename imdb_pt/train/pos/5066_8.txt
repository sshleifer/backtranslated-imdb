I know some people think the movie is boring, but I disagree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and I think letting parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity. I do not think the purpose of a good biography is the detailing of one's life, but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more fascinating than successfully reinventing yourself? "Men become what they dream - you dreamed well." Good work for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more movies.
