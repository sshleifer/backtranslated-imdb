This movie has it all. It is a classic representation of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of thousands to have the chance to choose his destiny in America. This cinematic, but extremely accurate representation of the Miamis Drug Empire is astounding. Brian DePalma does an incredible job directing this image, so much so that the viewer gets involved with the plot as well as with all the characters in the cast. With the pressure of Tony's characters being so believable and strong, Brian DePalma takes away the talent exposed by Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's sister), Robert Loggia ) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and still watch weekly. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, I am a believer that in another 20 years people still refer to this movie in astounding numbers. With other crime films being so dramatic, this movie is a shock to the system.
