It took me a long time to find the title in a special video library in Berlin and was lucky enough to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think it's one of the best horrormovies of all time. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie black comedy. I must admit, I could not laugh when I first saw it (and it was the same with the second time!) On the one hand Trelkovski looks so cool and even cute in his shy behavior, but on the other hand, he hits that boy on the playground and there is no explanation for this. But the strangest thing is, of course, his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most terrifying in this movie. Of course everything is on your mind, but it is this plan that brings that feminine side of him or was it also before he moved - I think it's an interesting question. Their schizophrenic behavior is hard to understand and it is horrible to see their two sides or identities struggling against each other. The result is that he cuts his hand first and then leaps out of the window. But this terrible cry - does it mean that everyone will repeat again and again and again ... that your soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphics and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - this is not an incident, but a clue from my point of view.
