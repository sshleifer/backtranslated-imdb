If you advance fast through the horrible corner, you'll find a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good on paper. His trademark acting style works well for the crafty Puss in Boots. The other actors are good for their parts. I did not find any of the performances terribly fake or clumsy. The king, in particular, looks like a real ass, and I wonder if he should be. I can not remember the original tale. Special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer-generated products we see today. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to kids and adults who are a kid at heart.
