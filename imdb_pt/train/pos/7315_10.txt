Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that spawned a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> Apparently unstoppable killer escapes from the mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to chase a local nanny on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that never fails to have its reputation as a horror masterpiece! The frightening story and intelligent direction of Carpenter give this film a life so good and cold that it must be seen to be truly felt! The direction usually consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, goring doors, which makes even the everyday scenery of a neighborhood of really scary towns. Carpenter well-times their suspense and their shaking shocks to make them more effectively amazing, which in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever achieve! In addition, he is wise enough to give us some really lovely young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension even stronger. High praise also goes for Carpenter's simple but scary and annoying soundtrack. In a sense, Halloween is a good example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. The young Jamie Lee Curtis plays a great role as the lovely nanny Laurie Strode, she is so good that she would perform in several other horror films before getting into bigger movies. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as Myer's doctor, who is desperate to capture him again. Loomis, Soles, Castle, among others, are also good. <br /> <br /> Just like your own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never ceases to be thrilling and relaxed. It is a must for all fans of genre! out of ****
