This is a great movie for all Generation X'ers. What a different world America of 1972 was compared to our psychotic twenty-first century. You can have a sense of what a 1972 America spent was like watching this movie. I discovered that the clothes and the styles of the car brought back to me fond memories of a country much better than what we have now. Just think ... back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Rage Road, 911, bird flu, snipers, etc., etc. The Vietnam war ended. There will still be seven years before Star Wars leaves. The personal computer and the internet would still be 29 years away. <br /> <br /> When this film was first released, the producers had to market the film like no other company wanted. So he started visiting small Protestant churches across the country being shown on movie projectors (this was before the VCRS, of course). The pastor of a church who would be interested in showing A Thief in the Night to his congregation would get a copy of the film. So he would arrange a night to show it in the church meeting area or in the cafeteria. Members of the congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family and would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can surpass the limited production values ​​of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value, then I think you will like the movie more. Of course I'm talking like a gener. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century pit we have now.
