Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic, but so much fun. Lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who would become Oscar-winning actors, deliver incredible performances. Voight as Texas swindler Joe Buck, who moves from the small town of Texas to New York City to become a con man. He does not apologize for his chosen profession, but it's not that easy. New York City women, like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass, played by Oscar-nominated Sylvia Miles, are different from the Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died in 1969 of cancer. The venues in New York are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman's characters and Buck evolve into a man who moves the male friendship. The men are struggling to survive the life of New York City by not playing by the rules like getting a real job. As the film evolves, Buck's past comes to the surface and is haunted, but not clear. The movie is not for kids, but compared to today's movies and television shows, Midnight Cowboy may be quieter. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party you can not forget. It's also a tear-rip movie, so take off your handkerchiefs as well.
