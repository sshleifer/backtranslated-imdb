This movie is amazing and I would recommend it for kids and adults alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; much better than anything American studios were producing at the time. However, there are some caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the previous Studio Ghibli catalog and then started to slaughter it. My main point is that Disney re-dubbed the film, although the original English version was very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took much of the characters' attractiveness, and. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to tearful teens. The original score is also much better than the Disney remix. That raises the question: why did Disney make these changes? It seems to me that, having Van Der Beek and others being chosen, Disney can attract more money, which is fair, but in the process they tarnished the film. It's still a beautiful movie and I would still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney ruined a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I'm lucky to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub I'm now going to save with my life!
