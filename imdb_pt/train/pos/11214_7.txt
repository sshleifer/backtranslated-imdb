This was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think at a $ 2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd. , so I have no reference to the first installment made by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by McNairy County's corrupt system and the brutality of "country gangs." I was also amazed at the fact that a man decided he would not let go, and went out to do something about it. Courageous ? I thought so - to a point where I felt shivers down my spine. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story about the American courage to get up and do something about a system that serves only your own interest. I was very impressed with this, and I think this is still one of the best films of the hero / antihero genre, which may be a laugh, but it includes recent movies like "The Punisher", but more so because it's a true story. The recent remake starring "Rock" simply does not do justice to the real fire in Buford Pusser's story. <br /> <br /> A "classic" that I'm sure will resurface again in the future.
