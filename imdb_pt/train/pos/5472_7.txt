Barbara Stanwyck as a real tough cookie, a waitress for the working classes (and prostitute in the hands of her father) who escapes to New York and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job, moving to Mortgage and Escrow, and later as second assistant secretary in the bank. The dramatic study of a female character without fear of being inconvenient has lost nothing of her power over the years, with Barbara acting like a storm (portraying a woman learning to be a front-line actress). Practicing a small Nietzschean philosophy in her messy life, this lady ends the feeling, but she never loses our fascination, our admiration. She has a broad and hard mouth, but she is not a bitch, nor a devourer of men or women. This girl is all to herself, and while we hope she eventually learns about the real values ​​of life, her journey up and down the ladder of success provides heated and sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and lots of eye makeup) does well in an early role as an assistant in the archives office, although all supporting players are very good. *** in ****
