Only the name of this movie made me want to see exactly what it was, so I recorded this movie during the wee hours of the morning. If you ever wanted to see what the miners had to go through during the early days and really see a dramatic scene when the mine collapses into the men. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to the aid of the French miners to the incredulity of the French citizens. The actors were all excellent, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small boy who worked in the mine. There is an old retired miner who can get down the mine by stairs when the elevator breaks. If you are a true fan of movies, this is a movie you will not want to miss.
