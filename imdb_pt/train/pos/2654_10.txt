Everyone should see this movie completely! It's scary, but do not resort to the lame "jump-off-on-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-off-as-scary" stuff. That's great. See this incredible amazing movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Each of his films are masterpieces, including this one. The Illuminated is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as janitors of the winters, and goes into the snow. Well, the house is haunted. The boy is psychic. The husband is easily impacted by haunted hotels and ... well ... HILARIDADE ENSUA !!!! Not really. It becomes this thrilling thriller where things are thrown to the viewer from all different directions, and it gets scary. Not just the classic "Here's Johnny" scene. It is memorable, but it can not speak for the entire movie. It's one of those things where words do not adequately explain, and you just need to see. Then go on Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
