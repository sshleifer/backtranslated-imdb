I read most of the reviews on this movie. I saw this movie (and the whole series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, we all liked and it made us meditate on what we already knew as we read and study the Bible about the rapture and the end times . No one was scared or traumatized as I read in some posts. The film is based only on biblical facts. I have seen many end time films "Tribulation", "Armageddon" and so on and by far this is one of the best in presenting biblical truths. It may not have many special effects like today's movies, but I think it's a good witnessing tool. This movie and its series of prophecies can be viewed for free at this site, and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.
