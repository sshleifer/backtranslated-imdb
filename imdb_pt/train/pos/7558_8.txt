This episode of the first season goes a little to controversy with all the angle of gender bending. I imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before it ended to appease the censors. The story itself is original and well written and the direction is complemented by the excellent acting (Nicholas Lea makes his debut in the X-Files but not as Agent Krycek but as a victim named Michael) I liked it especially development and the end itself. <br /> It is different, but nice. Ignore any bad comments you may hear. Watch you and make the judgment then
