I do not know why people always want deeper meaning in the movies, or they find them useless. <br /> <br /> How about being entertained? Something Morgan Freeman stands out for. He has the chance to show off a little. His cast colleague Paz Vega gains a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to entice people to watch the film. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some ducks, some bittersweet, but nothing on top. I got a special kick from Jim Parsons as a contractor for a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says, "You make me want to be a woman." He's just hilarious. The fight scene between Mrs. Vega and her ex-husband and his girlfriend is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a cute and charming movie that will make you smile. You could do much, much worse.
