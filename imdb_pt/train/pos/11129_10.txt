I did not think so, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was gay porn. At that moment, all I knew was the reference to him in that episode of "Seinfeld" with Jerry trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer all sick and with a nosebleed. <br /> <br /> The film was great, and surprisingly optimistic and not all pessimistic pessimistic pessimist like some movies that I can not even remember because they are all crap. <br /> <br /> The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck going to New York trying to be a prostitute (basically a male prostitute), thinking they would be easy choices, only to hit hard on the wall bricks when a woman ends up hurrying her, accusing him of his sexual encounter. <br /> <br /> So he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "Ratso" by all and the cute gays who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a scoundrel but kind (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the film is so sweet and exciting to see them more friendly and such and such. Rizzo reveals himself to be a sad and pitiful man who is very sick and very depressed and self-conscious, hates being called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems solved, and he will learn to be a cook and be famous there. <br /> <br /> It's comforting to see Joe do everything he does to get them to Florida, along with many hilarious moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party, and getting caught by the woman who says "Wow. you do not have to steal it. "And he says" Well, if you're free, then I will not steal "and that completely improvised and unscheduled classic moment where Hoffman is almost hit by that And the acting is so believable, you would never believe that Joe Buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would grow to be the " legendary and beloved Dustin. Hoffman It's not the first time they work together on leading roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sad part that I believe to be an exaggeration to say that it is "depressing." Ratso Rizzo is crumbling all through the movie, barely able to walk, barely eats, coughs too much, is sick and hits a head of the bus on the way to Florida. It hurts a lot, and just miles from Miami, he finally dies on the bus. The bus driver assures everyone that nothing is wrong, and continues. Sad, but not the way it would make you go home and cry and be sad as if you had just lost your 13-year-old dog. <br /> <br /> All right, great movie. And the soundtrack basically consists of "Everybody's Talking", played throughout the film at appropriate times. A strange but great movement, since the music is good and fits perfectly in the tone of the film. Go and see, it's great, go buy
