I saw this movie for the first time while I was drunk at a motel in Canada. While leafing through channels, I found the Easy Lube part. My friend continued to leaf, but I told him to go back. Something about the easy lubricant name just did not seem right. I watched the rest of the movie was very funny. He wrote down some of the credits and came home to look. It turned out to be the first Chevy Chase movie. I did not remember him in him. I do not remember much about it, so I rented it and took a second veiw. It's very funny and quite graphic. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, except not so funny. Love the fingers, easy lubricant, and I'm president's fame. The skit of the dealers is also very cool. I give a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
