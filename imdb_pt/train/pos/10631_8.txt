This film was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation for us. We really thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple who ever got married and had kids. Obviously we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect and may not want to. But we both choose this love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, this has never changed our sexual orientation. That sort of thing is for the crazy Christians. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had cases, but never with the opposite sex. As we get older, we no longer have extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not improbable. However, the suggestion that they have become heterosexual seems quite unrealistic to me. My wife and I have slept together for the last 40 years. We're still gay. History end.
