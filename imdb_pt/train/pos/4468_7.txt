Two sailors are on leave - the ladies' man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and the innocent shy Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and they both fall in love with her. There's more, but you've probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so good and healthy - it gets annoying really fast. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and that's too much for such a silly story. There are also some annoying numbers of Jos√© Iturbi and his orchestra. Still, it's worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing, this becomes magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you would not mind. It is filmed in Technicolor rich with all the brilliance that MGM had. The acting is OK - Kelly is fine (though seeing him as a girl man is pushing him) and Sinatra is great (though seeing him as a shy guy was pushing that too!). Grayson has nothing to do but she is incredibly beautiful to behold. Some pictures of her literally took my breath away! There are many highlights here: Sinatra and the large number of Kelly's dancing and singing; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and the famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom plays a special role as well. There is also the little Dean Stockwell who steals all the scenes in which he is. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot does not hold up, but it's still worth telling. This was a huge hit in his day.
