Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is heading towards political confrontation again. That is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish secondary schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. The American pilot who engages in the Spanish Civil War chooses the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes Uribe ever made. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (could anyone tell me the difference between Any war and a civil war?) It is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Cowards who start their abuse of power even for innocent children are now active again. A film like 'Carol's Journey' / 'Carol's Journey' tells one of the many sad stories of the twentieth century. It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Once again excellent work from the Iberian Peninsula!
