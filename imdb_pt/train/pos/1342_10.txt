A fascinating and wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he speaks are easy to relate to his works, particularly the earlier ones, the age of silence. Very nice, despite being a bit long, I thought this would be one of the best documentaries in the cinema. Preview needed if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
