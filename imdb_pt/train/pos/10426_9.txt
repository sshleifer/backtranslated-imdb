I like that because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters of the company did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they had fun, that is, what they were. The film did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about your values ​​of life. Many movies are so in terms of discussing the definitions of life or love or current relationships or problems in life or some kind of them. Before Sunrise handle it in a nice way, which makes the viewer stop, think and adjust the breath and continue watching the movie. Before Sunrise, I did not try to instill a specific thought in your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues of daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or fluent idiot ideas. You would still be thinking about these issues by yourself and curious about the next line in the story. The end was not very important, after all. You can take something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be nice. This is a nice film and it's worth your time to watch it. I'm on a journey too. The movie somehow represented a part of me and answered some of my questions.
