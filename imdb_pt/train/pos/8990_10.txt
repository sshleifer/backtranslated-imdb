The film is about Anton Newcombe. The music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop. It is only fair that Newcombe has the last word on the film, which in this text you can find in the "news" section of the site brianjonestownmassacre. I would have a link here, but the IMDb would not allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentarists are limited by what the camera captures, as well as by the need to put together a cohesive narrative from the somewhat random occasions when chance placed the camera lens on a line of sight with relevant chance . In Dig !, Fortune smiled at the Dandy Warhols, capturing their rise to pop idol status as they formed sweet pop confectionery for mass consumption, most notably "Bohemian Like You," a song that turned them into global darlings. thanks to a Euro cell phone ad. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck for the Brian Jonestown massacre. The film captures little of what made the original BJM great, with the sole exception of a single montage that lasted for about a minute, showing Newcombe creating / recording a series of brief instrumental parts, not noteworthy in themselves, and concluding the sequence with a reproduction of the exuberant and shimmering sounds that must have been in Newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the film; one of the filmmakers and two of the band members (the BJM track consists only of former members and without Newcombe). Both Warhols and BJM students point to this set-up sequence as the "best" part of the film, and I agree that, given the film's focus on Anton Newcombe, it's the only part of the film that sheds light on his film. present, and seems too brief to give a proper balance to this portrait attempt of the "tortured artist." <br /> <br /> Interesting thing about the comments is that unlike the movie, they are recorded in real time - a long time - which can be more honestly revealing than a documentary that takes shape mainly through editing. <br /> <br /> Dandies do not do well in their comments. If the world of rock and roll expands the experience of high school life for its inhabitants - as I believe it does - the Dandies are the preppy types obsessed by popularity, those who listen to rock because that's what their peers do, while the A BJM's crew comes out as the half-rejected outsiders, half self-exiled (for insiders like the Dandies, "losers") who are the true spirit of rock. Joel Gion of BJM, who talks a lot, preaches the message of the film to me when he says (paraphrasing): "You can not forget that Anton was able to do the only thing he said he wanted to do. Make a lot of good music . "<br /> <br /> The Dandies, meanwhile, laugh easily at every outrageous display in the course of Newcombe's collapse (all BJM filming ended in 1997, before Newcombe dropped heroin). Courtney Taylor-Taylor's discount for Newcombe's commitment to her vision is summarized as follows: "He's 37 and still lives in his car.You can download all his work on his site.He was so tired of being fooled for all the others giving it all away. He could be making a mint. " You can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the film can not be attributed to filmmakers; on the contrary, it is the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of cooperation on the part of the film that makes this picture of Newcombe so fragmented. But it's probably the best we'll get, out of your music. <br /> <br /> I only rented disk 1, which has the feature. Most of the extras are on disk two. Not renting this, as I put it in my order to buy the handset.
