Well, maybe not just before Rodney King's riots, but even a few months earlier it was timely enough. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know, the police were acquitted and LA was burned to the ground. It just shows the state of race relations in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African American Simon (Danny Glover) becoming friends after Simon saves Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, the film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that free violence is very cool ... until he gets shot. There is also a bit of existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize they are not living what they really want. <br /> <br /> It seems that "Crash" has somewhat renewed people's interest in race relations, but it came out much earlier. Maybe we can never have stable race relations in this country. But anyway, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. Kevin Kline states as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
