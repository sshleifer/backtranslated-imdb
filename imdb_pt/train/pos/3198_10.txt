That's how I felt when watching this movie. I loved. It was hilarious. But I felt as if I was having a sneaky view of someone's psyche and then laughing as I squirmed to create an interesting point. A friend puts it this way: "I feel like we've invaded someone's home and now we're watching their awful home videos without their knowledge." <br /> <br /> Another one of these facts is stranger than pieces of film fiction. "Groovin 'Gary," the original "Beaver Kid," is a small-town guy who pops up on a nearby TV station, hoping to get into the movie - and he certainly does, though perhaps not as he initially hoped. With high hopes for fame and meaning, he invites Harris to come and film a true talent mission he has organized in his hometown - spearheaded by his own dragging act "Olivia Newton-Don." <br /> <br /> The director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slow-moving story. Some images of a clumsy boy who wants to be someone becomes, in two subsequent reinterpretations, the story of the freedom of repressed sexual identity in the small American city. Harris simultaneously criticizes the attitudes of the small American city, celebrity cult, and exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover perform stunning performances. the young Sean Penn is most evocative - he closely follows the actual "Gary" images, but with strong nuances given to push the direction of the interaction the way Harris wants him to go. <br /> <br /> The end of the wide eyed naivety the original Gary is what moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A movie not to be missed. I did not see anything like that. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
