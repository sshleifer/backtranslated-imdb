The group of people are traveling to Belgrade on a horrible bus driven by a drunken driver and his mute son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). His journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events which, with much irony, describe the fall of the nation's spirit in 1941 and are so funny that to this day they are used as ordinary jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a 4-foot-tall peasant with his 4 children who are almost twice as big as him. In the end, the film takes a dramatic turn and the journey is nothing but a swan song from a dying country.
