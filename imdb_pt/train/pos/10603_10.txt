I get tired of my daughters of four and five being constantly subject to watch Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. Everything seems to be the same tired old cartoons rewritten over and over again. When my daughters could not come to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just relax and rest for a while. I turned on the TV and looked for something different, turned the channels. My finger stopped surfing the canal the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I love every single thing this man did and when I saw that he was doing a dubbing job for a duckling ... well, I could not change channels! My daughters were instantly hypnotized by the cartoon, and the more we watched the show together, the more I grew up and loved him along with the message being portrayed. It is not necessarily an advocate of "gay rights," but of anyone who has ever been marginalized as a child by ANYTHING. I had friends who were chosen by one or the other .... Too fat, too skinny, too feminine, being a bully, not being smart enough, having only one parent ... you name it! Kids, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see a fun drawing that actually passed on a MESSAGE OF LIFE to your audience. My girls already accept others as they are and do not choose others for being different. My eldest daughter really defends her friends if they are chosen (one of them happens to a single mother and that little girl is chosen often - it warms my heart when Kassie defends her!). So those of you who are condemning this program because you think you are a proponent of "gay rights" or are being forced to "accept certain visions," you have clearly and completely lost the point of this small and poignant cartoon. <br /> <br /> And if you need to explain to him .... well, you need more help than any television show could offer.
