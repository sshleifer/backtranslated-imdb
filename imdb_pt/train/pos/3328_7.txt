It is rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the film (eg Big Fat Greek wedding myself, myself and Irene). There were only a few needlessly insane jokes in this film, nothing intractable profane. All around, it was a cute movie with friendly characters. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt. It looks like they should have finished in the world series for a real final blow. The performance left a bit to be desired, but was compensated by the pace of the story. If I'd known it was a Farrelly brothers movie, I would have assumed it was trash upset stomach and did not watch it, but it looks like even they are able to make a movie right by accident. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads out all the time and start making good movies.
