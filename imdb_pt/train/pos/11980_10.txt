Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and it is also a good family program. There really are not any more shows like this. The kids are very cute and despite being a little tacky, it's still good, especially for those who watched it as a child. I'd love to see the cast interviewed now. Anyone who would like to see cast interviews, kind of a place where they now type thing for the special features of the DVD, should go to Petition spot site and sign a petition entitled Full House Reunion on DVD as there is a petition for this in hope of which the cast may want to do so. Yay for Full House!
