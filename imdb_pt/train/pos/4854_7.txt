Curl up with this on a dark and stormy night and get ready to be alternately amused, angry and scared. The old story about a ghost train that is said to traverse the solitary English landscape in the dead of night may be implausible, but it is a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like "THE ACCIDENT", which locals may remember but will not talk about. But mostly the film is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to show his particular brand of humor in vaudeville style among the scary parts. The tacky humor of Askey is not very fashionable these days, but if you just let it wash you can be fun. This is probably the best of the Askey movies.
