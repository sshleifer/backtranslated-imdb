When I rented the Domino, I was expected to be very dumb. I hate movies that have really eye-catching editing and cinematography, and Domino also has very bad reviews. The only reason I watched it is because I enjoyed Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also just like stories based on adventures. Yes, editing and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this movie for some bizarre reason. Domino was very, very fun and often very funny. It was terribly underestimated when it was released, I think, because everyone wanted another emotional journey like Scotts in the latest Man on Fire movie, and instead has just wonderful entertainment. I really understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I love it and recommend it.
