In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous city of speed trap. Much revenue was generated by the Sheriff's Department, which picked up speeders. Those who tried to run away from the sheriff? Well, that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the Clarksberg curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the movie, a couple of license soldiers trying to get back to base in time is pushed to death, if I remember correctly. Then one day a stranger entered the city. Possibly the hottest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord's gaskets. In possibly the last hot rod. A 35 'black Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and the fire of hell. He gets caught up in speeding by the sheriff on purpose. It checks the earth's configuration. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way to get justice for your brother's death and fix things up so that "this will never happen to anyone again": recreate the chase and solve the hot-rodder style of competition to the death. He goes out to the Turn and practices. The sheriff knows McCord knows. The race starts ... This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who has ever tried to master the maneuvers on a particular stretch of road.
