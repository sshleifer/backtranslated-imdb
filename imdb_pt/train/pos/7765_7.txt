Douglas Sirk addresses this exaggerated drama about the unhappy afflicted. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different visions of life. Kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. They both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it's Kyle who has the means to impress her and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the city's nymphomaniac and carrying a torch to Mitch, who always seems to be the one to clean up Hadley's mess. Ambitious with pretension; a little above the top, but the stars make a movie to see. I was very impressed with Malone. Completing the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
