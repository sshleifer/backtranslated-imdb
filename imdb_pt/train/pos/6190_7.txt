Fay Grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I have not seen the previous movie, and I do not know if this is good or not. I can only consider the current film on its own merits. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's film-making style is something you like or dislike. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry and ironic humor really resonates in me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has a well written intelligent parody air that I had and many in the audience at the Melbourne International Film Festival laughing loudly. For the first half of the movie, it was relentless and delivered with impassive frankness. It's a humor style that unfortunately lacks in theaters and a welcome relief to the irrational teen comedies that Hollywood pumps like pancakes. <br /> <br /> During the second half of the movie, the mood begins to decrease as the movie transforms. in an international espionage / conspiracy thriller. If this was Hartley's intention or if he ran out of ideas, it is unclear, but I think a little editing or rewriting to cut fifteen minutes of the film would have maintained the original impetus of the film. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had more time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery, and Elina LÃ¶wensohn played all good supporting roles. The visuals of the film were good (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also of Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I enjoyed it immensely. If you like Hartley's previous work, you'll probably enjoy it.
