"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing sci-fi films of the 1970s and still very persuasive by today's standards. Although flawed and somewhat dated, the apocalyptic touch and environmental premise (typical for the time) still seem very disturbing and thought-provoking. The quality level of this film surpasses most contemporary SF films because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider to be classic. New York in 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with overpopulation, unemployment, an unhealthy climate, and the total shortage of all vital food products. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston plays a cop who is investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he is faced with scandals and obscure secrets ... The script is a little too sentimental at times and the climax does not really come As a big surprise, the atmosphere is still very tense and strange. The sequence of riots is truly tiresome and easily one of the most macabre moments in the 1970s cinema. Edward G. Robinson is finally impressive in his last role and there is a large (but modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood" , "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is science fiction in my book: A Nightmare and Inevitable Fades for Mankind! There are no extravagant spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
