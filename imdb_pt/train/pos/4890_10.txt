Excellent cast, more please! <br /> <br /> If you can get just about anything else written by Plater (or starring these wonderful actors). For those who do not know Plater has a real jazz sensation, my recommendation is to see the 'Beiderbecke' trilogy whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does the song start?'"
