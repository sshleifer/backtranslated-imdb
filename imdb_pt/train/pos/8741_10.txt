"The life of an insect" is like a favorite candy bar - it's filled with big bits that add up to something really tasty. <br /> <br /> The story could not have been better; is smart, has "heart" (emotion) and each character has a nice "bow" (a growth or change). In comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" who have a "bow" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment with Buzz. There are lots of laughs and cute moments in "A Bug's Life". All actors turn into excellent voice work, and the excitement, both movement and detail, is superb. <br /> <br /> This serious movie fan does not play around "10" s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the "10" I gave.
