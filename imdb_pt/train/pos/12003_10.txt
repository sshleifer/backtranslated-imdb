As a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as possible from the history of my new religion. I was invited to attend a screening of this film with my children and the other young men and women as well as their families from our ward. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring night, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio, to the historic church village located there. We should have had reservations at the Vistor Center to see this movie. As the preview of my film was limited to just a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only "feature films" I had seen in the church were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. In the beginning, the film The missionary interpreter distributed handkerchiefs saying that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this film. I thought "Ok ... but it takes a lot to get me to tears". Imagine my surprise when I saw myself crying! It is indeed a very touching and inspiring testament of the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Look and believe in your powerful message!
