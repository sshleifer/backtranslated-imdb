Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" are that the wacky leporid in "A Wild Hare" now has a name, and he utters his famous "Of course you realize this means war!" for the first time. For the most part, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out exactly what to do with this long-eared rogue. It's certainly a must-have for hardcore fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake, it's very hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible. Elmer Fudd. Light shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon. I recommend.
