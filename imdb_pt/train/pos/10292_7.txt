Let me start by saying that I'm a big Carrey fan. Although I admit I have not seen all your movies * cough * the magestic * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleasant. None of the other comments really went into how cheesy gets in the end, I do not know what the writers were thinking. Somehow, I could not help but feel that this movie was a frustrated attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Steve Correl from The Daily Show is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast. See Bruce Almighty if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see a comedy of mild humor (that soft piano music).
