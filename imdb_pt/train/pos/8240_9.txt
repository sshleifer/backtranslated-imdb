I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This movie was kind of comforting when I thought I would not be able to come in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally surprised. When I got to the theater, I could not remember anything but the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was in it). Great performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true retreat from her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I do not think since Chaplin played such a brilliantly unlined actor that they never existed. The kids were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, I could see my first choice anyway - and that was much better.
