Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this "modern" musical that shows the comic skills of MacDonald. Surreal 40s musical seems to be making fun of the 40's fashion even when they were in current fashion. Fantasies and creepy scenes (yes, B & W) increase the surreal and dreamlike quality of the entire film. Several good songs animate the film, with the number "Twinkle in Your Eye" a total highlight, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the huge cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also seen in extended parts are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Ottiano Rafaela, Myrtile Odette, Cecil Cunningham and many others. Very fun and good to see the wonderful MacDonald in his jitterbug / vamp routines. She could do anything.
