Andy Goldsworthy is a first-rate Taoist master, expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. In fact, time and change are what your job is fundamentally about. I bought her first book several years ago and my family has often wondered. So it was a pleasure to meet the artist personally through this film, he is as patient and kind as you would expect, and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of them are expressed in his occasional inability. to say it in words. He is like most children who play alone outdoors (if they do it more), creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before overcoming them. Mr. Goldsworthy has been given the gift and mission to extend this kind of play to create deep views of nature and to open our tired eyes to it in new and brilliant ways. And always with the greatest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and imaginative monk.
