This movie should not be compared to "The Sting", or other caper / assed / con films. What makes a movie experience so good is what it has to say about relationships, fraud and trust. It is also a rather cutting criticism of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a psychiatrist who is so easily deceived and acts so primitively in the end. Has Mr. Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly recommended!
