I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (it's spelled right?) In Cybil. I have not seen her for some time, and I forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job at it. The support cast was also very good. At some angles, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The raptor was pretty scary and the story usually had some good twists. The young boyfriend was hot. I thought her husband definitely had something to do with it for sure. <br /> <br /> I just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. I kept my interest and will watch again when they reexecute. Can anyone else recommend movies similar to this? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you want. Thanks in advance.
