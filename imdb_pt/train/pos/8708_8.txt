I watched it subtitled as it was in Russian, but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived all his life unhappy because he was different and because anger led him to do mortal things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him, ending a deadly battle. There was a good amount of blood, but not much for the weak. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the old Hollywood movie, but for those who like independent films. I kind of have the feel of an Asian fantasy movie.
