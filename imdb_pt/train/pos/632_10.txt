OK here's how I do it. I sort movies in 10 components. Each component will start inherently with 5 points. You can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible value of 10 or 0. Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Thriller - I give this component 10 points. He had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed a lot and for a long time throughout the film and yet I was captivated by the fantastic drama and the suspense. <br /> <br /> Batch - I give 10 points to this component. I thought all good fairy tales had already been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, I returned to my childhood and, at that moment, I once again believed in unicorns, evil witches and shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Film Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the film captured the story very well on most angles, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what happened off camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. with moderation. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and that had it all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. Without names and experienced actors, the cast was incredible! Michelle Pfeiffer was marvelously evil, Charlie Cox made Tristan come alive, Claire Danes gave excitement to the stars, and I will never look again and Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Act - I give this component 10 points. Even the novice actors threw their scrolls to perfection. Again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again. <br /> <br /> Character Development - I give this component 9 points. This seemed a bit rushed and I think if the film had been a little longer, they could have made the characters a little better justice. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. Was the dialogue clever, witty, fun? even the porridge had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire film. I'm not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finalizing - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect end! I feel that certain aspects of the final should have been more pronounced, while others might have been more subdued, but no strings were left untied. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! See in the Theater? Most definitely! Bottom line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing you at the theater, I know I will be back for seconds!
