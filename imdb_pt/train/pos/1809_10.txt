All dogs go to heaven is the most beautiful film to have dogs in 1989. Don Bluth's previous film, The Land Before Time (1988), became a hit. Dogs are as cute as little mice. Aw, I just want to hug them when they're beautiful. Where I was? Oh yes. Its animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are played to perfection and the songs are cute and touching. It opened on November 17, 1989 the same date as the little mermaid produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so bad because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on Him! Love Surviving The Song Performed By Irene Cara And Freddie Jackson Was So Beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film of all time.
