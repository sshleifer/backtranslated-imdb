This film is well done on so many levels that I am amazed that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) until the time of this publication). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic storyline, a complex interplay between characters and mind-bending battles - they need to be seen to be credited! The only complaint I have is the subtitles in the DVD version of HK that I got (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just do not understand when I read and hear from various sources: "it has a messy plot ...", "I could not follow the story ...." or "Characters came from nowhere .. . ". From the first time I watched this movie, I understood it, I followed it, I knew why the characters were there and I loved it! I've watched about 8 times and each time is pure pleasure. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I've shown this movie to many American colleagues (people who have never seen a HK movie before) who feel the same way. None of them stopped following the plot and each person declared their love for this film. Oh man, why can not we have such things coming out of Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a beautiful marriage of special effects, character development and plot. <br /> <br /> This is also not coming from a novice lover of Asian movies. I own an extensive library of Asian movies and I must say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you watch, you will be amazed by the incredible special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn to this fantasy world and you will not want to leave! I have seen both the 1983 and 2001 versions (both made by Tsui Hark), and the 2001 version is much better compared to IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to the subtitles, I have one additional complaint about this movie: I did not want it to end ... I'm begging you Mr. Hark - can we have a sequel?
