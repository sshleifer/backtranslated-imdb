I saw this movie at the 18th film festival in Haifa, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Seeing it on a big screen (and I mean GREAT, not one of those TV screens that most cinemas have) with an excellent sound system always enhances the cinematic experience as the film takes your eyes and ears and sucks you in history, in the image. <br /> <br /> The film features a set of characters, who are freely intertwined. Their stories intersect at certain points, and the multiplicity of stories reminded me so much of the great Robert Altman and his great films. But the true hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which provides the backdrop for the entire film. It houses the characters, contains the pavements and the roads on which they walk, and sets the background atmosphere for all events, all in beautifully shot scenes. <br /> <br /> The film returns again and again to certain themes (shoes, for example) and, in essence, Salazar makes his metaphors increasingly understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. It combines the sights of the city with the images of the characters and elegantly combines the feeling of the scene in the background. A talented set of actors helps you portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene where Juaquin takes Anita to the other side of the street for the first time. It may not work on a small screen, but it left me crawling easily on a large screen. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is very positive, and consequently the film is light and funny at times. The song throughout the movie is usually pop, with some instrumental pieces (I hope to get my hand on the soundtrack one day, although I seriously doubt that I will). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you'll have to accept my word). So much more I give this movie a solid 8/10.
