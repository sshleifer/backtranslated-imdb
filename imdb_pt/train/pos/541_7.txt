As a sequel, this is not a bad movie. I really liked it, better than the first one. I found it more fun. It seemed like it was documentary style shooting. At first this bothered me, as I thought it just looked very low budget. grew on me, and made the film look more authentic. This film has more of a dry liner than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. I think sometimes they went a little overboard with some of the scenes and the characters.It almost becomes a parody of itself, which may be the movie point.this at least has some suspense, which the first had not, in my opinion.It is some of the same great music of the original, the which is great. The performance again was pretty decent for the most part, although, as I said, some of them seemed overdone. I also felt that the movie lost a lot of momentum at the end and a few minutes that seemed very slow and did not seem to flow like the rest of the movie. However, I thought this was a beautiful sequel. The rating for "Return to Cabin by the Lake" is 7/10 *
