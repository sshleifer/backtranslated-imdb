Taken in the context of the time it was done, I found this a worthwhile movie. While the details can be "dramatized," the overall story was a good primer. In addition, I met famous actors who I knew a real pleasure. Who would have thought Ben Cartwright as a cowardly villain? I'll leave the rest of the star to you. As for the minor cast, this movie (as you would expect from a movie made in the late 30's) has many nice actors, but the best compliments for Andrew Jackson's right-hand man, Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well laid out, with beautiful ships and competent performance everywhere, I recommend this to anyone who likes the camp, or an eye for a double period piece, set in the aurora of the United States, and made in a period when the great names, and top-notch actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.
