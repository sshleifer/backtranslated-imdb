Look is Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who wore "Panther Sex Colony" at Anchorman. If you're expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie then you need to rethink the way you watch the movies. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, you are in the right place. The characters are all funny. They work together very well. The real game is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is as funny as he is in Friends and she was funny and beautiful at the same time. I went with my wife, she liked it and so did I.
