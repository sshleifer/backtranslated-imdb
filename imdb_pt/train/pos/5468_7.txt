I did not see the restored, or any version for that matter, of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I picked it up at TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell, Lily lives on a speakeasy, she was discarded by her own father since she was 14! Then he still explodes and he is killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone to take care of his black maid Chico, played very well by Theresa Harris. Lily goes to the big city (New York) to decide to use her sex to get to the top. She does it in style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a chubby clerk to enter the ground floor and passes men as candy disposable! One abandons his fiancee and kills his next law-father, also Lily's sugar daddy, and then commits suicide! Lily does not blink! STanwyck is great as a girl who really does not know what love is. <br /> <br /> So in Paris, she falls in love with Courtland, played by George Brent, they get married, but when he's in deep financial trouble, she screws up. Almost free with Chico and half a million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily runs to meet him, but does she arrive too late? <br /> <br /> This is pre-code Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music of the film is perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored film with an amoral woman, those who did not like ultra-romantic movies slopes, will not like Baby FAce anymore, those with a belief in sex, love and power, love. Highly recommended! Look!
