For starters, it's a very funny movie with some crazy characters running around who are forced to make fun (check out the two Russian insects). <br /> <br /> Insect life has a classic Disney plot, but that's one of the good things about the movie. The family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution to confront the locusts at the end. And there's also some great voices from Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course) ... But, in fact, the most incredible thing about this movie is the animation. It's simply wonderful. All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful scenery ... And the boys and girls of Pixar made everything seem so realistic. All in all, a good job. This is the best Disney animation since Aladdin.
