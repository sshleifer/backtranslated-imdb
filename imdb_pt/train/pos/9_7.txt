Martin Ritt's romantic drama of working class is as unbelievable as they are, but there are moments of pleasure mainly due to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both great). She is a widow who can not move on, is illiterate and closet inventor - you can probably guess the rest. Adapted from Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a better title!), It's so relaxed that it borders on insensitivity, and the film's set-up is a mess, but it's still nice; a blue-collar costume in pink tones. There are no openings for serious issues (even the angle of illiteracy is just a plot tool for the following love story) and no real fireworks, although the characters are intentionally a little colorless and the leads diminished to an interesting level . The ending is pure fluff - and the cynics will find it hard to swallow - although these two characters merit a happy ending and the image would not be really satisfying otherwise. *** in ****
