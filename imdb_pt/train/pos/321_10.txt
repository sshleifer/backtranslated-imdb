I do not know how or why this movie has a poor rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I'm Curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will let you down in this movie is that if you do not like the movie process, do not like psychology or if you were expecting a pornographic hardcore. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you will want to watch to relax; is a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARIES, MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO ******* <The main thing about this movie is that it blends the entire movie, within a movie thing , but does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that fictions are not real. <br /> <br /> The film is like many films in one: 1. A political documentary about the social system in Sweden at the time. Which in many ways are still relevant to today. Interviews by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A narrative about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, making a movie ... he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should never have gotten involved with people with whom he should work . <br /> <br /> 3 The movie that Vilgot is doing. It 's about a young woman named Lena (IE # 2), who is young and very politically active, she is making a documentary (IE # 1). She is also maturing and entering into her sexuality, and the freedom of it. <br /> <br /> The magnificence and brightness of "I am curious: yellow / blue" is how these three elements are cut together. At one point you are attending a policy interview, and the next is to see what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but does it so well that sometimes you forget what the narrative is. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamics between "yellow" and "blue", that if you see one, you should see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel. I'll try to explain as best I can because, as far as I know, no other movie has done this, although it's a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "Yellow" as something alive, real events in 14 scenes. A complete story. Think of "Blue" as all things BETWEEN the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you did not see, which is a complete story by itself. <br /> <br /> Essentially they are parallel films ... the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I completely understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this has been helpful to people who are being discouraged by various influences because this movie changed the way I looked at the movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
