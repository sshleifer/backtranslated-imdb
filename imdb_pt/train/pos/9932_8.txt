If you go to this movie expecting something other than that, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as the "iceberg effect." On the surface, it's simply a cache of random movie clips to create a movie. If this were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) may well pass for you. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography hardly describes this film. Camera work and post-production add a lot to the overall taste of the film, making it quite artistic in some spots and open to interpretations in others (something to be desired in American movies lately). Although in some parts it may get a bit cheeky, horrible and too heavy for some audiences, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write as "needs improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. No movie is good without a proper soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is well-suited, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs could have been replaced by something more appropriate (heavy rock or psychedelic). Electronica would have made this movie a real trip). The flood of dynamic color palettes and images adds another "artistic" aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie that you can miss anywhere and still understand. However, this also makes it a much more desirable movie to watch, not one that will tire you quickly. 8.5 / 10
