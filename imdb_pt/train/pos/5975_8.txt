Every movie critic and metal director hated this movie, but I liked it. I saw this as a kid on TV somewhere and was impressed by the scene where Sammi comes onstage and plays Trick or Treat from Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typical of the 80's, guy is pushed by bullies and asks for supernatural help to beat the bullies, but it goes far and has to be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Place chooses Skippy from Family Ties so Skippy gets a record of Gene Simmons' Tony Fields to comfort him and all hell is lost, the highlight is where Tony sings (stunts) and dance on a metal music before shyt hits the fan. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and stuff, but the music and the overall picture was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
