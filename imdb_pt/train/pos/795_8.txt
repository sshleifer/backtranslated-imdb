Too bad some comments before me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on actual events, a highly publicized case of disappearance and murder that occurred in the Wilmington, Philadelphia, USA region from 1996 to 2000. I have to admit that I was highly skeptical of how Hollywood would dramatize history and actual events . In fact, they were quite impressed with how close they were to what was constantly reported on local news and news from the Philadelphia Inquirer throughout the time period. Of course I immediately showed that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case), who played Fahey, did not look anything like her (Anne Marie was actually prettier). I have to admit that Mark Harmon really set the type of personality that was revealed as that of Capano and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period. The details of the case were right-no deviations from the dramatic effect-to the carpet, the gun, the furniture, and the refrigerator. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I met Tom Carper many times in various roles (a good man despite being a politician) and I am so happy that he pulled the strings in the Federal domain needed to solve this heinous crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind the bars.
