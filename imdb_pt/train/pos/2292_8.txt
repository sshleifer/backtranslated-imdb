I just watched this Bugs Bunny (first time he's called here) and Elmer Fudd on ThadBlog as a YouTube link. This was the first time that Chuck Jones directed the "wascally wabbit" and as a result, Bugs has a different voice provided by Mel Blanc than the Brooklyn / Bronx we are most familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he is channeling Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality of the day). Anyway, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs Bunny is all nasty with him, turning the radio aloud, pretending to die after his master repeatedly ejects him from the shower, and saying "turn off the lights!" whenever Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with the different voice, Bugs is definitely your naughty self and I laughed all the time! According to Thad, there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer giving only the house to Bugs after he passed, but this was probably considered very sad, since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point, so it is better that the cut scene is lost. Anyway, I recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
