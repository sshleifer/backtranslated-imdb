I thought it was one of the best sequences I've seen in a while. Sometimes I felt as if I wanted someone to die, Stanley's murder of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was a movie so well done that you were happy when you died. My only problem was that in some scenes it seemed that someone with a home camera was filming and it was strange. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Bright movie.
