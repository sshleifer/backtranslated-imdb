It's been 50 years since a movie was made about romance and mysticism. The only two movies I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used wonderful actors, not stars. In both films, all the actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after World War I who are dissatisfied with their lives and find happiness in Italy during the holidays. It's amazing that "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It stands out as a nice classic.
