I'm not a big fan of martial arts movies, but the video library was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I released it when the other movies I rented, anyway I rented it. I just loved it, my roommate and I (22 year old Biochemistry and Accounting students) spent half an hour after the movie made strange Kung Fu noises and played beer shurikens itself. I can not explain (well, maybe a little tequila). I never liked Bruce Lee, skinny guy kicking big guy, hitting him, kicking bigger movies, etc. Think of Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
