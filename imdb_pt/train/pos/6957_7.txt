My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a fun movie, no more, no less. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and quiet. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and joins her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems fine, but Matt discovers that she is G-Girl. At first, this looks really cool for Matt, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break up with her and stay with his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and she starts getting revenge on her former boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most about the movie are the scenes in which G-Girl takes revenge on Matt. It was also good to see Anna Faris in another role, then her character from the saga of the movie Scary. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy.
