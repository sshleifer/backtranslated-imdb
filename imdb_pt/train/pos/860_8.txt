Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman, in her universe of work as secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life: but the guy is coming out of jail. Both being rejected by society, they are brought together progressively. The description of the characters is deep, goes into detail ... both begin to help each other; because it can read on the lips, which proves very useful to him ... It will evolve progressively, far from what it was at first. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a noir movie in the end. The gesture is particularly well observed in the filming of Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos must be nominated for Best Actess Cesar for his masterpiece. The action at the end of the movie prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". Actually, it's surprisingly fun: 8/10.
