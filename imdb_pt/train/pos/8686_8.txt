The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book", filmed later, reached first the sound waves). Robert Culp, who would pair up with Peter Falk's detective in a number of future versions, is fantastic as the hard head of a sophisticated detective agency that kills a client's wife when she refuses to accept her blackmail schemes. The two stars are well matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series.
