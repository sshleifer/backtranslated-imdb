Edmund Burke said that "all the needs of evil are good for me to do nothing". Hollywood often gives us crap because insufficient families will not see quality movies. This film was an edifying story of the loss and restoration of faith. He had no violence, no perversity, and did not deserve a PG rating. The western setting was filmed well, and some of the views were simply breathtaking. The actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise believable and talented. The score was very high and, in some places, it drowned the dialogue completely. I rarely get surprised with movie finals, but I was pleasantly surprised by that. Sometimes the good guys win and win for honest efforts. We like the movie and the message, and we recommend it for the whole family.
