The father of The Who's alcoholic drummer, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who used to be OVERACTS, did a good job in this, and was able to get around in Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a very "different" movie, allowing the viewer to catch a glimpse of another life. We often try to watch a reprise of this movie on the satellite. God rest Dudley Moore; this was such a nice movie. Too much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby / affluent. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite captivating.
