A bloody gangster story that takes place in the Great Depression years. He tells us about another notorious hit-man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns out to be the opposite: Mike struggles to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed because of his boss's foul play. He gets his revenge and secures an honorable future for his son, but is killed in the end. Such stories never had a happy ending, after all. <br /> <br /> The role of senior Mike Salliwan was beautifully played by Tom Hanks, and part of Rooney (the mob boss) was played by Paul Newman. The movie makes a great impression, and we hear the phrase "we steal banks". This movie is still worth watching, though you might have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American beauty.
