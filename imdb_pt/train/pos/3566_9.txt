In 1954, Marlon Brando was the hottest actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra still needed to reinvent himself on the silver screen. But the portrait of Sinatra as the old Nathan Detroit, helped to restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> It's a great screen version of a great move and the choices of leads and support players are great. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his only singing role when playing Sky Masterson. In addition, the lead women, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (repeating their role onstage as their girlfriend Adelade), put forth superlative efforts. Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye (like Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, Rockin 'The Boat version of No One comes close to Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who would come to fame as TV series producer as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show does "Harry The Horse" wonders, BSPulley is excellent as the rough and rough talking "Big Julie", and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> It's one of the funniest musicals to see, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck be a lady tonight" and brother ... "it's your die"
