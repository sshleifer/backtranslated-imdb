Rising movies are quite common these days. By 1980, "Foxes" really gives its meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character directly. Since she did "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. She is Jeanie, a schoolgirl who has a lot of courage, and seems to come out of any situation she is in. Scott Baio plays Brad before Chachi on "Happy Days." He is considered immature by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, gets the wrong class, pursued by her police father. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party gets totally out of control. Exploring life on the other side of the rails can be fun or dangerous. Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time, whenever she is wasted. The reality comes back where she is killed in a car accident. And one marries a much older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In fact, you need to be careful with the people around you. For me, I was my own person and I tend to stay that way! Great song, great storyline, this movie is a jewel! 4 out of 5 stars!
