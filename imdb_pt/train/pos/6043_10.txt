I saw the movie freebird and I think it's great! its fun relaxed, about the time that the British film industry went through with something fun! It is good as the guy who met them at the service station is mentioned in the movie in the news agents, good contact. The acting was compelling (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some good times I had on the bike scene. It was good to see the film director getting into acting, well done jon! In the end, a new culture is mentioned, in Ireland is this the basis for a second film? I hope this keeps them coming. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!
