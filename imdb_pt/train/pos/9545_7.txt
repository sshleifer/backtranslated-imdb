I do not know if I recommend this movie to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as an obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is similar, the editing is equally frenetic and fast - which is good because, in addition to making the film more dynamic, it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is much more blood, less eroticism and, in the case of the "meatball machine", the transformation of the human being into a creature that is partly a machine (sounds familiar?) called "Necroborg" original) is caused by viscous aliens. <br /> <br /> These slimy outbursts of sidereal space use humans as vases for their gladiator games as they play with each other. They infest the body, somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts, pulling them out of nowhere and turning it into a killing machine that hits other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat another alien that is in another Necroborg, pluck it from the corpse and eat it. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot sounds a little silly and I did not expect much, but in the end I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a low budget movie, but it is still relatively decent. Do not expect too much from the actors, they are not very good, but they can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the blood, certain bizarre situations and the way the film is directed and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
