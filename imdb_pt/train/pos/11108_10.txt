Well ... easily my favorite TV series. Call me a walking cliche, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. in a show and you're already earning points in my book. Combine all that with acting that surpasses anything you've ever seen on the big screen, add direction that fits into vintage cinema, and, most of all, writing that blows the mind (and a few brains a long way) and you Above all there are two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, it fits into his role a way words can not express, if you have not seen him as Tony, but see now! <br /> <br /> I can keep talking about each character in the series, the psychological brilliance, the excitement scenes etc, but you would not be able to stop me, so all I can say is that this is the only show along with Seinfeld, which I am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more.
