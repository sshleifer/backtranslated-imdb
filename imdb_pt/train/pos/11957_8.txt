Great Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I met, along with the audience, laughing a lot and often at some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard for some time. The aged Allen has created an appropriate role for himself as the "father" of Scarlett Johansson ... well, more or less. Some have said that Johansson plays "a young Dianne Keaton". I beg to differ. She interprets Woody's dialogue, which in her comedies always has a very similar feel ... like, well, a Woody Allen comedy. That's good for us amateurs Woody. She certainly made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of her latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's mood tiring, but for those of us who love it when it's done right, we're looking forward to the next.
