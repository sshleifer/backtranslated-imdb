I have loved good times with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL comments. The writers of the show were fantastic and the actors were beyond TALENT. Replying to Strawberry22 (the purest commentary on the other review and positive) ... What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I think it was a truck accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode ( when it aired for the first time and I was a tiny thing ... it was so sad for me ..). <br /> <br /> Florida and the kids really come off the projects and even become neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL the children have achieved their dreams and found opportunities in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I truly believed in their fate. I hope this kind of ending really rings true for many. <br /> <br /> A great show and many other great shows were followed, including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was an amazing period for African-American television and the best writers were incredible at the time. LAND TV is awesome for the memories and I just LOVE it because I can not stand the crap we're watching today. SOMEBODY ... bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly ... your smart viewers are an endangered breed and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, a TV Land sitcom addict of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "ALL in the Family" ... these were the days ......
