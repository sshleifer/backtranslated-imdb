When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was carried away by the human drama exhibited by Gabriel Nobody and those with whom he cares and loves. That said, we now get the film version of a great story and hope to see beyond the glitz of Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner really succeeded! With the right amount of restraint, Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his fight with trust issues in both his personal life (Jess) and the world around him (Donna) . <br /> <br /> As we introduce ourselves to the players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can irrevocably change our lives. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life-changing event and helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to continue and move on. <br /> <br /> It's bad that most people avoid this movie. . I only say this because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role? That did not work before!" PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A POSSIBILITY! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through ourselves to be better people. Like his film One Hour Photo, he performed as an actor and made another quality work of art. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he's in. the leading man of the 1940s looks and represents the screen. It's this hacking opinion that he could take his own movie now !! <br /> <br /> S ~
