I watched this movie many years ago and have been looking for it ever since, in my opinion, though raw is very educational about what the future can hold I enjoyed the film and for this day to evaluate very loudly sorry to all those who disagree but a movie should always be judged by each one of them and, in my opinion, it's great to try with all the cloning babies and test tube that are happening today, which is us to judge this movie, this can be a dramatized event of the which is to become, but there you go. All the horrors of today are so improbable that I even laugh, but this makes me think and scares me as a mother and if I was desperate, after watching this movie I would think twice, sorry, but I love the movie, make your own mind Do not watch the movie - just recognize the story and ask yourself how far you would go for a child?
