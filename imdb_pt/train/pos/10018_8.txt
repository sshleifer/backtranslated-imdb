This Night Listener is better than people are usually saying. It has weaknesses, and seems to be having a gender identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its scary atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for it. The whole thing looks like one of those ghost stories "this happened to a friend of a friend of mine". One big complaint about the movie is the rhythm: but the slow and sometimes strange rhythm is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept within the realm of possibility, and real life simply moves on, does not it? So there are no flamboyant endings or earth-shaking revelations or showdown scenes. Thank Heaven You have to get into the area when you watch this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations about what makes a (conventionally) good movie. Williams is not terrific, but he easily satisfies the needs of the story, and his character is supposedly generic ("Nobody"), since he is Everyman, the avatar we ourselves enter into history. Toni Collette's performance must be nominated for an Oscar (even though she may not win). Take a chance. Just for quality and content, Night Listener is certainly among the twenty percent of the movies that appear in the last few days.
