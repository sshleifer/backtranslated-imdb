This is the bar none the most hilarious movie I have ever seen. Beginning with the four delinquents being sent by their parents to the Wienberg Military Academy, a tone is set that constantly continues throughout this film, and it does not diminish for a second. <br /> <br /> It's hard to try. describe this movie; the mood elements are so visible and brilliantly realized that at first glance it looks like nothing more than a teenage comedy of the 80's. But it's so much more than that! Fresh from the minds of those folks in MAD magazine, Up the Academy serves a formula and style that I've never seen duplicated by any of the funniest deals to come out of Hollywood last year. Basically, the film is so full of childish material that you can imagine that the writers were a couple of 14 years. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". One classic. *****
