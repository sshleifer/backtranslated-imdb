What the movie The 60 really stands for (for those of us who snore in the belly of America in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated and stereotyped characters, the genuineness of the issues remains clear. <br /> <br /> It was not just those radical times of change but also very confusing times. Two basic things have changed our world: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new liberties initiated social changes that soon became institutionalized. From the chaos came the sensitivity, from the clutter came values. Bear in mind, however, that most Americans were not involved in this ... they worked, played, watched the news ... and little by little they were affected by the struggles and struggles of minorities ... Civil Rights workers , political activists, anti-war efforts, the war on poverty ... <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular was well reflected, although the conflict between the attitude of the the public at large and those who sought to change things were at best ignored ... and, at worst, misrepresented. Middle-class Americans were not all standing up in anger, holding baseballs or reneging on their rebellious daughters. They too were confused. Let's not forget how the Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers, and how the Beatles started an onslaught that killed the Folk-Protest movement. There are no Beatles songs in the movie, or even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think if you have not lived the decade, you may not have a notion of what the film is, the picture is a little weak. At one point I held a steady job while my sister lived at Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another time, I was in Haight Asbury and the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles were constantly changing. <br /> <br /> The film portrays three brothers from a middle-class family. They represent the hippie child, the political activist, and the active military personnel. Dad represents typical attitudes, and the mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes commitment ... for peace. <br /> <br /> The Black family is made up of a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle for limitations, or else the film would have become a long, boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message addressed to young people today. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems, and also how issues divide us ... The 60s were unusual in that sense, and only the roaring 20s compare. In other words, this movie has a moral after all. In the end, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put this on your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a guru, or a free-spirited genius in the 1960s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever preach the '60s down right ... it was very diverse (this movie is coming). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of this, that we have learned and grown with it, and that, for once, a generation has shaped and changed America ... for the better.
