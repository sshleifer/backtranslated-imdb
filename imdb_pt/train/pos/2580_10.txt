I say the domino principle is a hugely understated movie. Anyone who has taken time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and indeed many others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino The principle really knew about what he was talking about. Troyer could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh. To mention a few conspiracy scenarios involving spies, big business, and political assassinations. is not really a fiction, but an ominous part of our complicated existential history. Help us, but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy. If this causes a small loss of sleep, maybe you should not. investigate for themselves.
