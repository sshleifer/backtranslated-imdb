Before Cujo, there was Lucky the dog of the devil. In 1978, on Halloween night, he premiered the movie "Dog of the Devil, the Hound of Hell". The story of a family getting a new puppy (from a farmer who happens to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because his Skipper dog was killed. Conclusion? Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> It does not take long until Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where the Boys Are, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different and her sons Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw in those witch mountain movies. This is one of the many horror movies made for the 70's TV that was really scary for a horror movie made for TV. The music was creepy and until the end I will not tell you made you think. <br /> <br /> This film also stars Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from the devil's movies, remember "Running with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
