A couple (Janet and Richard) are going to camp in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes refuge in what they think is an abandoned farmhouse. Soon, two convicted fugitives appear and, after much delaying the inevitable, they continue to rape Janet and trap Richard in a cage. <br /> <br /> This LAST LEFT HOUSE has to be one of the most underrated horror films of all time. It is one of the sickest and most distorted shocks of the early 1970s. I also find it very charming and beautiful in a perverse tone. I love CAGED TERROR. The song definitely helps to give a sense of personality to the film, plus a lot of beauty. I found the film quite scary. <br /> <br /> The flaws have to do mainly with the rhythm of the film, which means that the film is rather slow and sinuous. Although I did not mind the rhythm due to the beauty and suspense of the movie in question, I think this will be for most people. The acting is not so good or the dialogue, at least in the first scenes. This movie takes a little more patience than usual, and it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a good movie. It's not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it sure is a lot of fun. It's not exactly the easiest movie to find. You can find it in the USED section of many stores if you look closely. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of junk cinema then it's definitely worth checking out.
