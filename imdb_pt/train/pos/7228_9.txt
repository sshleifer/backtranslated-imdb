The undisputed highlight of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn, wildly comical and terribly tragic. Does anyone do better than O'Toole? I think not. What a great face this man has! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in some parts (especially in the end), but it is also strangely touching and successful on many levels. However, I felt that the film basically revolved around the luminous performance of Peter O'Toole and I'm sure he would not have enjoyed even half that if he had not participated.
