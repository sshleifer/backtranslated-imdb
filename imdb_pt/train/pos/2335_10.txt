That's what t.v. should be. And pushing daisies lives up to those expectations. A well-crafted and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows in prime time that has integrity, is good for the whole family and awakens your imagination. It's not about the normal action, the sex, the money or the murder angles of all the other tv shows It's a program that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot seems impossible, the concepts are real for all of us . Wanting something you can not have, waiting for someone to want you, running away from your past and looking for family, even in the most unlikely places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I realize that ABC has basically canceled this wonderful show at this point, and will probably replace it with some show beyond the point of integrity. I suppose everything comes back to the money ... it's a shame that there are no other shows on ABC that really make you feel good after watching.
