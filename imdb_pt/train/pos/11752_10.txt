For all Has-Beens or Never Was or for the curious, this movie is for you ... Have you practiced any sport, or imagined what it would be like when the lights went out and the crowd left ... this movie explores this and more. Robin Williams (Jack Dundee) is a small-town assistant banker in Taft CA, whose life has been plagued by an evil in a big rival collegiate football game 13 years ago when he dropped the pass that would have won Bakersfield, his Arch-Rival, who takes great pleasure in beating Taft Rockets season after season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was the Quarterback in this famous game, and is the local legend, who now specializes in van repairs, whose life is disappearing in lethargy, like the town of Taft itself. <br /> <br /> Williams has an idea to remake the story by repeating the game! He comes across a skeptical resistance, so he makes a man's terror spree, and literally paints the city, orange, yellow and black, to increase the ire of the villagers to recreate the game. After the success, the players of the 1972 team meet and try to get in shape to practice, which is hysterical. The game is on, Bakesfield is loaded with all the high tech gadgets, game strategies and sophisticated training routines. Taft is drawing pieces in the mud, with sticks, stones and bottle caps, that revolts! Taft overcomes the odds, Robin Willians purges the demons from their guts, Kurt Russell rises from lethargy, watches "The Best of Times" for one of the BEST viewing experiences of all time! <br /> <br /> One of Robin Williams's best performances, the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magical. And who is Kid Lester? <br /> <br /> Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances as the wives of Williams and Russell. Gets success on many levels. A 10!
