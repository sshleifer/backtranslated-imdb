- SMALL SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at the votes for "Creep" today, I was surprised by so many IMDb users who rated this movie "1". I'm wondering: what do people expect from this kind of movie? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a horror movie and it's very good! This automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, scandalous dangers and simple characters on one side. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, get comfortable in your place and then ... ... enjoy yourself scared to die! The first 60 minutes, when there's almost nothing but Kate and a solitary subway station, are incredibly scary. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you are going to give yourself a few jerks just because of a sudden sound of a flashing neon lamp on the back of you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie). <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her stalker, the quality of the movie falls, but it still does not become a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the bloody effects are well done and the story is well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that it's a horror movie you're watching and not the Discovery Channel!) So if you want to become a very, very scary hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and then leave the cinema or your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, do not you? The thug will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: get out of the theater in the dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
