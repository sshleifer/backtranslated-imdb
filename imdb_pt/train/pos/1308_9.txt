I must say that I really had no idea that I would sit and watch this movie. I think it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between classes. But for the first time, a TV movie interested me. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my attention. I really was not a huge fan of her before this movie. Of course I liked Twister and as good as that. But something about this movie really did it for me. Now I see myself as a big fan. This movie comes with high notes of ... me. Take a chance, you will not be disappointed.
