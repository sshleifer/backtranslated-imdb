I had the privilege of watching "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) walks into Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her. We followed the difficult journey through Cambodia and waited for their meeting. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The film portrays this difficult problem without crossing the line. I went away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can I help? This film must be seen by everyone, because it is a beautiful story and exposes a problem that we should not ignore.
