Great. Bold and true portrait of pioneer farm life on the western plains with an emphasis on woman's role and place. A moving film, made with love and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget independent film; I've never made money. It's definitely not the romantic and unrealistic Hollywood version of the life of the pioneers.
