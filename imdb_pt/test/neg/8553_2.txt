An ugly cell-cell movie sits on the bottom of the barrel of the midnight movie, combining the lusty sordeto with the girls' most chic clich√©s in the shower. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learned she was involved in running a guy with her car), facing difficulties in the Big House with some of the most unpleasant characters on this side of a photo of Russ Meyer. Blair is continually assaulted, beaten, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is disgusting everywhere, and the film offers no respite from its wave of violence and stupidity. Still, some viewers see it as a camp classic, though perhaps their tongue is not far enough on the cheek. * in ****
