Whenever I see a video like this, I have to wonder how it was financed. HBO or Showtime, or whatever, must pay for the producer to follow the proposals - hire someone who can or can not speak English to get stoned and do something that comes close to a plot, pay strippers with horrible breasts to jump and down on the torsos of coarsely waxed faces, to find people to project and illuminate scenarios, to buy the rights to techno brega music, etc. But I have to imagine that this has to be a vanity project for anyone who is serving as executive producer ... He had to have nailed all those girls, right? And the brother is not wrong about the "Spanish girl", but calling the police "dazzling" is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to call them something much closer to "hideous" or "fleeting". Watching these women squirm - sometimes * clearly * high in painkillers - was so far from being erotic that my testicles actually rose inside my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time on this when there is so much hardcore pornography freely available on the internet? I wonder if the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry ... One can only hope, right?
