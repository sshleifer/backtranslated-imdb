I must admit, though embarrassed, that as a young impressionable teenager, this pair of horror coolers was one of my favorite movies of all time. Nine years after seeing Stephen King's scary story for the first time, however, I have now come to my senses and am able to evaluate Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably. In fact, King's story of a small farming community in Nebraska by a demonic preacher and his sadistic helper is really disturbing on paper, but it does for a cheap, medium-on-celluloid horror show. Much of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to turn into a hacker-slasher program, and then turns the ending into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare. <br /> <br /> The cast is reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this is amazing, the film will allow, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is scarier than the photos. <br /> <br /> A pity that George Goldsmith's script turned Stephen King's astounding tale into shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Sons of Corn" are not really that scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
