I'll confess that once I started watching this movie, it held me back and forced me to watch until the conclusion. Quite possibly this was a latent trend of voyeurism in me that wanted to see our hero get involved with the victim, or maybe the fascination they got to make, distribute and show that film that kept me looking for merit, or possibly some fantasy bizarre realization of desires that there may be a point at the end of all the pain. But do not be so lucky. <br /> <br /> So, you're warned not to start watching it in the first place, so that the same thing does not happen to you. There is nothing here that would be worth wasting your hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The first-person documentary and the chat about Fabian's "quest" to impregnate Falkland Island women is even more revealing as a freshman student. high school freshman, that is) movie student project of what you imagine. The effect turns out to be a mockery of the locals (who, in addition to the two professional leaders, are actually real people) and engaging in rather disgusting sex politics (it does not matter whether you take it literally or symbolically, it's useless and sexist). <br /> <br /> The reason why I ended up seeing all the way is the same reason why once someone starts picking a mange there is an irresistible fascination to continue to do it until you are completely gone, even when you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens. In the end, this is a rather dishonest film, because it seems that ultimately there is no moral center, no elucidation of the local political situation, nor any place in the type. of the politico-sexual-personal universe of the cinema to the Goddard. In short, he has nothing to say and he spends a lot of time pretending he does. Smug would be the slogan of a word. <br /> <br /> I would suggest to the filmmakers to rent 'Waiting for Guffman' a few times, or even 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to continue with the schtick. a little more style and a little more genuine emotion. Or at least entertainment value.
