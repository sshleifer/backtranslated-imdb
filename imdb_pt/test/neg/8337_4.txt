Extravagantly naughty craziness about the lava spewed out of the tar pit of La Brea in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ridiculous premise, you will still be howling at the empty dialogue, the absurd plot plans, and the reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his career. This was Tommy Lee Jones' turn. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is so pathetic that even he falls on fire (oops, sorry for that). Most of the supporting cast is also suffocated by banal writing; some of the actors simply call their papers. Anne Heche deserves special recognition from the Hall of Shame for her clumsy portrait of a scientist. She is as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even he would have at least done a better acting job. <br /> <br /> As scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here, I would suggest that you film the movie with friends and play "Find the scientific nonsense". The loser might be forced to listen to the movie's cheesy lines as "Everybody Looks the Same" repeatedly. Here's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect: a scheme to blow up a building is planned, designed, and the dynamite is fired and detonated in a space of approximately 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the compulsory clich√©s of catastrophic films: divorced parents, scientists who are ignored by everyone, unfriendly cops, tough street kids, spoiled teenagers, ambitious investors, etc .; all are present and abundant. The film also hits the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness. <br /> <br /> For cheese fans and foolishness only. All other spectators: be careful.
