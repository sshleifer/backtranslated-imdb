..but unfortunately no one thought of having Van killed to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about it in the movie is its pleasant voice ... pity that the songs are generally bland and felt. Why did I hate Van so much? Well, over the course of the movie, he seemed to be doing a third-class imitation with Soupy Sales - with lots of assaults, bad jokes and a lot of energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he was "teaching" the class - these kids would laugh at everything he did. Damn, Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy pictures and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad decision in the movie - he was the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) playing an Asian was ridiculous, just as Michael York played Peter Finch's brother !! The bottom line is that because of these insane cast choices, the movie was doomed from the start ... and the worst of them was the terrible Bobby Van. Now in real life he could have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip his tongue out so he would be quiet. <Br /> <br /> Now I also mentioned the songs - egad, those terrible songs !! Frank Capra's original LOST HORIZON was a subtle delight everywhere - not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bunch of songs that did nothing to help the movie? They only served to make it look like a sticky mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLOR combined with the LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sickly childish film - which can not be enjoyed by anyone over 8 years old. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can remove these problems, you have the basis of a decent movie. After all, the plot is lovely and still hidden under all the goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (although certainly not equal to Ronald Colman in the original). But considering that the original was an almost perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to cross the molasses? <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this movie was included in the book "The 50 Worst Films", by Harry Medved. Although I did not like the movie, it was not bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included primarily because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book - not just one of the best selections for the "holy hall" of dreck.
