Surely this movie was hacked by the studio? perhaps not, but I think there were serious flaws in the narrative that, if not attributed to the editing process, could only be caused by grossly bad, criminal, written, and directed. <br /> <br /> I understand the effect that the burton wanted. achieve with the stylized performance similar to the gothic fairy-tale atmosphere of Edward's scissors, but here, unfortunately, it falls and reaches no mythical depths of tropes but only the offensive trap of affectation. that is, poor acting and superficial characterization even for a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's not so scary, in fact, just slightly fun in your attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for the background of the plot was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of the headless knight would suffice, there is no need for the myth about a German mercenary, though Christopher Walken has made a bold but not so threatening figure - seeing the knight's head makes him seem more friendly than an inhuman beheaded nine feet tall. spirit as in the original legend. <br /> No real rhythm or universal tone has ever been established and not a classic in burrow oevure. blistered and cut like my farewell shot ...
