The Hollywood film industry is the laziest in the world. It only needs a single success to flood the theaters with the same old crap reinvented repeatedly. Take the superheroes, for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. The Japanese horror remakes are even worse. It only took The Ring, which was perfect (mainly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of horrors resembling scary women, eg. Ring 2, The Eye, Black Water (which was fine, but meaningless), and the resentments. <br /> <br /> The first Rancor was not totally bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one might expect of it. In addition, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Rancor 2 is exactly like the previous one; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy Men in Black II? Was it a cool thing to slash the whole script and change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic follows the same path. <br /> <br /> Tired prisons, poor acting (with the exception of Amber Tamblyn) and cliches everywhere. Three stories happen in different places and times. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what took his sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by his colleagues to visit the house where the incident described in the first film occurred; and finally an American family who witnesses strange things happening in the apartment next door. I'm happy to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up in the end, but one should not rely on the end to make a good image when everything else is just tiresome and boring. <br /> <br /> shivers are everywhere, a girl alone in the closets, someone who should not go into a house, others who dig deep. Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill and kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, does not this look like a bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yes, day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge against Hollywood bullshit.
