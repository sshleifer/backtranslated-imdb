I rarely see a movie with such a cast, a potentially strong story based on a bestselling book that has been so weak and to some extent unattainable ... <br /> <br /> The premise of a story looks like an O Brent Easton Ellis's novel - many drugs, hopelessness and self-induced tragedy when young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to deal with being a suicidal loser, who seems unable to accept that she is actually living a good life and that basically she's pathetic for being a baby ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci is not only playing a tragic character, but also a tragic actor who hiccups and screams for most of the movie. in fact it makes you want to scream - kill yourself already and let us get to the credits rolling ... The director does not help, since he provides absolutely no rhythm and the story seems so disjointed that you have no idea what that damn girl is really making about. The director apparently was in Prozac directing this imitation of a movie and therefore leaving the film on autopilot, making it an unbearable mess. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming features are a friendly Jason Biggs, as Wurtzel's boyfriend (who fortunately decided to abandon the self-indulgent egocentric egocentric) and an unbelievably good Jessica Lange as the crying mother. Lange apparently can not be overthrown by terrible script, directing and terrible co-actors. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's really who Wurtzel is or who he was, but the film has left me totally disinterested in his writings. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I finished watching this movie and immediately began to think: OK. Time to watch something, which is actually about real problems ...
