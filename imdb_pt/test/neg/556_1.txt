Hillary Swank is an unattractive job in this unattractive movie job. Pat Morita, desperate for work, any kind of work, agreed to reprise his role as the "karate teacher" and bring his Karate brand onto the silver screen again, except this time Hillary "skank" Swank is the student. I can only see the writers of Hollywood getting carried away with the idea of ​​having a woman "tormented and spoiled pampered" assuming the role of Ralph. The movie does not work on any level and is annoying on all levels. There is nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for someone to grab. The movie was made without any thought of making money because it is so bad. <br /> <br /> I would be happy to spit on all the actors in this movie for having gotten involved with it and having the writers blacklisted for their movie. miserable and insulting efforts.
