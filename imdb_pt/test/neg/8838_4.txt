I watched the start twice, I could not understand, and it bothered me throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So solve this with me: Wayne (the GOOD guy) jumps on the errand, disarms the drivers (!), steals the money (?!) and takes off. <br /> <br /> Disarmed, one driver is killed and the other is injured by the bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then watched this happen. <br /> <br /> So Wayne throws the money on the ground, rescues the girl, rides to the city, laughs with Yak (face of the dead guy, I think) ... and then says he "found" the money back to the place. And everyone is fine with that. <br /> <br /> And he's the cool guy? And I'm sure there were no small hand-held lanterns at that time. And Bell made his first telephone demonstration in 1876 ... were they in homes then? I'm thinking a lot about this? Usually, I'm glad to suspend the trial to enjoy a movie, but this one bothered me. And that's a sign that change has not really worked for me.
