Of all the adaptations of Alistair MacLean's books, I feel this qualifies as the worst, but do not blame MacLean!. It seems that everything this movie shares with the novel is the same title. We have no suspense, no sense of foreboding mystery, no chance to really empathize with the main characters. We spent the entire duration (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to spill her clothes (for Charlotte, this seems to take a remarkably long time!). Still, a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling's breasts really can not save this disastrous movie. MacLean was once again kicked in the gutter to withstand the onslaught of those bitter hackers and nit-pickers who seem to blame him for all the ills that have gone on in trying to film his books. Poor old Alistair must have crawled in a corner and whimpered when this one left. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the name of Maclean, but apparently none of his novels - was a little exciting. The excitement here is in waiting for the final credits.
