Bad, bad and did I mention it wrong? In addition to the comic monster terrorizing the workers, the funniest part of the movie was when the surveyors are in the desert and one of them commented that they have an hour of daylight, but you can see clearly through their shadows, and through the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT DIRECTOR! The only cool part of this film, apart from Clara Bryant's rack, of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the ghost skeleton horse in which the Bone Eater is headed. That was very cool, as he chased the topographers on his motorcycles.
