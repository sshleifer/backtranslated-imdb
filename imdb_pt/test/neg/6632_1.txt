This should not have been turned into a movie. Everything was stupid and I do not think I've even laughed once. There were bits and pieces that were good I guess but that's about it. Many parts were very similar to many other films that made them much better. There were some famous actors / actresses in this, but no one did a good job, they just did not care. This is one of those movies that tries to have a "fluffy" ending, but it was so stupid that it literally had no redeeming values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one! <br /> <br /> Final Decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> DVD purchase: Absolutely not! <BR> Rent: Only if you've seen EVERYTHING else and got a free coupon, but even then it's still not worth it.
