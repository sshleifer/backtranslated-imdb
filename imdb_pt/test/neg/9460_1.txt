Before seeing this movie, I believed that there were two types of bad cinema. (1) Your average, completely uninspired rate (ie, "Constantine"), and (2) work that is delightfully bad, or so bad, is good (a la "Hand Hands of Fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore" I know there's a third kind of bad movie: the absolute crap sandwich. This will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A job that is painfully execrable. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I hated certain movies before, but I've never hated a movie so much that my disgust has reached its limit and has become disgusting! Have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the time you spent watching, but also makes you suffer for another hour after that? The disciples of the Mystery Science Theater should be careful, this is a cinema that sucks the soul. Go rent "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
