Well, first of all, as many critics have pointed out - this is a feature of Martin Cahill's story - first represented by the BBC and John Boorman's film, "The General," which is a great film and much, much better than this. Speaking as a native British person, the support cast for Kevin Spacey was very good in terms of British and Irish talent, especially Peter Mullan - but it was totally wasted. The characters were c ** p! And as for Kevin Spacey - he did not look like a lovable rascal, but like nothing really substantial or significant. <br /> <br /> There is not much to redeem this movie. The best parts are the jokes and tricks stolen from the other movies he rips. Compare notes about this movie and "The General" - I would be interested to see what others think. <br /> <br />
