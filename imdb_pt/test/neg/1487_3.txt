The presentation is very poor. (for my notion) as documentaries generally are. The "documenatry" of Michael Moore - Farenheit 911 is much more convincing, but has too much media and political influence. I can not wait until Saturday when I get to see the documentary "The Game of the Lives". IFC goes to the center right. I started a collection of IFC films from outside the internet due to "TGOTL" ********** *** in "Decade". Want to see good documentaries? Stick to the History Channel .. Or try the docudrama. You can not make a mistake with them, my friend. I can not go wrong. The seventies were ten years of reruns. Or old times want you to believe. Disco died and is gone forever. When Elvis died or yes, all of us suffer.
