Movie Title - Tarte <br /> <br /> Date reviewed - 26/5/02 <br /> <br /> Year of the movie - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro , Bijou Phillips (only), Melanie Griffith (only) <br /> <br /> NeCRo rating - 4 skulls out of 10 <br /> <br /> May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Land < A "outcast" Dominique Swain wants to be with the group "in" and then she leaves her real friends and joins them ... ... there is a lot of talk from rich and annoying people. Acting <br /> <br /> ugh, I think I got what I wanted, because Dominique was fine, but dude, the rest of the cast, plus maybe Brad Renfro, was bad or at least uninteresting or lovable. I know some might say that others were good because they made me hate them ... trust me ... I like nasty charades, but this group is nasty because they can not be convincingly bad people. <br /> </> The figures show that the only other people I bought for this were Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had was ok. Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character though small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly under attack by horrible dialogues and very, very annoying characters. that's enough violence !! Okay, there was a bullet with a stone that was okay. <br /> <br /> Hahaha, they could not even add nudism to help spice up this movie, probably because no one would want to support their body for that crap. If they are going to expose themselves, they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their characters and not by "oh hey I heard she gets naked in this". I know I pride myself on being the person who might like it most if not almost every movie or at least find something good in it. Well, this movie is one of the few that I really struggled to find something worthwhile. The problem with this movie is that it is very annoying. I already have a deep hatred for the attitudes of rich and snobby people and this did not help either. This whole thing really is, it's just a bunch of rich people sitting around, depressed and stupid. I can not emphasize enough annoying factor. This movie tries to redo the plot "In group", which has already been tested and tested, and can usually be done ok with little difficulty. <br /> <br /> Why do not I have a picture of the movie or the cover of the box? Well, I felt that this movie did not deserve this glory, so I decided to put a picture of why I rented it, and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain. Yes, I was also courted by her on Lolita and I thought she was so good that I decided to check out any movie she plays in there. At least I keep my promises and yes I've seen most of his films, but some are hard to find. She herself is a great actress and I actively defended her, but dearly, she chooses some of the worst movies to star in. This movie and the Smokers are in the same crap boat, but at least Smokers got a cool idea for a story. and even some really good scenes. <br /> <br /> In addition, the DVD box tries to fool you, making you think that this movie also has stars, putting the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips in front of the box. If there's one thing that P **** S me off is a movie that plasters the names of the stars in a box to make you think "wow it has ____ I wonder how good ___is this one I saw ___ in that movie and I thought she was great! "just to get the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2. Bijou actually had a part that meant something. Melanie, on the other hand, has only 2 lines on .... I do not really like Melanie, but this is about ethics and not for acting in the stars. <br /> <br /> Of all this mess, despite props should go to Brad Renfro for transforming into an ok performance along with Dominique. Brad may be a very confused boy in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this movie earns any skull is because I got what I basically wanted, which was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I also had the additional pleasure of watching the underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more. So even though I was bored all the time, I still came up with some good points, although this was pretty difficult this time around. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch this if you've seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you're a fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be very depressed. Also, if you're a fan of bad movies like me, please do not assume it's a guilty pleasure, because you'll feel guilty for the money spent on buying or renting. <br /> <br /> Some movies are "so bad that they are good," as the saying goes. What they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (to let go)". NeCRo
