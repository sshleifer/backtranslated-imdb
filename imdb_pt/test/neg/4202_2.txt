This is a very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would have been unbearable! In addition to the low budget shows great time! Some of the fights were good, but the story is laughable, and there are no menacing villains at all. The dialogue was laughable I had some problems finishing this movie, but Chuck Norris, made it a bit bearable. I really do not have anything else to say, since I was only paying half the attention because it was so incredibly annoying, however, it took a little bit in the end. The direction is terrible. Don Hulette, does a terrible job here, with lousy photographs, a horrible rhythm and, in general, the movie sounded monotonous! There is no blood. The acting was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he kicks that ass, and he made the film almost bearable (Chuck rules!). George Murdock is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor, it's decent here, and he had good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein is decent as Chuck's brother. Overall it is very simple to avoid! * Out of 5 (Chuck saves you from the rank of PUMP).
