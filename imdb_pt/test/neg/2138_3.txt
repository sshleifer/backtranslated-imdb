It's sometimes hard to judge how bad a film made in Italy or Spain is, because they all seem to use the same stable of 9 to 10 ESL trained voice actors to provide the English voices for the US release. And things are always lost in translation - dialogues, character elements, and plot lines written to the expectations of the European public may not go very well with our American ideas about what is funny, modern or dramatic. I imagine that the team responsible for translating the soundtrack for this movie into English had about 3 days to do this from start to finish, and probably each of them earned the equivalent of a pay installment on the Fiat used to do so . In other words, pure work, played in one or two takes and never reviewed or redone by someone with a real ear for the American language. Watching the devil's fish, I can imagine that if you If an Italian watched the presentation in your native tongue, you might have thought it was a small piece of fluff. You would laugh at the "jokes" and the fun drunk, you would pant with the monster and villainy of the bad guys, and you would look at the attractive pair of Peter and not-much-Daryll Hannah as they couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of a search for clues about a man-eating monster who has killed one of his friends. <br /> <br /> But since the dissonant voice acting and the dialogue ingrained We continue to pull Americans from the cinematic experience, we can not fail to notice that the editors had a severe Attention Deficit Disorder, which no one on the screen can actually act as much as designing an Attitude, that the stated reason for creating the monster movie makes absolutely no sense, that the action sequences have all the impact of a bowl of cereal filled with cooked oats and that the director, writers and producers actually they hate women. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about buying or buying. renting this movie - just watch cable TV on Saturday afternoon with one of the several beers on your fist, or with the help and protection of Mike and the Bots on MST3K.
