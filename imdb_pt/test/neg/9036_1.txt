I love the beach boys and their music. So, being me a filmmaker, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys movie looks great. Well, WRONG! I just turned off HDNET, the channel the movie was playing on, because it was too bad. Someone mentioned above about editing ... well, they should have at least looked at the monitors while they were filming. I do not know if someone grabbed the mustache falling from the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife and then he smoothed her again with his hands. You've heard of resuming a scene! Acting was terrible. Direction was terrible. Makeup was TERRIBLE !!! Possibly the worst makeup job I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's "fat" cheeks looked plastic. <br /> <br /> This is honestly the first time I've reviewed the IMDb, and I know it really does not matter ... but come on, what the hell were the producers thinking?!?! !
