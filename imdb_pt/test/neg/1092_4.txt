My mother did not let me watch this movie when I was in second grade because she said it was too violent. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mom, I stayed up and watched PBS. Well, maybe the construction after all this year has led to the great disappointment of this movie, but I found it stupid. He did not age well, and that made the acting unbelievable and huge holes in the script, but there are some cool scenes like car chases and a big gun fight. I will not stand for this movie again.
