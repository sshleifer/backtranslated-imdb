I find it hard to understand what makes the viewer feel that this is a powerful movie. I would say the main intention of this film would be a study of character and the effects of racism in a British community. Therefore, it is all the more disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional and that the performance is at the level of a university performing arts course. I'm always skeptical of "improvisation," another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience that laughed when they certainly should be moved by the story. Racism is a serious issue, but I think a subtle approach to filmmaking works much better than putting it with a trowel.
