This disaster film is a remake of a 1973 film of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose displacement will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term for tsunamis). Of course, this creates a natural premise for a disaster picture, with Hollywood having a field day with films such as Armageddon, Deep Impact, and most recently The Day After Tomorrow, which addresses how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the movies mentioned earlier, they look classics. This catastrophe movie is a disaster, and a huge one in that. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a sign that the movie does not fit, and looks like it has exceeded the run time. <br /> <br /> Special effects are beautiful to see. From satellite-like images of outer space, to the vivid recreation of all conceivable natural disasters that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not make a film palatable, as it is a very good thing, just boring. <br /> <br /> If you had seen the trailer where you were drawn by the specific effects and scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, actually those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a divine way. Things just happen on the screen, with just one attempt to dig deeper and analyze problems closely. It is similar to Godzilla knocking down buildings, and it is as if there were no humans or loss of lives through that single act. As morbid as it may seem, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan does not only suffer a disaster after a disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash chaos on such an epic scale. Trying to weave a novel into the film, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each of them lacks real features, or humanity, and it looks like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very rigid and unconvincing. Heroes get trapped in generic control rooms by issuing declarations, instructions, and forms policies, and react to incidents as if it were a computer game, all solved at the push of a button. These are characters you do not give a shit about. <br /> <br /> If I can use the Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, as long as there are tremendous effects, there is at least one attempt to provide a microscopic result. view of the whole disaster from the point of view of different individuals. And there are many sequences of action, great as the disasters themselves, and small with focus on the triumph of the human spirit, which makes it relatively attractive. Sadly for the Sinking of Japan, this movie should be preferentially one to sink and tank, and we expect to suffer a short and quick death at the local box office to pave the way for better things.
