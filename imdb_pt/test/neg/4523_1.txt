I've never seen the TV series or the previous films. That's probably why I did not like it very much. Boring and just not funny, it sums it up. Considering the budget that the film seemed to have, it's embarrassing that they could not do a still reasonable job. <br /> <br /> We went to the movies with no exceptions, and hope to see a rather funny movie that would not be too stressful for the mind. My friend fell asleep in the middle of the movie and I spent the next two hours waiting for him to finally get it. A hope that died with the final credits.
