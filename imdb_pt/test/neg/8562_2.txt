The nun is a revenge image in which a very strict nun is killed by her charges of rebellious trailer trash and back years later to get even when the adults now visit her old school. The plot is predictable in spades and will not contain surprises as it progresses slowly to the end. He is a screamer for a film with acceptable acting and script and script below average. Many of the special effects are low grade and there is almost no credibility in the final battle. Still, if you look beyond these, there are some suspense and action jewelry. If you like screams of mindless cookie cutters, you'll enjoy this, otherwise you should pass.
