I rented this movie because the DVD cover made it look like it would be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. I took it to my friends house to watch the movie night. We ended up stopping 15 minutes in the movie, and watched Copper Mountain. I do not know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it's not great either. However, I would have to say that Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made a more enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> Later I finished the Puddle Cruiser. This movie was slow and the mood was forced. This movie reminded me of some stinking ones I saw in some of my first production classes in college. I was wondering "Was this the movie that allowed Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers?" Also how could this movie be so bad? Supertroopers was good and Club Dread was decent. I do not see this movie!
