Honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (as Eric Gregg) is optimistic but poor. His wife, planning Sheila Bromley (as Nona Gregg), yearns for the good things in life. Describing himself as "not burdened with tons of righteousness," Bromley begins to spend more money than Reagan wins. Bromley gets the best things in life, but puts the couple in debt. Bromley is a fun shrew. <br /> <br /> Handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as the cheerful writer Gloria Blondell (as Patricia Carmody); but he does not surrender. To pay the bills, Bromley engages in insurance fraud fraud - which helps to lay off her husband. An unemployed Reagan seems to be tempted to a life of crime - will he stand or be crooked? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents Will Happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Glory Blondell
