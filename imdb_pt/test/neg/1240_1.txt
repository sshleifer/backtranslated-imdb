Have writers paid people to come here and write positive reviews? I mean, really, it's kind of banal and Spike's not that funny. He looks more like the serious guy trying very hard to be funny. There are so many mediocre shows on this show; as once, the opening sketch was "talk show, apply directly on the forehead", repeatedly. And another one that showed Spike and another guy getting stoned, and it was not even funny. They did not even do anything but sit and laugh, over and over again. Ha Ha! And another that counted on Spike talking to a Korean guy who ate duck and said he had a pet duck. Ha ha! I mean, really, Spike just got funny guests at his show, that's why people like this show
