I can imagine why he would want to die, after starring in this garbage. The man is incredible, but even Sidney Poitier could not save this boring moral game about racism in the old west. He and Joanna Going are both fantastic in this movie: sorry that the script, the co-stars, the direction and the track do not match the two.
