I used to think "It Came from Hollywood" was the worst movie I saw that featured horror, science fiction, crime and drama clips. Of course, I had not seen this beauty yet. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with "Terror in the Aisles"? Four things: 1) It is assumed that most of the great moments in the history of shock cinema began in the 1970s, when directors like John Carpenter and Brian De Palma appeared. And what bones are thrown at real classics (like black and white films) like "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Man of the Wolves" or are shown with Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello next to it or not! 2) Clips are most often so short and out of place as their originals they only give a momentary shock to the viewer, and for those unfamiliar with these movies, they will make no sense (in fact, the that the shark leaps out of the water in Roy Scheider in "Shark" is shown very much for the effect of a viewing gag, whereas in the context of the original he had power.) 3 We do we really need Pleasance and Allen in the audience reminding us that "it's just a movie" or that most of the violence in horror films "is sadly against women"? So is this an accusation against the filmmakers for adding those scenes or moviegoers who come to theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again? Sorry, that's a can of worms to open for a more deserving movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And most importantly, why is the film so short? It's not as if this type of film is not enough to use. If they had just opened their features and used ALL the available movies, they could have had a movie of "That's Entertainment!" That would have been comparatively more fun. Heck, even dragging Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive then, remember) and, better still, even Vincent Price would have been more than willing, I bet! What a joy he would have gotten from the audience! <br /> <br /> But no ... all we have left is a little sad movie that pretends to pay tribute to these films, but all it does is let the viewer feel cheated for less than 90 minutes with the which they could have watched a REAL movie. Do not misunderstand me; It was good to see what clips they showed, but if they could have done more with the products! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea left "in the corridors".
