Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mr. Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His grumpy, patented role seems forced and even unpleasant, and not funny. The movie itself is overflowing with sly sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is gifted with numerous hard-faith references to US religious faith and patriotism that stand out as over-reverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a bad script. Edmund Gwenn plays another jovial cleric and receives nothing to do. The child protagonist is played by an untalented child who exhibits a smooth effect throughout the film. His only claim to fame as an interpreter, of course, is a low, frog-like voice, unusual for someone his age. However, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you do not need to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in most scenes of the movie. I find this child so annoying that I went forward whenever he shows up. Since he has so many scenes in this film, it means that I move quickly on much of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors; It's a shame that this movie does not have any of them. Still, Clifton Webb in the traditional wide-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.
