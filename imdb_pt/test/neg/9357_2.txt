I was very disappointed with this movie. Twice I was tempted to leave because segments of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film has elements that alludes to all the dark things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hate, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church by portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and indifferent. /> <br /> My biggest objection to this film, however, is that it is the exact opposite of a well-being film. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's Army of God was fine. Their Brigham City was very good. This film, in terms of cast, acting and drama, was his best. But in terms of being inspiring or uplifting, it was as terrible as it could be. In fact, this movie has demoralized me so much that I'm sorry for leaving. I lost interest in once again supporting Dutcher in a LDS-themed movie with a ticket purchase.
