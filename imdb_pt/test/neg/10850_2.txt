Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful and memorable music. The maestro must have rolled into her grave when this obscene farce of her work was released with her unnecessary frontal nudity and cheap copulation and her gilda portrait naive but principled as an excited idiot. The opera certainly can be adapted to the cinema - see the magnificent La Traviata by Zeferelli - but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto, it does not need cheap tricks. It might even have been acceptable if the nickname in the song had been good, but it is a mediocre interpretation of the libretto with second-rate sound quality.
