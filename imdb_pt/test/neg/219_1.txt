This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the movie itself was awful. It was so horrible that I had to search only to say how bad it was. I watched this movie and wanted to break it with every minute I watched. It could have been great. There was a big premise. If you are going to steal an armored car, and there is a homeless person who sees you, you have to do, what you have to do. For the main character deciding to kill a policeman and kill his friends and co-workers after the homeless man was already dead, it's just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers to that about how your conscience got to him, but come on. The main character crept to the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him. He blew up the stock of money and grabbed and dragged the policeman right behind the other guards and no one saw him. He managed to get back to the armored car, and nobody saw him ... This movie had potential, but it spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> You could not pay me to watch this movie ever again! Never watch! Aggravating...
