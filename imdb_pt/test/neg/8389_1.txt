This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera tilts very slowly and gradually, and then returns to the place again. The sound is raucous and, from time to time, it disappears. In another scene, the camera man is only visible in a mirror. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene with instructions on how to put up a tent ... which, believe me, lasted a long time and was completely irrelevant. to the plot. Most of the scenes dragged on with conversations that were not totally relevant as well. In my opinion, these were just to fill the movie and make it longer. Even with these added scenes was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it was the severed head, which looked quite realistic.
