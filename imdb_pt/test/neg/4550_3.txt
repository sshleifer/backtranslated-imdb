If you like soap series, you may like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch soap series like GTST, Westenwind or even American things like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you do not like it: stay away from this movie. It has the same type of visual style, the same acting quality, direction and writing. The film was a great success in national territory, but was not sold anywhere else outside the Netherlands and Belgium. Too weird for a commercial movie like this. <br /> <br /> Maybe say something ...
