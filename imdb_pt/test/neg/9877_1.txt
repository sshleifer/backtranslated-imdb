I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First, it is from the point of view of someone who sees the movie and never reads (and can never read) the book. The second is from someone who has. <br /> <br /> (Film without a book) From the film's point of view, it was a cool movie. Nowhere as good as any of the underworld, but far better than the ultraviolet. And I'm not just talking about plot as well. The visual effects were dubious in many of the parts, although the transformation of the wolf was very good. The characters have very little development and Vivian did not seem to really care about the fact that her "love" was killing what was left of her kind. Some of the other characters might have had more time in the air, like The Five. The plot was very similar to the underworld for my taste. <br /> <br /> (film with book) As many have already stated, in addition to the title, character names and a few smaller parts, the film and the book are nothing alike. In the film, Gabriel was much older and was the father of Rafe (so Astrid was his companion). In the book, Gab was about 24 years old, never involved with anyone since the wolves marry forever (Astrid is trying to gain his affection) and Astrid was Ulf's mother, not Rafe's. Another important thing is the location. The book was held in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The film has been Vivian's fault and her entire family was killed because of this. In the book, the original leader of the Five, named Axel, killed a girl from his school. Hunters tracked the wolves and killed many of them (including Viv's father), forcing them to move. In addition, Viv's mother, Esme, was an important character. <br /> <br /> One thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the "bitch dance". For those of you who do not know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) struggle to see who is the only one to be the companion of the new leader (since there was a fight for the males before). Vivian won, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrible woman of evil in the book) and therefore should mate with Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you've read the book and liked the book, I suggest you DO NOT watch this movie.
