There at the dawn of human civilization, cavemen sat around and made idiotic jokes, beating each other in the heads with whatever they could grab, and the women were never seen and apparently at the same time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region, with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no woman. This film tells of the "hilarious" misadventures of seven (or more) cavemen - having burned their lands with the new discovery of the fire - moving through the water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendix. Along the way, we have "great" comedy moments, like a fat cave man swallowing a frog that continues to croak in his stomach. A monkey throwing stones at their heads. A man swallowing a rat to catch the frog in the stomach. The "gay" cave man required. The list could go on and on. This film is the very definition of cinematic dreck. I was bored from the start and only got worse when the cavemen started pounding on each other, making bad jokes like puns on the word perch, hitting each other, and damaging the poor arrow Berger who seems to have lost a bet for one producer. to appear in this absurdity. It is indeed one of the two bright spots of this film. She's not much of an actress, so you have to guess why she's an idiot? The other "bright" point is music. As soon as I heard the score, I told myself it sounded very familiar. I had never heard the score, but the music was unmistakably that of Ennio Morricone. It is a good result and the best thing in a gross, boring, obscene, unimaginative and ridiculous movie, essentially about a group of Moes meeting a woman for the first time and first wanting to eat her like an animal, learning what she could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I'm choking yawn as I relive the plot! The end of the film has about 100 women most of the time naked on the screen with all the erotic feel of taking off a shell of the knee. This movie was painful to sit in and offers no real merit whatsoever. The fact of having generated a sequel does not surprise me, because it offers something that will annoy the interest of the viewer.
