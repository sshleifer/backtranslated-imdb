Ever watched something so horrible that you just have to keep watching to make sure it's as bad as it sounds? This is one of those movies. It was criticized by the critics for the launch, not at least by the way in which it was financed. I got on the TV last night and relinquished my curiosity. <br /> <br /> In the event, it says in the box, no more and no less: low-level humor, rawness, much in the Straight forward ... vein, but with "adult" language. In fact, that goes back to the British porn industry of the 60s / 70s, fooling gamblers by promising real sex rather than indulging (see nipple?) The whole bad taste season has been lovingly recreated here, but with modern cinematography. <br /> <br /> It has the benefit of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and more) and also Johnny Vegas. The girl at the chip shop is genuinely sexy. Apart from these unexpected aspects, it makes me wonder what happened to England. Junk food, underpaid work, council properties, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some good pictures of Birmingham lined. Foreigners may find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations. On the whole, however, I still feel disbelief at having been through it.
