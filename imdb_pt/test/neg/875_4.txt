I had high hopes for this movie, although I did not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - must be good already. But the film does not keep the promise. I was waiting for more depth to the characters and there was not. I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love. This can happen. But we never know the characters. I wish I had more focus on them. The movie reminded me of places in Bridges of Madison County, and this movie was a lot better. I really felt the characters in the movie, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there was between Gere and Lane. Each of them is a good actor in his own right. It just is not the right movie for them together.
