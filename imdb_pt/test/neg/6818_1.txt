Completely ridiculous movie making fun of the college admissions process. While it is true that the SAT is not all in a student's assessment for admission to college, what the film says is absolutely ridiculous and not worth repeating or seeing. <br /> <br /> College admissions staff are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely close view of the whole process. The film is an insult to high school students who work hard and then go through a long process until they receive the letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools for which they applied. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves rejection on all levels.
