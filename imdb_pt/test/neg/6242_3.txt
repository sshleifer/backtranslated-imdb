Now I know why this movie can be bought for so cheap in video stores. I was curious, since it had three stars of reputation, but was among the films of 'B' that the video apparently does not give! The answer is, it's a movie that would appeal to a very limited audience: a crowd over 50 with very liberal sensibilities. <br /> <br /> Who else watches Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren essentially give a basic message that "cheating on your wife is fine as long as you still love her". That's the good message of "feeling good" here, particularly at the end, at the end of this strange kidnapping story. Who wrote this script ..... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "strange" because the hijacker is the prettiest hijacker (Dafoe) you've ever seen, except in the end. He often unleashes his hostage (Redford), whom no kidnapper will risk, has informal conversations about family affairs, etc. It's all ridiculous! Well, L.A. Times says it's "an intelligent thriller." Ha ha Well this confirms what most people know about L.A. Times. For those of you who believe in this and have not seen it, I will not spoil it with more gigantic holes in this story, particularly in the end. The fact is that it is an insult to anyone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> Either way, you can not fool all people all the time, as critics have yet to find out. Here's another movie that they praised that they rightfully bombarded the box office and the video store.
