Deanna Troi naked! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother Chuck (from "Happy Days") with a Reverse Mohican! Death Wish 3 has it all and more, including an intelligent scene in which Chuck Bronson's character mounts a mousetrap that looks like a punk when he opens the window. Chuck also puts a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he comes back and sees bloody footprints pulling away. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it's one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've ever seen - carried to the limit with chaos, and almost zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to cut the punks down by punctuation. <br /> <br /> From what I understand, Bronson disowned this movie, but fortunately discounted the Golan Globus check. <br /> <br /> If you like quality movies, skip this one, but if you're into a kind of "Jackass" emotion cheap, check it out.
