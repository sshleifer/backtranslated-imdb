* This comment may technically contain "spoilers", but certainly contains no surprises * My cousin and I rented it the other day hoping to have a good laugh from a typical shit excuse to a horror movie . Unfortunately, we did not have a lot of laughs, and we certainly did not have many scares too. Plot Outline: An airplane containing a business-headed daughter and some strange piece of technology falls into one. In the area where our furry friend lives, the head of the company assembles a team of personalities instead of skilled hunters, to recover it. <br /> <br /> In the first 3/4 of the movie, things get pretty boring. It consists mostly of photos of Big Foot lurking in the trees, with staff members occasionally listening to it and passing it as nothing. We also see various scenes of the party from Big Foot's point of view, and he apparently sees in the thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To set the storyline, we have to watch the sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the existence and actions of sasquatches. "Maybe he can deflect bullets ... if he sees them." Surely, later we see that he can. "There are many unexplored lands on which sasquatch can live. Perhaps this is one that has been neglected." And obviously it is. "Maybe Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members." And sure enough, that's the case. Along with these scenes, there are a couple of "Oh my god is the sasquatch oh wait it's just you!" scenes, and, unfortunately, they are among the scariest. <br /> <br /> So, finally, people start dying. Well, at least 2 people. In addition, the bodies of the victims of the past are discovered. The death scenes are very bad. Most of the time it just leaves our imagination, showing the Sasquatch grabbing them, then cutting to a different scene, but first, we're treated to some horrible screams off the camera. <br /> <br /> So, finally, we come to see the protagonist's final confrontation with the monster. I have to admit, I found it very exciting while it lasted. But, unfortunately, it is very short, and then we are treated with an ending that makes a half effort to seem puzzling. So some final text with a rather annoying conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I recommend this movie. Not too bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and definitely not scary enough and annoying to enjoy as a horror movie. Just do not bother with that.
