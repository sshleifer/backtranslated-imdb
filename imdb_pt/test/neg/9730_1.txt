When I saw on the voting board that some people gave this movie a score of 10, I assumed they did not know that the score was not at 100. This is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term. Badly written and weakly directed with actors called incapable of acting, but able to grimace when ordered. In the first 60 minutes, the story seems to be going in one direction, then it changes course and engages in a power struggle with extremely bad special effects. Unable to figure out a clever way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with superpowers, the "writer" cheats. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story line because it was easier than making an acceptable outcome. Not that the writing knows the word "end". Some movies go directly to the DVD. This should have gone straight to the dustbin.
