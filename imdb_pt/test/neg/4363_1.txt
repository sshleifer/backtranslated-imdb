<br /> <br /> This movie sucks! The first one was much better. No one from the first returned in this stupid sequel and somehow that's a good thing because of poor performance, but the characters in this movie are not even better. Killjoy in the forest? Let's go! Give me some time! I'm surprised Killjoy's friend Blair Witch did not show up to make a tip. Bad acting, bad story and just plain silly and boring. Do not waste your time!
