Brian? What the hell were you doing when you signed up to do this? I saw it recently at a festival, and was greeted by howling laughter everywhere. As the credits rolled, tears streamed down the faces of many in the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is an awkward combination of 'E.R.' and 'X-File'; how cynically turned to the TV audience, how can it get unprocessed. The sequences involving the abductions are hilarious - both Yuzna's staging of the "bed floatation" and Mad Pat's shrieking plastic aliens attracted laughter of disbelief and scorn. <br /> <br /> Limp, camping and stupid. My only hope was that it was a freak - As terrible as "The Return of the Living Dead" was good. <br /> <br /> Steev
