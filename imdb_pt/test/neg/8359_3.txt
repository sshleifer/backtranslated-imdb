There must have been a lot of background information that was left out of the film. In fact, in the movie, the girl, Lizzy, did not even seem depressed. She looked like a girl who got out of control when she finally got to college, mostly for drugs and drinking alcohol. This seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Of course, she had emotional problems because her father left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mother looked a little out there. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just mean and I do not think it was caused by depression. She was much needed, which pushed Rafe away, but she was so because of her father. <br /> <br /> But, I think the main reason for this movie never having been released in the theater is that it does not happen enough with the plot. and the story is not well written. VERDICT FINAL: Honestly, I would only recommend this if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first nudity scene. Otherwise, it's not very interesting.
