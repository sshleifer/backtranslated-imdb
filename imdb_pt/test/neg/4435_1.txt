Legend has it that at the Hollywood gala premiere in 2001: A Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes into the movie Rock Hudson shouted, "Could anyone tell me what the hell this movie is about?" Well, I got Rock Beaten for about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. This movie made absolutely no sense. Who were these people? Where were these people? What were the rules of the game called Quintet? Are there rules for Quintet? Robert Altman and his comrades were making the movie while they continued? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed it? Maybe old Fast Eddie saw Zardoz and thought, "Well, if Connery can get involved in a futuristic movie that does not make sense, so can I." Maybe the good thing is on the cutting room floor and all we can see is the incoherent material. Also, did the entire cast manage to keep their hats funny? You have never seen these bizarre hats in one place in your life. Quintet only confirms what I always thought: when Altman is good he is superb, but when he is bad, he does things like Quintet
