This movie is just crap. I have to say that I am an expert on junk films. I reserve the "1" rating for movies that are rubbish but funny, but this movie is simply tedious and certainly not bad in a funny way, but a crap in a bad way. Get a "2" so that those of you out there can distinguish between those who will make you laugh and those who will make you fall asleep. There are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something, their expressions are astonishing and there wide eyes and loose jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly incredible, this is simply not just a closet or even more deserted . It has to be very horrible for me to leave, let me tell you, I left and some people too.
