The best thing about this movie is that it looks like they used a lot of things left over from the attack on Pearl Harbor on Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the P-40 shot crashing into the P-40 queue parked but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it only gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> There are two black guys and two white men as American prisoners of war, as well as some Filipino prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The Americans POW ranking is a white naval lieutenant, who is of course an O-3 in the Navy. Anyway, he's in need of a haircut, evil, distractedly wrong. Hockey hair does not belong to a WWII movie. Oh, and he's a racist. He does not want to share rooms with the "blacks." Of course in real life, he would not want to share rooms with the white guy listed as well. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause on officers' quarters and enlisted, but that was not the point here. Well, I think the plot is secondary to other problems in this movie. He is put in his place and practically passes the rest of the film as a glance and running the air pump to the divers. <br /> <br /> But once you're going, it's not a bad story. The holes want divers to lift the silver thrown by the Americans before Corrigador falls. Philippine resistance wants them to take their time. And prisoners of war do their best to help. A potentially good story and not so badly made, I think. A little unbelievable when the prisoners use camp re-respirators to swim between the POW camp and the Filipino village every night. Maybe I'm not so picky when I know it's not a very successful movie. I think that's why it comes in a DVD war movie collection of 20 packs for five dollars. <br /> <br /> 70's music does not belong to this movie or any WWII movie. It's very disturbing to say the least. The acting was not so bad. Probably better than I could do. Not being a football fan, at least I discovered that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone that Richard Pryor invented. That in itself was worth what I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching at TCM or paying a room for. <br /> <br /> One star for being a war movie, another for being World War II and one more because I feel generous.
