Everything about this show is terrible. His premise even prepares to get cheap laughs with poor writing. A "dysfunctional family" - the theme has been used many times, especially by the Simpsons, which is an excellent show with great writing and lots of laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of history in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in. Now, if this was original or funny, sure, I think it was clever. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason the episodes are so is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly extract episode after episode of that junk. Much of this show is not original, and what is original is just lame. He's also incredibly rude and irreverent, which can be good if he's still smart. The animation is not everything, but from an artistic point of view, this show also fails, proving once again that the Family Guy seeks as much as possible cheap jokes and easy shortcuts. People like this show, and I do not really care, because people can enjoy whatever they want, no matter how much they crave the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend this, especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer. This is a cheap entertainment that aims low and found success in it. The fact that this is so successful says bad things about America.
