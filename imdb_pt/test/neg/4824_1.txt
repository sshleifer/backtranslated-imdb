This soap is worse than bad: it is poisonous. Of the many television programs that have had a corrosive influence on British society in the last twenty years, Eastenders is the prime example. For two decades this show celebrated the imbecile, the thug, the street kid, the pie, the gobby, the violent, the sexually incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ... <br /> <br /> How many times has anyone or anyone observed that Eastenders "mirror life"? Life on what planet, exactly? <br /> <br /> It's written about "working class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who took a course in creative writing. Looking forward to showing their middle class colleagues how familiar they are with the "working class", they dream about the lumpen mob that is the citizenship of the Eastenders. <br /> <br /> This has a toxic effect on some minds less well equipped than others to deal with fiction, and so we find members of the royal population taking on the attitudes and behavior of the inhabitants of Walford. <br /> <br /> So it came about that supporters mirrored life; but only after life has been duped to mirror the Eastenders. <br /> <br /> Other soaps followed in the footsteps of EE, filled with their fetid villains with ugly, potato-faced characters, scrawny, bulging heads, furrowing their eyebrows. to each other and issuing threats constantly. This is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this garbage. The writers will enrich with the product of such production and will continue to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarefied enclaves. Meanwhile, the growing number of new, TV-induced drones will inexorably move toward cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> And there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the beginning of the 21st century. Much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that lit box of dancing pixels in the corner of your living room. It is your fault, gentle reader: it is what you choose as the only window by which to look from your prison.
