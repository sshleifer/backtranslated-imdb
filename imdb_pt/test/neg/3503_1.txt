I'm amazed that anyone likes this movie. I never leave movies, but my friend had to physically prevent me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. the white characters are holy and the Asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless for history. they exist only as objects, surprise. characters from other races do much better. the twists and turns were laughable and predictable. but if you're reading this, you already know that. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can not even make multicultural films. do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest approach to race relations, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!
