Significant spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick and disturbing movie ... as well as the unhealthy and clumsy director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote. I do not even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It's not the actors' fault, for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. This is how this film was written and the way the characters were written, which was the reference of a truly sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I will never watch another movie that has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sickly, twisted, foul-mouthed and moody deviant. She looks, talks, and sounds like a biker girl with her brain fried with drugs, who spent 20 years doing so much time. You can clearly see what kind of person she is watching her in the DVD special features section of "Watch: The Watchers Are Watching". You can see and hear it yourself. It was as bad as I had anticipated in the production of this film. <br /> <br /> I'm not shocked by bad language, though this director certainly speaks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any movie p0rn. The level of sado-violence and implicit perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre that is even illegal by p0rn standards. This perverse and disturbing thought is clearly apparent in her personality and in the things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. This is a snuff film. <br /> <br /> Be sure to hear your narration about the deleted scenes and the alternate ending. This director / writer is truly a sick person. I can not believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, let alone pay it for it. You can be sure that I will never watch another movie she has affiliated with. In the thousands of movies I watched and collected, there are only a few directors and writers who deserve this type of boycott. She's offensive beyond anyone I've ever seen before filming a movie. There were some bad directors and writers, but none of them compare to your sick and distorted mind. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, that was just one murder after another. Once they went through the murder of the hotel ... then the sick cops firing and brutalizing the drivers by kicks ... the holiday family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children) ... followed by drug addicts .... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers. <br /> <br /> As I saw the serial killers reveal themselves, I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. Those were my real thoughts while watching this movie. I fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind ... because this writer needs to be seriously committed to long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, he ended up being the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized that my assessment of the writer was right in the nose. On the DVD, she was in fact the sick and distorted person I imagined writing such a disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> While the little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins actually stole the show ... I can 'I believe your real life parents would have tolerated this sickly and dirtiest director anywhere near of your daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is disturbing, sickly, offensive, distorted, and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental setting. <br /> <br /> As for the film's ending, the alternative ending should have been the result of this terrible ordeal. There was no sense or benefit to the movie, the story, or the flow of the movie through the death of the other character. I'm shocked that any studio actually distributed the film. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the film attracted the audience was due to the intelligent and creative representation of the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you will see. <br /> <br /> In addition to the child ... every character in this movie was a crazy, murderous, perverted, perverse, violent and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you watch carefully, even the parents of the family on vacation; sick cops taking shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; police at the station; and even the station dispatcher ... each of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted, distorted, and violent pervert. I'm not quite sure about some of the actors after seeing them talk about the filming of the movie and the Canadian city in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> This writer-director has such a personal history. mental deviation that regardless of what she writes, every character role contains the same carbon copy stamps. The only character who did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Watch closely and you will see this in all characters. Then listen to the writer-director's talk in the DVD Special Features section and you'll understand what I'm talking about about your mental state and psychological issues. She would not be tolerated in many decent homes if she were not from a family of Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much of a filmography-less than a handful of things. Since she copies these disturbing traits in all her roles, I do not think we'll have to see a lot of movies written or directed by her unless her father, director David Lynch, helps her. I would recommend staying away from any movie she was involved with ... and I'm not sure if her father's movies would be any better. Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
