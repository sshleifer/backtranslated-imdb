This is what I kept asking myself during the many fights, games of shouting, swearing and general chaos that permeate the 84 minutes. Comparisons also arise when you think of one-dimensional characters that have so little depth that it's almost impossible to care what happens to them. They are just poorly written figures for the director to hang on to his multicultural beliefs, a topic that has been much better in other dramas on both TV and in the movies. I must confess, I'm not really one to spot bad performances during a movie, but it should be said that Nichola Burley (as heroine's best friend) and Wasim Zakir (as nasty brother and bullying) were absolutely terrible. I do not know which acting school they graduated from, but if I were I would apply for a full refund. Only Samina Awan in the lead role can impress in a cast of so-called British talent that we will probably never hear again. At least, that is hope. Next time, hire a different batter. <br /> <br /> Another intriguing thought is the horribly stylish soundtrack with names like Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now I'm a bit of a fan of music and I'm familiar with most of these artists, but I did not recognize any of the tracks during this movie (besides the ubiquitous "Run"). B-sides, anyone? We have received many musical montages that show how we should feel. These are accompanied by amazingly original images such as couples kissing on a swollen lake and kissing on doors. That's a problem, since none of the music conveys the mood efficiently, and we realize that the director does not have the ability to take the emotional journey to the audience through narrative and dialogue alone. <br /> <br /> The ending is presumably to be just desserts, as everyone gets their punishment and there is at least one big shock in the store .. But I remained resolutely indifferent because the script had not given me anyone to cheer. It is not enough to deal with a hot key problem, you have to give us a plan that has not been done to the death and people who are more than a facade. As it stands, this movie is a noble failure, with only the promising main actress and some lightly amusing punch-ups to save it from the bin. 4/10 You should try more ..
