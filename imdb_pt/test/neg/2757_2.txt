This could have been a lot better than what happened. Tom Pittman does a good job and some of the older actors get along well with what they have to work with, but that just does not work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are too old to play in high school. students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). He looks thirty years old. Second, it's hard to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty is not that hot to begin with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The ending is so strange. . It seems that the director intended that Pittman's character be shot, but there are no shots ... he just hit the cement, where he stays there until the ambulance drivers look for him and put him on a stretcher! . What were his injuries? A skinned knee? Goofy! Vince has just killed his girlfriend without any remorse, but he simply pushes Marv to the ground and runs off despite the fact that he does not make a secret of the fact that he hates the boy. And to make things even more silly, Marv begs the police to tell his father he's sorry. I think you'll have plenty of opportunity to tell your father you're sorry ... personally. And this writer did not get an Oscar nomination? Skip, unless you can watch the MST.
