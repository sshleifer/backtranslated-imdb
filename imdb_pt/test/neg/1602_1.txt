I thought the film was interesting and exciting to watch, until the last episode, when nothing happens, its Americans portray Muslims as terrorists, and Americans as heroes, it's the opposite. I hate it when every American TV show is predictable, I I was hoping the bombs would explode in that stadium, but I knew this would not happen, you need to have the joy of watching when you know that the good guys are going to save the day, again, the Americans are the biggest terrorists, the leader of them all, he's to blame for September 11, and I'm the guy you keep playing those shows on us, which are all f ****** same! I have a good program on terrorism, is called "The Whitehorse" and involves the leader of the cell, is the same with 24, as always 24 was good, the sleeping cell is a farce and should never make a season 2, it is F * **** joke! and you are American producers.
