I bought Jack-O a few months ago on a Blockbuster video sale, and at the time I was not expecting anything extraordinary from that. As I watched it, I realized that I received not only less than I could have negotiated, but also much more. It seems strange, I know. And this is it. But it's perfectly appropriate when you consider the total strangeness that is "Jack-O". <br /> <br /> The film follows a boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, through ancestral ties, he is marked for death at the hands of a demented pumpkin man, holding the sickle. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's great-uncle, cousin uncle, and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his mission of revenge from hell. Anyway, a lot of "horror" happens when Jack-O makes his way through several neighbors before fighting Shawn to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who can find any value in this movie. I can honestly say that Jack-O is one of the worst-made movies in the history of time. The acting is unimpressive (except when it should be), the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget should not have exceeded $ 150. Some of the more risible death scenes are performed in this anti-thriller, and are even funnier when you realize that director Steve Latshaw really seems to be serious in his production of movies. <br /> <br /> And still I like the movie a lot. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say that I had a lot of fun watching my friends and watched several times since that fateful first show. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this film intolerable and unnecessarily time-consuming, and this is understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously, you'll see Jack-O as an instant classic, which is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so hard to evaluate this movie. If I evaluated the quality of the film as Jack-O's film, I would not give anything away. Actually, the studio owed me stars. However, if I was evaluating it is based on pure pleasure, I would give an 8 or a 9. I will give a 4, so be somewhere in the middle. I recommend that everyone leave, rent it and make their own conclusion.
