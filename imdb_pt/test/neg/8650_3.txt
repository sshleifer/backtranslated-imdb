This film is very modern and advanced. It is about 75% in English. It is intended for English-speaking young people who speak in public. The basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Performance is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately they are portraying a wrong image and setting a bad example for young people. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking doses of tequila about 5-6 times in the film. The director does not even acknowledge that she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. Throughout the movie she only wears bikini tops if she is at work, on a beach or at a wedding. The heroine of the movie doing this makes the young people feel that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The less talk about Uday Chopra's failure to make the arrogant Shahrukh Khan's DDJD role, the better. The film is about gender equality. But equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead of doing the right thing to do the right thing. If men were shown as chronic Casanovas in the movies, it does not mean that women should also portray the same behavior. <br /> <br /> Although the film is made with a cheerful and carefree spirit, it promotes so many misunderstood social notions the name of being ahead, that "fun" part of the film does not make any impact. Not even in Canada do women dress like that, or the guys behave like they showed in the movie. It is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even Canadian society. Maybe they should have a warning at the beginning stating, "All the characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." The only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hours, thank god.
