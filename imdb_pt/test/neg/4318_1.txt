OK, I went to this site before watching this movie, read the reviews, being pumped because they were all too good for a moving movie and watched it and I was completely disappointed. The main characters who want to be the solitary rebels straight from the midwest act were sick to the stomach, and they did not even tell me about the two policemen, I mean there's a bloody door right in sight, check it out! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was fairly limited, I swear the publisher was napping near the end when he was cutting out this film, and the direction was obscured by a bad cinematography. Now, please do not get me wrong, I love B movies, some are really good. <br /> <br /> I want to watch a good movie B? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> "High Tension" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
