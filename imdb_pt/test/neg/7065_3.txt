This film begins with interesting scenography and a promising premise, but does not provide the cult film products. Set in a brave parallel universe, where everything is owned by the "Blump" Corporation, it is a horrible standing comic that finds success when it takes a third arm off its back. <br /> <br /> All Potential For the excellent cheese is here - Judd Nelson, the 80s star, Wayne Newton, strange visuals and strange digressions, obese women wearing lingerie, necrophilia - but that never pays. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is the main problem. Each scene is excruciatingly slow. Nelson's stand-up routines should be funny because they are not pathetically funny. But each performance drags on until it's not even tangentially funny, just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone telling you the longest and most strange joke imaginable, full of self-congratulations on how funny and strange he thinks he is. Imagine after two hours ruining it, you never got a joke. You've just saved yourself the trouble of watching The Dark Backward.
