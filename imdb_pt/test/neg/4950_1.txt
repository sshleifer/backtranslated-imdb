I do not know why this has gotten decent reviews, as it could be the weaker horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is just for a special turnout and his performance is as unnecessary as most useless attempts at jokes (and scares). The direction is terrible and the acting is worse. It seems that every year the producers are trying to make another Evil Dead, but these weak, non-original attempts are just stepping into the memory of a true horror classic. <br /> <br /> If your filmmakers say, "This is not a remake." but it's a setback from the 80s (which is so little original in my opinion - Hatchet) or people trying to connect it to other horror classics, it's still misleading and will not make up for the lack of scares, horror, comedy or even a movie decent for that matter. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL THE COSTS !!!
