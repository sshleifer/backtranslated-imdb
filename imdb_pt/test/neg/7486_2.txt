I had chosen this time and again at the rental store, wondering if I should give it a chance. Today I collapsed and turned around, and probably should not. <br /> <br /> Although the writer / director gave the film a respectable effort, it fell far short of engagement. The characters, as long as you wanted to feel for them, simply were not deep enough or deep enough for you to really get involved with them. Sara's sexual outbursts became tiresome - fast. I do not care about sex in movies, and I do not care about malicious characters, but being a "bad girl" does not mean you're prone to randomly asking people if they would like sexual favors. By the time what happened to the characters was revealed, I was bored and ready to move on to the climax, the finale, anything exciting ... and nothing delivered. The things the people in the story eventually told him seem forced and unrealistic, and simply were not interpreted correctly. If they had thrown a little more angst there, I might be interested. This should have been more of a thriller / drama, and should have been titled "Jon Good's wife" instead of the whole "red right hand" and horror film cover. Hell ... this should have suspense, period. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... watch this on a rainy day or late at night, when there's nothing on television. Although this is not as good as I expected, I would do this with some infomercials.
