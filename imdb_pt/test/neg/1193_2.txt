I'm a big LoG fan. I thought the first two series provided some of the best comedies this country has ever seen and the third series, though different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The thought of seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen made July 3 something to look forward to. However, somewhere, everything went very wrong. The writers had no real history or ideas. The part in ancient England showed the glimpses of the genius that we know the league is capable of, but these scenes do not fit well with the film. Geoff provided the best of very few, mostly poor, jokes and performances of Lipp and Briss were big disappointments. If you love the League, save time and money and watch episodes of the TV series again. And again. A huge disappointment.
