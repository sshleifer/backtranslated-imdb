this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason I gave a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a "is this real ??" kind of way. it was so extravagant and low budget ... they should not even have bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure to have nudity and violence, and the effects were so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup like blood and cabbage on severed heads). do not rent it !!
