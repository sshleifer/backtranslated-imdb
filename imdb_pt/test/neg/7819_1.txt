Ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? Well, look no further! This movie has it all! <br /> <br /> Jokes about racism, jokes about shortcomings, jokes about being overweight, jokes about suicide, jokes about murder, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, jokes about dirt, jokes about jokes between old and new old jokes about cancer, gay jokes and face jokes on the face several times, excessive use of blood jokes, rape jokes, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, abnormal jokes, a lot of people making coffee jokes , nudity jokes, see who can say more profanity in a scene, jokes, jokes about lesbians, jokes about girlfriend abuse, and the list goes on in people! <br /> <br /> The worst part is: none of this is funny! (Not that anyone finds most of these funny to begin with.) It seems that when there's nothing worse, it pushes your expectations to a new bottom, since it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. There was a scene that almost made me vomit and almost completely depressed at the same time. I do not think I need to point out which, but again, I'm sure there are other scenes that will give people that same feeling. <br /> <br /> There was a moment at the end of the movie. film that really made sense and was a little realistic when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled with the most unpleasant remains of a garbage bag and thrown several meters on the floor just to have a lot of bottles of beer smashed in your head. All this probably when he least deserved it. Then every thought of redemption from one more point was quickly considered. This is really a terrible movie. This is one that needs to be studied and divided into small parts in a film school to teach students what not to do.
