I love this show. I watched all the episodes last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune in to watch tonight and see for some reason that you remade this great show. And you took what went right and ruined everything. You took one of the best aspects of the show, which were the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love the other characters too but they are good at little fools like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's as if the show had lost part of his family and everyone was trying hard to fill. It's an overdose. While things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time goes from funny to annoying. I was so looking forward to the return of this show. So, please, bring back the charm. Even if you could not fit Piper into the show, at least bring Lizzy back. But I loved those girls. They brought the fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his business life and deal with his personal life and friends as well. That was the charm. And that great dog too. <br /> <br /> I hope the network (FOX) has forced writers to do this and the writers have not willingly done it for the program. I'm going to give the show a few more episodes before I give up, but today's episodes have been bad. I did a great show thing coming back tonight and had people and I felt like a fool because no one was laughing except 2-3 times. I apologized to them and said I do not know what happened. And about 10 minutes into the episode I realized they were not going to show Piper or Lizzy and this was no longer a must see TV comedy.
