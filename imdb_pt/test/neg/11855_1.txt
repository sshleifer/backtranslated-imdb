The only reason there is a question mark in parentheses is NO because I have not seen all the movies released in 2001 so far. It is because this film was only made PARTIALLY in 2001. The rest was stolen from the other dinosaur films of Roger Corman, Carnosaur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession to make. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite movies B. He borrows heavily from James Cameron's "Aliens," is not even funny. But I love it. I can not explain exactly why. It just works for me. I liked the sets, I liked the cinematography, I liked how they borrowed from "Aliens". It's all a bit ironic that Cameron at one point was a replacement for Corman, with films like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I own the Carnosaur trilogy on DVD, and the most that I can say, for the first part is that it has moments. The most I can say to the third is that it took me five years to find him watchable. <br /> <br /> Now we have "Raptor", which does NOT continue in this series. Instead, he lends ENTIRE scenes to the Carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around him. And somehow, Roger Corman got Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do it. Now, I'm not saying that Roberts or Bernsen are at any level of careers. But both were at one point what could be called RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Of course, actors react to the effects they do not even see while filming all the time. Here, however, they are reacting to incompatible images of movies that are between five and eight years old. There is even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in "Carnosaur 1". Apparently, it made a lot of sense to have the original guy back. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said they would use the old dinosaur models of "Carnosaur." Apparently, Corman decided after this interview that he would not even do that. And it's not that he could not find an FX team to do that. The script for this was clearly written, keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre-existing films. <br /> <br /> Do not compare this with Ed Wood. Ed did better than that. At least he only used Bela's footage once, in a movie. There are ways to incorporate stock footage into a movie, and "Raptor" takes this deprecated technique to a new level. Even if you liked "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species", stay away from "Raptor".
