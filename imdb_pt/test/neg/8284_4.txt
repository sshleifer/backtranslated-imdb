After his famous cross-country runner dies after a run, members of an athletic team are hunted down and killed by a mysterious masked assassin seeking revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of this film, it was obvious that it would not be very good (at least as far as true quality is concerned). The 'dramatic' runway run at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least credible sports events I've ever seen in a movie. It seems that the winner of the race had never raced before in his entire life. Do not just run. . . but run everything. Ever. From there, we received a horribly unrealistic female Navy member who was breaking various rules of appearance with her jewelry and makeup, not to mention the fact that her hair was loose on her collar while she was in uniform. Ridiculously clumsy camera angles, blood-sucking pathetically rendered, and acting that range from startlingly over-the-top to boring (all in one actor, you see) all help make this movie one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films of all time times. On the other hand, the writing was not so terrible and the story was really good. But the direction was horrible, made worse by the offensively bad cinematography. The performance varied from acceptable to simply abysmal. Regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, however, there is something here, be it cheese or something I can not understand, which makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. Maybe it was just Vanna White. Slasher Elements Required: <br /> <br /> Violence / Gore: Scenes of death were fun enough, but the blood was horrible: blood gushes from impossible angles, there are no real cuts or wounds of knives, etc. But, this movie has the first 'death by football' scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Sex / Nudity: There was a bit of nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley is in her, after all), and some high school students overly excited but nothing to much. <br /> <br /> Cool Killer (s): If you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits and fencing masks are cool, this is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: It's really nothing. There is a moment that happens in the girls' locker room that I was preparing to be afraid of. . . but, this only led to a typical stupidity and was ruined by me. Mystery: A little, but if you can not figure out the identity of the killer about 20 minutes from the movie, then I'm not too sure about your deduction power. <br /> <br /> - embarrassing dance scene: There is a great jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and harmonica that leads to incredible 80s bopping. This is soon followed by some sort of weird 1970s mix of disco and break dance of the 80s that was probably the scariest part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Do not take it too seriously and you may like it (as well as everything else that Troma plays). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
