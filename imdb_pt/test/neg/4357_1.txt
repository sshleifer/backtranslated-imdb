Killjoy 2 beats the first movie for just a little bit. The material that improved here was Killjoy's performance, makeup and history. This is one more blood feast, it has no supernatural elements like the first. In this issue, Killjoy kills his victims more normally, he throws them into the fire, and he does not shoot them with bullets that were in his mouth. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that the ending was kinda stupid, actually it was kinda stupid, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies. Seriously, the first movie was good, but the second is better. 10
