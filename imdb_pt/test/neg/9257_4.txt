This film was released in the UK under the name of Blood Rites. He was banished immediately and never introduced himself to be released. <br /> <br /> Like the Ghastly Ones, it was supposed to be a hit among the terror-hungry inhabitants of the famous 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit in New York. If you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, to see development disabled Colin (Hal Borske) thigh down on a live rabbit, you have to put up with a 16 mm camera job that makes Ed Wood look positively wonderful. <br /> <br /> Three sisters are to spend three days in the family home with their husbands before the old man's money is disbursed. Of course, in such a situation, people begin to fall dead. The secrets of the family are exposed and much blood is shed, especially during a terrible breakup. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the rabbit that the Brits did, I know.
