Sorry I could not disagree more with the last comments. frankly I thought this was worse than continuing in Columbus, enough said. The last film for the normally brilliant Charles Hartrey, who seemed out of the way when humor moved to the Highly Fun level of the buses, whose films were made at the same time, was frankly funnier. Barbera Windsor was embarrassing, a character as one of her mothers Flirty friends who still thinks she is eighteen, on vacation with some entity not from a Scotsman, Rab c Nesbit he is not. The series miraculously followed with duffers like Carry On Behind and Carry on England. Continue Dick was not bad, but really with this movie the end of the series was near, a shame because until this movie I can not think of bad movie before that?
