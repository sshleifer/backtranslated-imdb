Antonio Margheriti, director of the fun horror cult Cannibal Apocalypse, directs this gothic-looking giallo starring Jane Birkin (as well as his French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg). <br /> <Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of goodies as a teacher of tasty bisexual French and a terrifyingly unrealistic killer orangutan, Seven Deaths of the Cat's Eye ends a dark mess that is a struggle to bear. Pretty schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to the Scottish property of her family after many years away, only to find out that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one. Using the full range of tricks from the "creepy old house" (hidden doors, dark corridors, scary cemeteries, candlelit cobweb rooms), Margheriti gathers a confusing storyline that sometimes promises supernatural events, but ends with a lame cop. To end it is unimaginative in the extreme. <br /> <br /> 'And where exactly does the cat fit into all this?', I hear you ask. Well, a rather stocky moggy witnesses each murder, thus justifying the rather cool sound title of Margheriti. <br /> <br /> 'Gory, stylish fun' claims the cover of the DVD; 'Flat pile of manure' says I.
