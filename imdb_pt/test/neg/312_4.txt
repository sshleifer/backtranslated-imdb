At Halloween, a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a large pumpkin by a head. Bad acts committed primarily with local talents and laughable special effects make this a baaaaad. B-Movie Queen Linnea Quigley seems embarrassed to be a part of this and even by her considerable charm that has helped many of her other films not be able to help. Pass this cheese movie if you're looking for a good Halloween horror movie and rent "Night of the Demons," which is also starring Ms. Quigley.
