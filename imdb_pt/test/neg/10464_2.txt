well, I'd probably agree with all the bad reviews about this movie because, frankly, I thought it was crap, I mean the actors did a terrible acting job and the script was terrible. Although the special effects have not been a bit bad, but I think it should have been a lot harder than that. I mean, how was Clara Bryant successfully placed in this movie? I mean, she'd do a lot better if she looked a little bit further away and that was the same with Kristen darling, I mean her character dies and she does not mind trying to defend herself, I mean, it has to be a total joke. She should at least do much better than what she likes to become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery. But the point is that the actors did a terrible job and the director and the writer who made the film. they should have gone to film school to think of some better ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my methods because they are probably thinking the same thing.
