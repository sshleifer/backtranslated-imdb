Man kills bear. The man becomes a bear. Man / bear meets bear. Man / bear gets man / bear after meeting a bear. The end. Seriously, this is the whole plot for this movie. Yes, I simplified it to the extreme, but you understood. I just wish I might not have seen him. <br /> <br /> The alluded 'man / bear' is a Native American Indian who kills the mother of a cub. And while that may be touching, it certainly does not really attract the potential conflict between the two parties. In addition, there was some undue use of the two moose in the film. But this is beyond the point. <br /> <br /> Overall, far below par. It certainly needed a lot more to be fun. Maybe more laughter from the minor characters and more drama between the two main bears. That's what separates bad movies from good ones. "D"
