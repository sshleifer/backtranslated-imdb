DO NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it's so bad that it's absolutely hilarious. It's possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. Sometimes we really do debate if that was bad on purpose, but we're pretty sure it's not. Characters appear out of nowhere as if they had already been set, the scene constantly changes into this warehouse, and the Vampire Assassin ends up having about 6 climactic fights with the enemies before finally reaching the chief vampire. You can also enjoy the first and only face of the Vampire Slayer, as he never changes his expression, despite his obvious attempts to do so. So if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh hysterically then I suggest this movie as long as you enter with an open mind. Do not expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it will be even worse than that. I really want to buy this movie and put it on top of my selection of comedy movies. Right next to the Anchor.
