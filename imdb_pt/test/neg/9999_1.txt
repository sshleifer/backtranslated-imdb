When all we have most is practically reality TV shows with people playing idiotic role for whatever reason is too fat or can not sing or cook is worth a damn than I know that Hollywood ran out of original ideas. I can not remember a time when something original or clever has appeared on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with seeing the hobos become fools? I would have thought that these types of programs would have a complete cycle, but every year they come up with something new that is stranger than the previous one. Okay, so people need to lose weight ... most Americans need to lose weight. I just think we all to some extent like to see people humiliated. Maybe it'll make us feel better when we see somebody looking like an idiot. I do not know, but I just want something clever to come out and not insult your intelligence.
