An obvious vanity for Julie in her first film with Blake. We will see. Where do we start. She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems it by falling in love; his friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she ends up as a hero. IT'S OK. The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for the French intelligence can not even be described, and we will not even mention the romantic scenes of Rock with a woman. (By the way, when they visit a museum, look at their look - I reran in video and it's invaluable). Is it a scam or is it a classic romantic or is it a war movie? I do not know and neither do you.
