This movie is absolute rubbish and it gets even worse for the final, very time consuming! <br /> <br /> The plot is messy and worked, the actors could not care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they would not be paid), and the sets were no boring features and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and decided not to bother with the last 5 minutes, as I assumed that the actors would have fallen asleep. More unrecoverable wasted time! <br /> <br /> If you need to see it, take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills once. But maybe you need an antidepressant! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's good if the celluloid degrades.
