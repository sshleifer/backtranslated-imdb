(A possible secondary spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but silly movie that did its job and was actually quite good. The sequel "The Lost World" had some decent moments, but they were ruined by the final part of the movie that had a T-Rex in San Diego. Now in "Jurassic Park III," that little story was in the first and in the sequel, it was thrown out of the window and replaced with only 90 minutes of action basically non-stop, which would have worked if the movie had not been recorded. so badly done. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, who gets a proposal from a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to escort them to an island to help them find their son, which has been lost for more than 2 months. But of course this island is inhabited by dinosaurs and of course the plane is about to fall, leaving them stuck with a bunch of dinosaurs behind them. <br /> <br /> This was obviously conceived as a thrill ride with no real story, but even at that level the film does not deliver. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to catch the little magic left in the "Jurassic" movies and end life. <br /> <br /> The dinos look good, though they're just fair now and not too scary. The bottom line is that it's not a very good movie, even as a thrill ride. * of 4 stars.
