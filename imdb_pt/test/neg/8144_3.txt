For an indy movie this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 but overall it only gets a 3. The effects are not horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all the kids like a lot indy low budget horror movies do. The acting is a lot of wood, but at least they had a better "showing" than some movies in the tight budget category. It's filmed a lot inside a building instead of a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. It is a resident evil rip off about an evil corporation invading a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies. I would have liked to have seen some kind of creatures rather than the big villain being just another super zombie. I try not to write spoilers, but this review has a be warned! SPOILER ALERT !!! Not only do some of the cast seem to shrug their shoulders beyond the zombies (they are recycled several times, but at least they have more than 5 people playing). But one of the twists of the story does not really fly with me. The incoming deputy is revealed on the payroll of evil corporations. He kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets up with the bad guy in the head in an office talking about cleaning up the mess. The deputy has just shown us that he is a very bad person too and talks how he can clean it (which means killing all surviving witnesses) no problem. But then 2 seconds later, he is helping them. There was no real "change of heart" emotion or anything that made me feel that this thug stopped killing an innocent guy a few minutes ago and then talked about getting everyone in trouble not to be his savior. There was no incident or anything to make me buy it. Worth watching if you are a fan of low budget movies, otherwise you will not like this.
