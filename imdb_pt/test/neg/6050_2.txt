OK, so Herc is a piece ... but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted, wasted ... ah mankind! <br /> <br /> Poor Sean Astin had to follow his master up to the very hills of New Zealand that ... wait! Could it be that? Someone on the Lord of the Rings production team was making home movies in their spare time! Yes, that's it! <br /> <br /> I wish I could say at least that he was promising. <br /> <br /> Special effects were often laughable. <br /> <br /> But, Herc was a piece. NH
