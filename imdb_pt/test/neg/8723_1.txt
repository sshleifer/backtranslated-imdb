Drivel. Total trash. Writers should not have read the book or seen the David Lynch movie. Not worth wasting your time. <br /> <br /> More time does not do better. Although deeper than Lynch's film, it has great accuracy, and fundamental parts of the story. <br /> <br /> "One night at Roxbury" is worth more of your time.
