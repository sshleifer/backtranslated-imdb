Witchcraft / Witchcraft / La Casa 4 / and anything else you want to call it. How about ... Crud. <br /> <br /> A gathering of people at a resort on the island of Massachusetts is besieged by the evil magic powers of an evil witch who kills each individual using cruel and torturous methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) is taking pictures for Linda (Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resembles Winnie the Poo's cartoon EE-YOR), a virgin who studies witchcraft at the island's resort without permission. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, portraying an incredibly coarse bitch) is interested in maybe buying the resort and, along with her husband Freddie (Robert Champagne, who is always looking at other women much younger than him), pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and grandson Tommy (Michael Manchester, who seems to be bored, probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this garbage), go on boat to the resort being watched by Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), son of Realtor Tony Giordano, obviously, a puppy that is getting wet. Along with these people is the architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a nymphomaniac) who can help Rose redesign the resort. The captain of the boat is killed by The Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, wearing his make-up and extra lip palette) and a storm is brewing. The boat leaves alone (.. guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black, I think) with everyone trapped in the decrepit resort, which is in dire need of repairs. Most victims, before they know their terrible destinies, are carried through a kind of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension (perhaps a kind of hell or something) where they are tortured by these demons dressed in ragged clothes . . A victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney, baked while the others light the fireplace. A poor soul is tortured by twisted ropes wrapped around its flesh before they are found hanging from the snout of a swordfish piercing its neck. A guy is choking slowly as his veins swell (and bleed) and the blood vessels in his neck explode on Hasselhoff's face! A guy is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim is possessed with her hair standing in the voice of another woman. One of them is raped by this demonic man with a "sick" mouth while the infernal hobos are nearby cheerfully clapping. The film, despite the excesses, is mostly a boring food for those who really want to see the low point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair, who deserve more than that. Almost unbearable at times, building little to no suspense. Clumsy execution of death sequences that seem cheap and laughable. Of course something is fine, but most of the movie shows victims after they've gone through the doorbell. We get a chance to see pregnant women (who look exactly like stunts in bad wig costumes) jumping out of three-story windows. Oh, and the reflected face of The Lady in Black usually appears on inanimate objects for the characters to see. Tommy has a small Sesame Street recorder that records the Jumbo corners of Lady in Black, obviously used for later. For some reason, The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. He is not afraid of her, because Tommy is too bored to show any expression on his face, much less fear. Need I say more? This is a real stinker. Ugh
