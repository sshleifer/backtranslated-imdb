First of all, the first season is unbearably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent and the direction is terrible. It works like a bad video of a high school play, characters strolling through the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing as a random conversation in prison. Soon the show gets better, but not much. The return of the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue of Augustus Hill, in a wheelchair, played by Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is consistently bad is during the monologues of poor performance art, most of which happens in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and usually has nothing to do with what is happening on the show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, bad ideas in Oz could fill a multi-volume encyclopedia. Consider the whole situation, first of all. Prisoners are able to feel comfortable getting drunk, using drugs, and they not only have CD players (CDs, they may well distribute steak knives), but all incoming emails are carefully examined by the PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. Guards that do not do much. Near the end of the second season, the grandson of an old prisoner is diagnosed with leukemia, and all the prisoners throw in thick packs of $ 20 and $ 50 to help send him to the hospital. Disneyworld to fulfill your desire. These have to be the richest prisoners in the world. Each of the Oz prisoners suddenly became a loving and loving guy, except for Kenny Wangler, an annoying character, but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing. Even Adibisi wanted to be cool. But okay, because there is no order or meaning in the program, so even this is not a big distraction. <br /> <br /> Later, surprisingly, there is a boxing scene in which an inmate is wearing a "I Love Cops T-shirt". In prision!! You can imagine?? I have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. I sent him an old photo of us with some friends at school, and in the picture, one of my friends was holding a "I Love Police" sticker, and one of the "woods" (guys who'd been in prison for years and years) the photo but just took it and tore it to pieces. My cousin was lucky. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also constantly berates the guards and even senior officers for not calling him Bricks. One of them even tried to bribe him to an English class. You may lose track of who is in charge, the prisoners or the guards. More than one investigator, for example, goes to jail in disguise and is killed trying to stop drug trafficking. Personally, I would simply stop letting the prisoners inspect the correspondence received, instead of risking the lives of investigators. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Shillinger's son, OD, is lonely and no one thinks of asking the guard how he got the drugs. He just ... got them, I guess. And be sure to pay attention, otherwise you will lose the reason why prisoners have enough money to be able to buy astral dermal grafts when they have bad gums. I did not know that guests in maximum security prisons had such luxurious treatment options. How about that, when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's agenda so he can ask what breed of gums he got, Faraj gets so terrified he goes to the director and leaves the job on the spot. Do not doctors and dentists have the right to ask not to see certain prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly make the announcement to the entire jail, Robson asks to see Dr. Faraj, and is taken to his office, brought without knocking, and the guard promptly leaves without saying a word. They may well give you a gun. <br /> <br /> I should not continue with stupid ideas in this program, but it's like a flood, I can not stop it. Who thought of Chinese refugees who do not speak Chinese and disappear en masse unless they are needed? Who thought of the religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? Who, despite Robson's gum transplant? What is the matter with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon because he clearly does not belong to the prison and Busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was nothing more than a ridiculous means to an end, so to speak. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that do not give at all, that are constant. An Irishman arrives in jail and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the whole prison, the bomb turns out to be a failure, and the episode ends with him being taken away by the bomb squad after the entire jail is evacuated. Nothing is heard from him or the whole situation again. It's like it never happened. In one episode, prisoners receive dogs to train. What the hell?? If that were not enough, during a training session, a guard fired his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise. No one seems to care. <br /> <br /> I also like when any kind of quarrel explodes, the guilty are set aside, they say nothing, and the guards or director or Sister Pete or whoever it is always says, "I I hope you do not think I'll let it go !! " And then they move away and let it pass. The public will not remember. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a prison drama that might be better as a play. A short. At least a low budget movie. There simply is not enough here to support a multi-season TV show. Then again, I watched six seasons on DVD. Sometimes I do not understand ...
