The somewhat aggressive brother of a suicide discovers that he and his mother are afflicted in the same way (acting out), but that the father is grumpy and blaming himself. Writer and director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams, characters with question marks hovering over them, and then puts all the points of the story in the most obvious terms: Suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family sickness! Ultimately, to wrap things up with a neat bow, Harris wants to make sure we will not miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder, but then spelling it all out in an elemental and sentimental way. The fun performance of Sigourney Weaver as the family matriarch is dryly disconnected and she is a joy - that is, until Harris gives her a new look (complete with new sensible hairstyle). It's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** in ****
