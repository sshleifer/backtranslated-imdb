Film positively ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in this type of film, they can send their retirement documents and collect full-time social security. <br /> <br /> While the idea that a 35-year-old video-game swinger loses his apartment and is forced to live with Grandma Roberts and Jones and Knight borders, that is foolishly treated. Imagine the 3 bags full of things that the grandson Alex left in his house and Jones going to bed with someone who can qualify as his grandson! <br /> <br /> The sequels of video games are as silly as the rest of the world. movie. The variety of characters that Alex works with is unbelievable because he likes his weed habit along with others. <br /> <br /> Terrible best describes this miserable movie.
