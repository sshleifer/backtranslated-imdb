This review took longer to write than I took to watch this movie. It's just bad. The plot is terrible compared to the TV shows. It's flat, bland and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course the LoG ran out of ideas long before this movie was illuminated by green lights. Viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero dynamism, zilch chemistry. <br /> <br /> A movie that does not know what it is, made without any love to a mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling a bit angry that so much money has been wasted. <The LoG was obviously made an offer they could not refuse, or maybe their egos simply got the best of them. It's a gloomy marketing drive that might have been better when LoG was fresher and more inspired. <br /> <br /> I, however, knew when to stop and did it. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone try to convince me of the finer points of this movie!
