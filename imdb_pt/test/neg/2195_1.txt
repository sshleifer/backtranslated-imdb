When, when will Hollyweird write a decent movie based on computers? I can not believe people really consider this film a reliable story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system could survive with this kind of irritating scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen, but if you really tried to use it for any length of time you would go crazy. <br /> <br /> As for "tracking" people, the way they did it simply can not be done that way. . Network security alone would prevent this from happening. The record of traits was ridiculous, to say the least. Regarding the software that was supposed to be installed, no system administrator would allow such critical software to be installed on a production system until it was tested, retested and tested again on a system of sacks sand. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst possible part of the movie was the "virus." There is no way a virus works on one operating system will work on any other system. And as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds, it just minds belief. There is no way for an open remote connection to have the necessary superuser access that would allow the deletion of files from the system. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I can not be bothered. <br /> <br /> <br /> A porn has a better thought plot than this pile of crap.
