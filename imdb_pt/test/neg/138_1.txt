I'M BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Films <br /> <br /> Pros: Absolutely none <br /> <br /> Cons: I I do not even know where to start! <br /> <br /> Plan Summary: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, talks and acts more like a live action cartoon character. That's all the plot I took from this movie. <br /> <br /> Revision: I remember when I was in ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown named Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this movie are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is only audible when the music plays, and the movie seems to have been filmed on a publicly accessible channel. Luckily, I did not buy this movie like all my other degenerate classmates from downtown. My rating: 1 out of 10 My verdict: Avoid this video as its a sexually transmitted disease.
