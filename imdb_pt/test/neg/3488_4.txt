One thing I have noticed about the British horror films of the '70s is that they do not withstand repeated screenings. THEATER OF BLOOD is a case in point, as are all Amicus anthology films. Add THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR to the list <br /> <br /> Much of the drama in this movie revolves around building a revelation at the end. Once you know what the revelation is, it becomes a fairly flat movie. It opens with a pretty good hook, but after that we are treated with long, boring sequences of two ladies doing small talk. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people watch a horror movie waiting for some ladies to talk? The only type of interest to be found in THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR is the anti-smoking posture. Some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film, but watch closely and you will see that every time a squadron lights up for a fly, it is dead. Quite strange to consider that attitudes towards smoking were not as hysterical as nowadays
