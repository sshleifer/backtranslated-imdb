Hey! The rancor 2! What up man? I have a friend that I would like you to meet. The Grudge 2 meets Johnny's Worst 2006 list. The worst of Johnny's worst lists is Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I was under the impression that this should be a sequel to The Grudge, rather than a remake. If that's the case, why not do nothing but redo the original? This floater does not even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the strange contortionist girl making that irritating croaking sound. <br /> <br /> A sound in which I would recommend you not to start. It was kind of scary the first time I heard it, but I've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's very good to follow its course. And it got even more annoying to the 20 people in the audience who thought it would be fun to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet place in the movie. Sigh. <br /> <br /> People, YOU ARE NOT FUNNY, SO, JUST STOP! I promise you, EVERY SINGLE TIME a character was walking slowly through an empty room (which is about 97% of the movie), someone in the audience would start, "Uhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk". Yes, I know it's a horrible way to replicate the sound with lyrics, but you get the gist. Then some guy in the audience would laugh and, not to be left behind, delivering his own interpretation. I was very close to just going through the audience and punching random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to make me start. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There is not a single scare or original idea throughout the film. There is no memorable performance performance. Are you a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar? Welp, enjoy your two minutes of screen and a line of dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope you can handle the fact that she has nothing more to do than go around looking like she is suffering from a pinched nerve. Do you believe the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than Grudge's? <br /> <br /> At least the original was rather scary and boasted of some effective jumping scenes. I did not jump once during this lametrosity (yes, I did the word, deal with it). That's right. Not once. The "scares" are so fabricated and are so flagrantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no value of shock once the "catch" moment arrives. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you're always four or five scenes ahead. <br /> <br /> There are also some weird scenes that make no sense at all. One that immediately comes to mind is a scene in which a girl drinks a liter of milk and then begins regurgitating back into the jar. There is? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of it during the movie. Laughing. Sighing. Head shaking. Fall asleep (I did it twice). <br /> <br /> The film even makes a 1/5 heart attempt at a plot plot. Wow. It's so bad I do not think we should even dignify it, labeling it a turnaround. Did they really think anyone would be surprised by the revelation of who was hiding under the hood? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And of course the end goes all the way without closing, "we can have another sequel." As soon as the credits rolled, the audience booed. My feelings exactly. If the public had paid money for this hamburger, then things would probably be violent, and I would have been happy to lead the charge. <br /> <br /> We learn from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of anger, then a curse is left behind. Much like a Ben Affleck film, it is a "stain" that always becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend, its sequel will be rushed, and most of the time will be as bad as that and leave a stain on any theater where O movie shows. <br /> <br /> A GIST <br /> <br /> If you are a total coward and have never seen Grudge, then this may provide some cheap scares. But I strongly recommend saving your money, otherwise there is a good chance you are the one to leave the cinema with a grudge.
