So I give him a star for true quality, but I'd give it eight-thirty for sheer fun. An incredibly strange hybrid of sexual comedy and vigilante thriller, "Young Warriors" is just the kind of bad movie you usually expect to find while browsing the video, but rarely does. It starts with about half an hour of craziness, sex jokes and juvenile antics (including an olive in the martini joke that must be seen not to be believed). So the younger sister of the main character is raped by a gang of dark motorcyclists (an objectionable scene that prevents me from giving a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not entertainment!), And the main character stays with the rest of his fraternity sexually maddened brothers to help you on a mission to cleanse the city, find responsible motorcyclists and kill any of the criminals they come across along the way. <br /> <br /> It's hilarious, fun, non-stop nasty rape scene, and it's essential to viewing any serious bad movie fan. Trust me - I put my time in these things, and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a large slo-mo shooting flashing in a sleazy bar (with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot which is quite impressive), a couple of decent actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine) a pair of recognizable semi-famous faces (Lynda Day George, the queen of the scream Linnea Quigley), and some relatives of famous people (the brother of Chuck Norris, Mike, the member of the clan Van Patten, James). He still has one of these great "What have we become?" enter morality lesson finals, although the turning point occurs when vigilante fraternists arm a handful of boys stealing a store with a toy gun. I always wondered why this was the catalyst that made the hero think; after all, if they were children and not hardened criminals, and if they had a real weapon or not, they were still actually robbing a store, then, as far as I know, it was just another job well done for our watchful brotherhood. Boys, right? Wonderful things. Highly recommended, just do not blame me when you like it, in spite of yourself.
