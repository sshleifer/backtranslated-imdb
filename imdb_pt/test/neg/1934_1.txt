It's probably a cultural thing - somehow the natives of this country have been conditioned to find these things funny. I experienced this phenomenon firsthand during an outdoor movie event where this film was screened before the film. Most of the indigenous public laughed, and no, this was not in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children, this was in a well-to-do area, and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults. <br /> <br /> So it must be possible in some way to find this fun but honest for good, I have no idea what it needs --- maybe be in the air or in the water, prolonged exposure that causes this condition. Something must cause this, obviously, the only thing I can say is that I'm sure of what it does not cause: the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are no jokes. It's a brain death, stupid, meaningless, bland, lame. It is, in short, a waste of time. Any Tom and Jerry is funnier, even funerals are funnier. <br /> <br /> If you've been lucky enough to never have seen any of the Stooges' performances: it's three guys behaving, running, even talking like retarded babies, causing all kinds of bland, no real purpose and no real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in the crowd watching this crap in this country can be quite exasperating because you feel like you are at a party with a lot of pot smokers and you are the only one who has not smoked at all. So unless you're prepared to intoxicate yourself to make it bearable, or come equipped with what it is that makes people think that watching three ugly old men behave like idiots is funny, my advice on this is: Stay fit. So far.
