I was fooled as well. Here I was expecting all kinds of people eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you get. <br /> <br /> An hour and a half of nothing but awkward silences with some weird face that is not weird enough to be scary. <br /> <br /> I thought there was not like $ 5 to be too much for a movie. <br /> <br /> Damn, I was so wrong. It was very difficult to watch the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake. It's not so good that it's bad. Not really that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> It's nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> PIECE OF CRAP !!!!!!!!
