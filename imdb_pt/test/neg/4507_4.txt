This is a horror movie of the numbers, starring Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as a pair of psychologists who buy and old mansion and invite a small team of friends and patients to help clean the place. Unbeknownst to them, the mansion houses a cellar door - the gateway to hell. If you're in the mood for a clich√© horror movie then look no further but if you want something inventive then this little movie will not appeal to you. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (instead subjugated, although the scene in which a guy cuts off his hand with a saw - is very horrible for you. <br /> <br /> Fans of inventive killing scenes will not like this, because all the characters seem to be electrocuted somehow). NUDDADE: $ (Nothing to speak of. Mary Louise Weller adds good looks, but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (Cliched, but worth seeing, though.) That does not offer anything new to the genre but the cast of Victor Buono - which is as ominous as a Santa department store - seems have attracted some viewers). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The best performances are from Crenna and Pettet with the other actors simply "phoning" their roles. <br /> <br /> The writer can not develop any character outside of Pettet's character and seems to have forgotten of Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) who disappears for about twenty minutes and only reappears to be electrocuted as everyone in fashion.
