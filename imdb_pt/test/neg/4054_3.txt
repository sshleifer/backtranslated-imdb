The Tender Hook, or who killed the Australian film industry? Case No 278. Does this excuse excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda and Hugo Weaving in a gangster drama of the jazz era? and turns it into a sloppily soporific paced and executed. McHeath (Weaving) is a boxing and gangster promoter and illiterate in operation; for no apparent reason he is given to sing songs of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen before the fights. As postmodern. How stupid. Anyway. There is a boxing fighter, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes the latest protégé of McHeath instead of his unfortunate alby Alby prisonmate (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> Witch Iris (Byrne) makes eyes at him. Sexual tension shrinks beneath the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Iris (these flower girls stuck together) who appears onstage without announcing herself. They practice dancing together and talk about "connecting" with guys. In the 1920s I stopped telling anachronisms after that. There is a sub-theme involving Japanese beer and a background story of brook pearl fishermen. I do not know what it was. For some reason that is not exactly (at all) explained, Byrne puts cocaine into Art Lemonade. McHeath thinks he's a drunk and the bastard. Byrne plot and schemes to help you again. She is great for plot and schematics. Most cause problems. McHeath's two guns, the burly Ronnie (John Batchelor) and the Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), debate with McHeath when he realizes his role in one of Iris's schemes, but Ronnie becomes irritated when he sees McHeath crying. Many virtually incoherent scenes enter the path of the movie that finally ends. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time working with director of photography Geoffrey Simpson creating some beautiful pictures but fails to generate a sense of style that could have compensated for and decorated the weak and pathetically weak script; unfortunately Ogilvie's sense of cinematic grammar, the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposure, is incredibly incompetent. In an early scene, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. How she got there, and indeed who she is, seems to have escaped Ogilvie's mind. There are many other examples of this sloppiness. Where he pursues the poetic shortage, he attains only irritation. He gains awkward performances from actors who are usually unreliable, mistakenly confusing Weaving and relying on Byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted doll humanity while sealing it with an incomprehensible character. <br /> <br /> It may not matter much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plot, preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir movies and adorned with roughly scattered quotes from pop culture. But that does not happen. It's boring.
