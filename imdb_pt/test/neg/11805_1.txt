No one can say that I was not warned as I read the comments (user and external) but like most of us attracted to horror movies ... the curiosity has this cat. (Come on, we all scream for the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know it's a horror that the fans are always dying to know what's there, even though we know it will be bad.) <br /> <br /> The point is that this movie made me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares ... tricks are allowed), or because the actors and the dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) Or why the movie is so bad I'm being educated here). What really drives me crazy is that the movie is not just a rip off of BWP but also a lazy and discouraged one. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo the BWP then cheers for them but they did not even try. The film was made with little effort or care and this is the most unforgivable sin in the horror movie (or any other)!
