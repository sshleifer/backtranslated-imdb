Unbelievably disappointed. The pace was slow. The unbelievable characters and throughout the film as a whole make me bored and dissatisfied. There was no real plot that could keep him spinning around the movie and keeping him interested. The assault itself never offered any enthusiasm and did not look very good despite passing. <br /> <br /> There was no depth or background enough for any character, and the character of Laurance Fishbourne was something I looked forward to, unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play the brute brute and is much preferred as a nice character Columbus, one of my favorite actors (in stomp the yard) disappointed me with his performance, his character was bleak and you could hardly see what prompted him to reason. <br /> <br /> The only character I think offered anything for the movie was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is very small and insignificant, I think his touch was added to an all gloomy movie. <br /> <br /> In Conclusion, buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
