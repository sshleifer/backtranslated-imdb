When the word "gifts" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately disposable. For some reason, people who are able to create good art do not seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give a second installment of the Demons trilogy. On the one hand, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to align the kind of talent on the Demons 2 soundtrack. On the other, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course, she was eleven when this movie was made, and several years away from her apparent decision that she would stylize her acting after the start of Helen Mirren: smoldering looks and little clothing.) Well, Lambert Bava comes from one of the The best dynasties of Italy in this strange subgenre of horror known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who may have invented the genre in the 60s). And the original Demons are a must-see for fans of the B-horror movies of the '80s. So how bad can that be, right? Very bad. The demons continue to attack the Italian media when the film is shown in a modern Italian skyscraper where many people who live their lives have their televisions in the background. They are all watching a kind of combined video / mater video from some types of investigative reporters trying to get proof of the events of the first movie (which seems to put the deadline of this no more than a few days after the first movie). Through the usual extra inability of the horror movie to focus, reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he enters the TV screen to start the plague again. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's so bad. About the only good thing anyone can say about the movie is that the soundtrack (when you're not being hounded by the likes of The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is impressive. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who started as part of the Argento Dynasty and has since made films like Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Hire if you are thinking of drinking too much but it is certainly not by far the fun of the original. Cronenberg's wonderfully funny prank, Shivers (aka They Came From Within), is much better.
