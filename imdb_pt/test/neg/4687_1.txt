You know the story of "Sweeney Todd" now, probably thanks to the recent Tim Burton movie. You probably do not know, though, about this story about Andy Milligan - that famous marketer who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. <br /> <br /> happen eventually. In my years watching horror and exploration from the 60s to the 80s, I'm finally reviewing an Andy Milligan movie. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us a lot of horror and exploration films - none of which was good, and hardly watchable. "The Bloodthirsty Butcher" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is dialogue and well, it is spoken, and this is one of the things you will find here - many and many conversations. The film reaches levels almost "Hands The Fate" sometimes, while you wait tirelessly for something to happen. Although I like cheap goreos effects, violence is very small and despite its reputation, the "chest" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love scurrying cheap and despicable as much as the next movie devotee, but "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is the kind of bad thing the MST3K would mercilessly destroy. Unfortunately, Milligan would have died of AIDS in 1991, and if there was some movie of him I would say I like, it would be the delirious "The Ghastly Ones." This is not a "creepy" one, but it's bad.
