This movie is not worth seeing, at least not in a movie theater. The story is hard to follow and understand (starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or if it's so bad / weird that sometimes it seems to be. Sirens and American lights on Swedish police cars are just one example. The acting of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as always, but I think Jenny Lampa, acting like Jasmin, acts very badly. Zara Zetterqvist acts very well, she has not been seen as an actress in Swedish films for a long time. If you still want to watch it, wait until it is released on DVD or displayed on the TV.
