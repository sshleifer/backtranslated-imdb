This is quite typical of the Sci-Fi Channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We have some alien socks dummies on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he gave to win a performance. And save the day. Everyone in this is totally expendable; the ex-wife who goes through the old clich√© of not liking Lou, then, of course, comes back to love him again in the end. The obnoxious state senator who is mistreated in the beginning, and a bunch of dull bodyguards who run a lot. Then there is an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason except to provide us with 3% more back. He spends all the middle part of the movie hidden in a box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, dragging flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the speed limit in your car, the atmospheric friction can make you explode in flames. Then he falls into the hood of a car, entering the horizontal. Kind of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor, I guess. It does not really damage the car, just tilt the hood a bit. Later, Lou gets in a helicopter and goes behind the train. Even if the train is only two minutes ahead, it takes a good half hour to pick it up. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks as big as the hills that fly over it. Then it flies to the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a pot of gas and threw it against a wall, so they overlaid the effect of the flame on the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter could not park in time, it was carrying five tons of nitroglycerin. Then the eco-terrorist ends up exploding, but instead of blasting in all directions like most blasts, it explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. So there's all the business about not being able to stop the train because that would allow the aliens to leave, but it looks like the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why would it keep them on the train? I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you have a couple of hours that absolutely need to be eliminated, and it's for this movie or reruns on the Food Network as well, let's think about it, some of these chefs are cute. Usually, these films have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, some T & A, or a character who really has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I did not really see any of it here.
