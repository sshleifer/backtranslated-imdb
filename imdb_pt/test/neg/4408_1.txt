Did I waste my time? This is a very pretentious movie. At first you'll think there's something going on, but the minute about 30 minutes pass you realize that nothing is happening. I waited another 20 minutes and until then I was so frustrated that I started reading the reviews about the IMDb and realized that the director wasted precious time on so many people. <br /> <br /> Meaningless, boring and unbelievable movie. To stay away. So many good soundtracks. I'll make a point for the police inspector's joke because this worked for me. I laughed for a long time, but otherwise a very bad movie. Stay away. 1 out of 10.
