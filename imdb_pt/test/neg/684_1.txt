This is the movie is very bad. I like to turn on the TV while napping and this movie felt like it would be a good thing to sleep, and the boy was wrong. My body literally woke me up to sleep and said "Hey ... this movie is horrible ... you have to watch it". I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid tangles. Something about unintentional comedy makes me go. This movie is extremely bad. I really do not know how to express it properly, other than recommending that you watch just to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should watch with people. I was making the best jokes during this movie and no one was there to listen to them. Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
