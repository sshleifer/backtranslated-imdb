I really do not know if this should be science fiction or horror. It was confusing to say the least. What really bothered me, however, was the lack of development of the story between the characters. <br /> <br /> Sherif's 17-year-old daughter (Bruce Boxleitner) (Clara Bryant) is stuck with him over the summer, and they do not spend 30 seconds together on the screen at the same time. <br /> <br /> The Native American (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) apparently has a hard time with the sheriff, but they do not spend time together either. <br /> <br /> The sexy secretary (Kristen Honey) ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two together. <br /> <br /> The bad developer against the Native Americans is an overused History, but I personally like evil developers catching theirs while I live in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed with it was the creature. It was original. I've never seen anything like it and am a sucker for new creatures.
