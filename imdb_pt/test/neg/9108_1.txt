This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad party I go. It is clear from the outset that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously ... the other principles were walking along its lines. I think they have a smell of how much it stank at first and they were going through the motions for their payments. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but was spared from splitting screen space with any of the principles until the final scene in which he was like an actor walking into a college, which defined the contrast. Some actors do not look very misaligned. Some actors should not increase to one part. These two statements apply to the "Police Academy" Steve. His slovenly look translates to drunken and indigent and its volume makes it look like a lumpy potato, not yummy. Even with one of the worst scripted dialogues in Hollywood history and you have a bad movie. I can only guess that all the principles really really needed the money to remodel or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys who should have typed it off. I would love to know the background story of this disaster.
