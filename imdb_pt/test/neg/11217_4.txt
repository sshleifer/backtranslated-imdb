This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It requires a different approach than usual, since allegory will not reward dissection. "I'm an American. I'm a puritan virgin." "We are Europeans, we are cultured and crazy about sex." "It's cool when we all screw." So much to talk about! Well, there is some kind of fact, compared to your topless 60's number of years. And the enervating 'class' patina, at least, provides clean, detailed compositions. But what kind of thing is that to say about pornography? OK, then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) left was the first time Brigitte Maier came on the scene. There are efforts to play a good variety of race and age, while there are no two men next to each other; the black guy suffers a premature attack of coitus interrupted editorial. And several takes or not, a perhaps indescribable act in IMDb seems to have been partially simulated by a surgical hose. Still, I stayed awake, and it was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean?!
