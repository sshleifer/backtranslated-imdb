Tired, garbage dreck. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. His dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The plot was a mess. Forced performance. The cinematography remained in the uninspired. Lazy and nonsensical. Kim Gordon and his character had no reason to be there. No one else for that matter. I could not have given two farts to any of the 'characters'. His emotions jumped and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroine. Empty and bland. Why do I have to write ten lines of text here to make my point? I think I summed it up in the first three words. But, obviously, it is not enough. I think this is the last time I'll worry about wasting my time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw 'Clean' and thought it was pretty ineffective too. Again, I did not care about the characters, whether they lived or died.
