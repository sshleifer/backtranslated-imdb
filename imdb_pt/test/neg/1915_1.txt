I do not know why I did not like this movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too masculine or something. Who was the target audience here? If you are and like it, then I am happy for you. Personally, I found a little pill. The characters were uninteresting and unpleasant, the script was simply embarrassing and some, though not all, of the acting had no inspiration. Mawkish, tedious and occasionally nauseating - certainly there is something better in it. <br /> <br /> On a related issue: Why is it that whenever I see Chris Klein in a movie, I feel like slapping him? Anyone else understand this?
