There is not much to add to what others have commented on, the movie fails a lot where it should not, has no depth in the planning of the robbery and the characters are so unbelievable. One thing What made me wonder was that although the rest of the class was struggling to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck because there should be no other way to open it, face inside the truck, can very easily remove the floor of the truck that happens to have a hole so he can leave, and then return, without being noticed by anyone, because nobody else could think that he could leave there or even better , which they could have entered from there. <br /> Promising, but not exactly there.
