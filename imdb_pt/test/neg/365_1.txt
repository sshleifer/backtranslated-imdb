I say "movie" because this does not deserve the denomination "movie", and certainly not "movie". I regret paying for the rent, and although I've never been in a movie before, it would have been if I had seen it in a movie theater. A society living underground in the future (oooh, that's original), many burning drums, inexplicable ambient light shining through the windows, an ungrateful woman and her silent son ... the list goes on. C. Thomas Howell affects the hoarse voice of the stereotypical solitary; You know how Eastwood was made to death. He needs special glasses to remind his wife and son, but in flashbacks, he's the same age! Talk about a weak memory! I looked incredulous when the little Abe boy randomly puts a code on a door and opens it! No tension, with religious expression (what religion?) Under / overtones ... sadder of everything: I expected better from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst movie experience in my life.
