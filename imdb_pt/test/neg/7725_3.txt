I saw the first House of the Dead and hoped that a root canal would be more enjoyable to watch, so when it was not so bad, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I then took my. I hope the second one is well too ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Apparently I'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I watch again and I force myself to see whatever all the people who gave good reviews saw, or wonder if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job at roles that were below them. They deserve to be in better movies. <br /> <br /> Special effects were good and some of the sympathetic / hateful-able characters that made for a tolerable clock, but for the most part, this movie was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask this because I found myself asking aloud ALL the way through the movie ... somebody did not know how to close the doors behind them so the zombies would not do it ? just wander through the rooms? Only once did (zombies wandering) and I found this a little convenient ... the soldiers enter a room, leave the door open, little or no attention to the same door so the zombies can enter. they feel that way (with the unfortunate "livings" being trapped with no way to escape) and yet only once do the zombies follow them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Maybe, but honestly ... if I was fighting for my life, the last thing I would do would be to enter a room and leave the door open so the zombies could inflate and eat me. <br /> <br /> That's really the only thing that bothered me throughout the movie, and only the film for the most part was a bad sequence for an original not totally abominable.
