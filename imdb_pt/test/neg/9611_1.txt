What happened to parenting shows? The parents in this show are almost as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the younger son for being manipulative, they let her get away with the murder. They may never agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with children and instead they do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they are "cute". This program tells preteens already manipulative that they observe that the technique of "divide and conquer" is the best way to make their parents "crumble". Older children are constantly out of control and get into all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yes, great television, that's fine.
