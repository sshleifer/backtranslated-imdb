Six students from a convent do the unthinkable - mate a nun who was arrogant. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and taking revenge on her murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, basically, that's what's missing. There is more than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was very impressed by it being a low budget film. I'm also confused about whether or not it's in English. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title here is in Italian, but they spoke English in the film (I think, or it may have been dubbed, I still do not know). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real premise of the movie is pretty dumb, and the ending not only does not make sense, but ... does not make sense.
