I can not believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross section of the "bright youngsters" of his day, but I'm sure he wished it had not happened. In my opinion, it is an imprecise piece of gumpf, poorly represented, weakly scripted, pretentiously directed. Brief walks to an imagined reality detonate any mood to the death. The situations are no subtle exaggerations that make the already fragile characters even more unbelievable and detestable. The novel is monotonous, the ending is unsatisfactory and spoils the only sensible message about drugs in the film and the simple storyline ('Withnail and I,' Fear and Repulse) is tested to the extreme with the film's uninteresting motion. In short, this film as a blatant visual attack with no hint of skill or initiative. I condemn this to the heap of ashes in the story and I pray it stays there.
