I would have given this movie a one-star vote if it had not been for the laughter I took of it. Some of the dialogues were just so dumb they make you laugh !! How could anyone really talk like that? Not to mention the fact that bodyguard Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 as a pro and the Michael Pare team of whiners was able to dig a trench full of gasoline and blow up a huge rock at the right time. Someone noticed the lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with the guy saying "Boss, the plane !!" for Michael Stop as soon as the 747 comes into view. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the cute little girls and even the cutest female hijackers. Not to mention that the main kidnapper deserved to die the death he did for being so playful! Imagine escaping from being tied only to be hit by a "beast." Hello. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died on the plane while everyone was eating steak and drinking rum !! Just for laughter, they must do a sequence to show us how they all spend the night in the middle of a category 3 hurricane at the Neptune Atoll. I overheard Michael Pare calling him "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific". Now that would make an interesting movie !!
