First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors that appear in this film and at the time I rented it, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason I was so disappointed was that the outside chest promised me a thriller of suspense. In my eyes, a thriller thriller for British films is something out of a novel by Ruth Rendell, something that has many twists and leaves the viewer with an end that will hardly be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This movie began with the promising note of being such a movie. We have our main character, who suspects a man he does not like, to be involved in an attack and execution that killed the husband of one of his servants. His notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved does not occur to him until she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this time, but from then on, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost kind of a novel about who wants to be with whom and what is the love of a real relationship. The film might have been nice to me if the outer box had spoken of a triangle of twisted lover and had not been labeled as a thriller of suspense. This seemed more like a soap opera story and the initial setting seemed to be a slight distraction to the real content of the movie. I felt that this movie could have done a lot better than that. I felt as if I continued to take the viewer to a great event that never materialized. So I have to give a lower rating than I would have liked and say it fell short of my expectations.
