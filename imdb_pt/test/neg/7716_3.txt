If you have not seen the first one, you must at least meet someone who has and know that it was painful to sit. There was simply nothing good to say about it. So, what is different with the second? Why bother making a follow up to a movie that was unhappy? This one does not take itself too seriously. He knows it was made for TV and does not try to impress with big or serious dialogues. There are times when he tries to be "serious" or "intense", but those moments are so gross you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> We were grateful to all of Uwe Boll's elements and any hint that this had originated from a video game (besides the course title). Do not enter this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends, unless they are in zombie movies, or are interested in making a drinking game in this movie. Take two pictures whenever the character of Ed Quinn mention his dead brother! Take a shot whenever a bullet would have been better place on a zombie's head instead of pumping three in the chest! etc. etc.
