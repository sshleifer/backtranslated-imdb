Still another version of the mother of all the gangster movies, the classic "Godfather" and yet another case of over-hype due to the media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film by Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy, including the other two being the excellent Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans making father-child double on the screen for the first time, is definitely a treat to watch. Not only strong performances, but his perfect chemistry is the highest scoring point for which Varma should be applauded. However, the same equation of the pair is missing from the other characters in the film. Reason, the other characters look more like esp cardboard caricatures. the villains represent the typical villains of Bollywood. A character who attracts attention is the eldest son played by Kaykay, but, again, can not hold due to incomplete characterization. . Drama and conflict are awakened by the overuse of close-shots, which has a claustrophobic effect just needed to build an environment. The haunting score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani and Anup Dev), along with dark and dark background superimposed by powerful images (camerawork by Amit Roy) contribute to visuals so typical of Ramu style. But there is an overuse of Music, although fortunately there are no songs in the film. But the current public's interest in "smart growth" can be sustained only on the shoulders of two strong artists and visuals? I think not. Certainly, the public "maangey more" and here the film can not deliver. In any adaptation in order to add a new dimension, the greatest prerequisite is the Roadmap, which is slow here, not being sharp in places and therefore the pace decreases quite frequently. What the public finally submits is a highly predictable drama, very common, with very few surprise elements. The director of Top Stunt, Allan Amin Ghani, is also not in top shape. Some scenes that require different treatment include: a minister is speaking ill of Sarkar and the son is listening; Sarkar Jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies, an easily motivated son to kill his own father, a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him, a police commissioner beating Sarkar Jr. - all this requires a more realistic and forceful approach, which is the basis for creating the necessary conflict. Dialogues are weak for example. look at an amateur line where a CM tells Sarkar Jr. "Wo jo tha police commissioner na usay maine hata diya". The women's staff take over Sarkar's work is completely ignored. The uninterrupted negotiations over criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also seem a little out of place. In fact, the film follows a graphic very similar to the one of the own production of Ramu - Ab Tak Chhappan. In describing the battle between good and evil, the other side of life - law, police, administration, and politics - is completely ignored. Certainly, more is expected in content. Here the film definitely falls short and can not rise above an average tariff. Dear Ramu, agreed that now you're laughing to the bank, you definitely need to take some drastic revision measures at your film production plant, before it's too late.
