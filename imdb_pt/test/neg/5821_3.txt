I saw this movie at our crossroads movie festival, and I was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starring Karen Black. I was seriously disappointed by the awkward writing that never flowed and by the apparent lack of effort of the actors and the director to understand anything about the culture they were striving to portray. How did Lee and Griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which one was fucking the girl under the tree? It was not clear. And, there seems to be some law in Hollywood about the southern accents, and you rarely hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south, despite the terrible, "this should be how they sound, just soften the" r "approach to dialogue, often the actors leave completely out. Aleksa sounded especially like a New York street during "emotional" scenes, and no one looked like a Mississippian at all. The character of Walt Goggins should have been from the city of Morgan, Louisiana, but it did not look anything like the mix of new orleans and cajun accents of the city. The other annoying point seemed to be an impulse of the writer to make us feel that every man should have homosexual desires inside him. Before I started a firestorm here and I'm accused of homophobia, I enjoyed many gay-themed movies, notably "punks" "when love comes" and "b monkey." But this seemed to be the desire of some men over all young people. Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this ground and done a much better job. So, I wonder, if the Coen brothers may have regional accents and dead culture in movies set in Minnesota and Mississippi, why can not anyone else? What a waste of my time.
