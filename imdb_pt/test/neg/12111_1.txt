This thing, driven by the French sensation Patrick Sebastien, is worse than all the turkeys you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, The Patriot, etc ... you get the picture, this is the pits. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in France, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first movie, let's hope it's the last. I hope that Troma or someone would distribute this film in the United States, so that you can spy on the bad smell of France. Let's cut this short, this is S ** t's masterpiece.
