The spoof genre, which has been lacking in creativity and humor for some time, is spit on again by untapped hacks. No point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap dollars for the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It takes more than just referencing a few recent films and giving the characters double meaning names as satire; make people laugh. Any clod can pick up a cam-corder, and having some malicious friends in cheap costumes imitate someone else. Since the genre that is being targeted this time are the inspirational sports films, there are some useless references to such movies: jokes are so weak that characters have to emphasize references in various ways to make you laugh hysterically. Does not work. <br /> <br /> This is not comedy. However, the same old worn-out "jokes" ripped out of a high school bathroom (done even more gently than usual) are all here. If that is not enough, there is an ongoing "gag" of a bus running over someone. So funny, right? In addition, a pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unfounded results. A piece of music fails miserably. Pity Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, is now stuck in roles like this. <br /> <br /> Terrible beyond words. Watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this movie. Probably a lot funnier too.
