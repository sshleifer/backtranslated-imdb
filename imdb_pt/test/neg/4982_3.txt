Good things out of the way first: <br /> <br /> Underdog dubbing was FINE. But Jason Lee being incredible, this really is no surprise. <br /> <br /> Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also did well, because the garbage was given to him. He acted shockingly. And Patrick Warburton, the stupid assistant. Now he was a dumb character, but he acted very well, in fact I liked the character more than the protagonists. The lines given to him were childish, but spirited. <br /> <br /> However. Alex Neuberger did very badly and I hope he never acts again. His "Scream" was so disgustingly false. Silence. Silence. "aaahhhhhhh". In the scene in which he hears the dog speak, an "oh no, impossible!" would have been enough instead of the pathetic false cry. <br /> <br /> And then there was the girl and her bitch who chased Patrick's character, Cad on the roof. At first it makes sense, she's a "reporter." A school reporter, but still an inquiring mind, regardless. But why, why on earth did she take her dog around? This was useless and the damn dog did not even say anything but a cruel "oh, underdog!" His presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason I give this movie a 3 is Barsinister, his help and his weak voice.
