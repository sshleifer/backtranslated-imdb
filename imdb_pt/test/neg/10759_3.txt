Although this series and the particular mini-film were very important at the time of the release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually poorly written with a weak cast. The issues at heart are extremely well portrayed, but it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when acting and script are not convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini-film). <br /> <br /> I also do not believe that this mini-movie or series has stood the test of time, since many of the scenes are quite laughable. The issues are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff can not completely help the cause of understanding problems in Britain in the 1980s.
