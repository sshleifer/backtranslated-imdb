We all know that the world is full of dishonest and deceitful horror films. Some of them can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, terrible effects and dubious dialogue. But Raptor, who might have been in the same league as the equally useless Carnosaur series, does not even TRY to have any pleasure in it. It's so poorly done, it's really unbearable even if you're just watching with the intentions of having a brainless day at home. Where do we start? Well ... the scenarios are pretty monotonous. My old drama group has created more realistic stages. Genetics labs look like they are from a university, and it seems equally unbelievable from the outside. (Even to cover up, why would you put yourself near civilization where people can easily hear dinosaur roars), while doctors do not do that ? It does not seem credible at all. Then on the list of complaints are the effects of the creature; Well, what can I say? Absolutely pitiful. Also, I think it's worth mentioning that a woman's breasts should be mentioned as an effect. Both main female characters obviously had boob jobs, and this reduces the characters, with one woman being a respected member of the police, while the other is the sweet innocent daughter of the city sheriff. The acting, however, is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts may be excused for at least trying a little to give something to his role. This is where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed her costumer for making her lackluster performance seem even more pathetic, while the female protagonist seems so bored (though with this movie you could leave her off). The other character I'm going to point at is the daughter, who lets her boobs do all the acting on the "cheeky" sex scene (Ten minutes of endless scenes of her re-running jumping over some guy). <br /> <br /> All in all, and summarized as one. Do not bother, just do not bother.
