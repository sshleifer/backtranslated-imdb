Directed and written by famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr, using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) in the lead role of Glen / Glenda. This is an almost radical documentary on transvestism; The wood itself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. It seems that there are miles of footage and an incoherent Bela Lugosi is used to stretch this strange and strange film for 67 minutes. Police inspector (Lyle Talbot) seeks the illumination of a psychiatrist, Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), to better understand the emotional and the disposition of the transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Wood's sister, Evelyn. Note: Farrell also acts as narrator. Later, Fuller helped write songs included in the Elvis Presley, BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS and KID GALAHAD films.
