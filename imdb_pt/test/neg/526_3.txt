I finally got a DVD copy of this production and was curious as I had read so many people praising it to heaven, particularly Mrs. Lovett's Angela Lansbury portrait. I saw Tim Burton's movie a few months ago and I thought it was too bloody exaggerated; fortunately this version is not so horrifying but suffers dramatically in many other ways so that it is at least satisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the cast. George Hearn is appropriate and at least shows some expression (as opposed to the endless wooden face of Johnny Depp in the film). Angela Lansbury is simply annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to show the point instead of the voice of Helena Bonham Carter and the small-minded girl, but the subtlety seems to be just a word in the dictionary for Mrs. Lansbury. No one can be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends all the time assaulting and blinking in a "look, Mom, I'm acting!" fashion and be very aware of the public. This is not something that is typical of theatrical productions, God knows - I have regularly participated in many productions at Stratford Festivities for many years and stage actors DO NOT behave that way as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular jobs do not !) ... <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslyn. Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby. Has anyone besides me realized that she can not sing this role even vaguely properly? And she's playing George Hearn's daughter is just weird, considering she was married to him at the time. Should not she be a sweet sixteen-year-old girl? Yes, I realize that this is what the acting is, but not once did she convince me that she was younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase "mutton dressed in lamb" seems to have been invented just for her. His "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" massacre made me grind my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player immediately. This song was so well done in Tim Burton's movie, and that was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a soprano boy. Any vibrato kills her, and Joslyn spent all the time shaking so hard that I thought she was about to fall from her ladder because she was so shaken with the effort of holding the coloratura notes in a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let's go over her show by vibrating at least a quarter of a note in at least three of the highest notes ... This is simply not a coloratura role and maybe a shrewd director should have told her that - but the fact that She was married to the star and could have tied the director's hands. Cris Groenendaal was appropriate but again obviously too old for the role and there is no chemistry between him and Joslyn, which makes the entire subframe fall flat completely. I remember some of the earlier theatrical productions of the Wagner cycle where, because of the vocal force required for the singers to scream at the sound of a complete Wagnerian orchestra, they would have to launch based on the ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance. or acting ability or even a good voice, and that's why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and fascinating. The cast of the "juvenile" clues is exactly so - if you close your eyes, you may almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is broken. (And at no time can you believe in Mrs. Joslyn's Johanna ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost, because three of the four main characters were so obviously mischievous. I can not give a proper review of anything else because they were so upsetting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can not understand why people get excited about this poorly flung and self-conscious footage of a play. Surely there is more camera work in the cinema than just putting a camera in the front row? If I want this, I go to a decent piece, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for production and are not constantly attacking the camera. I give three stars just because the quality of production beyond the wiles of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> Probably the best thing you can do is buy the movie soundtrack and a recording cast of this game and then combine the two to make a whole bearable. This is what I'm going to do and try to forget that I bothered to rent this totally normal production.
