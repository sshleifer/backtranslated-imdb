There were two things I hated about WASTED: The direction and the script. I know I'm opening up for ridicule, but Stephen T Kay's direction is very much like ... as a ... as well as a MTV pop video. It is filmed (I think) in digital video against an intrusive soundtrack, often out of focus and often with fast transverse cut. If you are not a teenager, you will find many unwashed WASTED segments due to the stylistic approach. As bad as the direction was the script that ripped off my chain. The story is told through Samantha, a poor and rich girl who spends much of the film talking by voice (Strange how the narration never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character) telling us about the pressure of her exams. pressure of life at home, her social solitude and all that has led her to take drugs. Is it for similar reasons, such as separation of parents, that her two male friends (I thought she should be alone?) To start taking drugs. Oh poor Sammi in your beautiful home and your troubles as my heart bled for you and your friends - NO. What WASTED does not mention is that it does not matter what someone is addicted, be it drink, drugs, nicotine or chocolate that one has to work to become an addict, they are not victims of external forces, they are committing an act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING have demonstrated this very well, people become addicted because they want to. To portray them as victims in any way is wrong, paternalistic and quite possibly dangerous. By the way, if MTV is anti-drug, will they stop playing videos of stars that freely admit to taking drugs?
