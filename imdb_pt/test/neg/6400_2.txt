This occurs on Fire Island in the 1970s. A couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) are giving a 4th of July party at their home. Unfortunately, their relationship is crumbling and they have to prepare for a house full of very strange guests. The rest of the film tells the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay man, but I was 8 when this was done. If this is a true view of gay life in the 1970s, I'm glad I'm not around. From the intriguing opening credits showing children playing in the sand (???) this movie slowly slips into disaster. There is a guru (Robert Case) who talks nonstop about nothing of importance. I wanted to gag the guy in the middle of his first speech. There's the young kid Danny, who's there for the first time. There are the couple of lesbians (who do nothing - except a strip for no reason). There's the leather queen. Worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We are introduced to him and his friend (whose name I never bought) when they get a flat tire. They basically yell and scream for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix an apartment. I know some people find it funny, but I find it offensive and very sad. The party itself is full of people you would never want to meet. It's like being dumped at a party full of bad guys playing with obnoxious people. With the sole exception of Dudley, no one can act. <br /> <br /> This may be valuable as a picture of what the Fire Island was like back in the 70's ... but it's a rather monotonous sight. This only makes a 2 for the frequent male nudity of some very beautiful bodies.
