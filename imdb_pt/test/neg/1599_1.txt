This is supposed to be the life story of a man named Wirey Spindell from 8 to 36 years old told in the narrative by the character at every age in his life. So, for example, when he's eight, it's the eight-year-old voice that's doing the narration; When he is in high school, he is the one who does the narration, etc. That's the only interesting thing about this movie. It seems that every actor who plays the character is a separate character. Not only are they not alike, but their life experiences do not match. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a cold.
