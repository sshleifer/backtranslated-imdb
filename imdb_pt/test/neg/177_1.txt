The movie is boring. <br /> <br /> Technically, you often see blurry and much more edited scenes. One can easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and $ 100 video editing software. Down to earth, the man on the street does not mean sloppy editing. Blurred scenes that do not contain important instructions should have been deleted. The same goes for ensuring that the head / hand / other of the object remains on the frame. My 8 year old knows this now. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The main point (anti-globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why bother with everything else. After the interview with James Suckling, I pressed the "stop" button. What a period of time. <br /> <br /> The main theme does not work for me anymore. I have seen many small wineries that produce mediocre and marketed wines and many large wineries that produce excellent and unique wines. The film identifies small producers as those who are producing wines with more identity, or terroir. The largest are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of shades of gray. However, the film did not prove this statement. They look at some sporadic examples, "tie" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism, and provide "interviews" with key people. Well, did all the small producers spend World War II on the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has something with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
