I must start by saying that this is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen in my life! Number One Irritating Factor: Never seeing the "son" face (for the entire movie). And the infinitely more annoying factor: That incessantly ringing phone..nothing, but listening to the phone ringing repeatedly and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and new ... you get my point. The old man was being harassed, but VIEWER was too! At first the film was interesting to me, but it deteriorated very quickly. The movie may have been good as a short, but definitely not enough to keep anything approaching the size of the movie. I think what I'm trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally appeared during the last two scenes of the film) is secondary to this old man being harassed. Who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man gushing obscenities at a joke of someone calling him? If you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and takes you CRAZY ... check out this one!
