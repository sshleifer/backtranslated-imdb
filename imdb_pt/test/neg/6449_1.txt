This horrible piece of guts is everywhere. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are some decent actors (Charles Durning, for example), but the director did not get any of them. The plot has Santa Claus, feeling down and thinking that no one else needs it, taking a little girl across the country to try to recover the father with his mother. Includes a con man in a Santa Claus outfit with a plush parrot on his shoulder (played by "Isaac" of The Love Boat), the greatest elf in the world (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man but without an actor) hardened owner a factory that works its employees on Christmas Eve, and a sled race where someone cuts one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the plot looks bad, it's worse on the small screen. If you see this movie coming, run, do not walk to the television and disconnect it. You may want to boil your television to remove any remaining infection. If you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this, you may need to record your television and have the cabling company install completely new lines.
