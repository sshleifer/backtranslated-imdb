This is your typical junk comedy. <br /> <br /> There is almost no laughter. There are no genuine moments. There are no memorable lines. No scene where you think, "That was clever." Anything. The plot is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to look at and annoying as hell! There is no substance here. This movie has nothing. It does not matter if Farely was in it or not. A filthy movie is a fucking movie, no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> In addition, David Spade is a terribly bland comedian who plays the same bad character in a movie / TV show he has seen. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. It's no fun. No intelligence. There are many more "dumb" comedies than this one. This movie is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
