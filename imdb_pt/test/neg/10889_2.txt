This movie is not a horror movie. There's nothing scary about it. It's more of a torture movie. And that does not make sense to me, there are some scenes with bodies disappearing. For example, the woman at the beginning of the film. Who turned away Returns to a scene in the bathroom with Nicole And she and she disappears completely. So she kills the cop to put him out of his misery and he disappears MORE had to shoot his head twice to kill him I do not think so especially when you can see his head half blown and did not kill him? In the end she sets the killer's truck on fire. That, but he is not in it. He is standing behind her. Then he cuts the rest stop was completely refurbished and some people are in the resting area and a new girl arrives and Nicole on asking for help as the first girl totally meaningless in this movie. Save some money and skip this movie.
