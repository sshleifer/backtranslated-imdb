and totally non-scary movie. The characters do not matter, and most of the time is spent in a car. The dog is, at best, ugly, never really scary. To interest you, a more menacing threat would have been necessary, at least some people that you like and evokes some emotions in you. And, not least, something interesting should happen. Something unexpected. So, this movie just creeps on in what seems to be forever. Perhaps a Saint Bernhard was not as clever to choose as the terrible threat to life and society? <br /> <br /> In most scary movies / thrillers / mystery, any genre, there must be characters that interest you and make you want to know what happens. Here you really do not care, you just wait for everything to stop, and wondering if it would be better to see something else. One of the king's weakest adaptations.
