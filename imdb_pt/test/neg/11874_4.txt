Since Wesley Snipes came down (or Ascended) to the world of DTV action movies, the result was Miss, so-so and miss.Unstoppible was weak.7 seconds was fun. The shooter was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank. <br /> And what about the detonator? We will anything would be up suffering the Marksman again. But the detonator holds a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a not-so-by-secret-secret opponent who bursts illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his last task ends with a buffet of bullets leaving a pile of bodies, Sonny is ordered to accompany a witness; Nadia (the always hot Silvia Colloca) to the USA. Sonny is being fooled by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his track hot for Gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions. Snipes delivers in the action department. He's in half-blade mode here. well into the first 15 minutes of Detonator, before descending into pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the Marksman. Colloca does more than look beautiful. There is some conviction in your scenes. Many actors seem familiar, and have been in the last 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipes movies. It's always nice to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> The action is telegraphed here.But never boring.Running, car chases, fights.Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have gotten better after the Seagal farce; Out of Reach. It does a credible job. But it's constantly hampered by low budget. Enough with Eastern Europe. It's cheapening the look of the movie. Vancover can not be that expensive can it? The Detonator ends up only on average. There's not that bad your funny look about Seag Al 'Mercenary for Justice. But it's not nearly as much fun as Van Damme's second in command. It's not as exciting as Dolph's Mechanik. Maybe Dolph should drive Wesley next, huh? <br /> <br /> Your Time Producers pump up a little more money and think of those DTV titles with the kind of money they're making from them. It's just fair. The result could be a loud salesman, perhaps? <br /> <br /> Snipes would be advised to try to make this his last DTV action movie. It's sad to see yet another waste of talent from the talented actor.
