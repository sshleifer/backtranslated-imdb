The incomparable Paul Naschy, icon of Spanish horror films, lends his talents to this entertaining, if not non-dispersive, movie. What begins as an action movie ends in a horror story. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy plays a cold-hearted killer hired by some Japanese diamond hunters (one of whom is his flame carrying his son). ) to steal a diamond cache from a Belgian entrepreneur. When the action is done, the fascination of diamonds is very tempting for Paul to dispense, so he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, swears revenge and chases Paul through the forest, shooting him and leaving him to die. However, Paul is found by a moron with two horny girls and taken to his property to recover. <br /> <br /> On the property, the two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, fight for Paul in their weakened state, with the busty Silvia Aguilar determined not to lose to the sweet and cousin Azucena. But things get complicated for Mr. Naschy, who begins to see the ghost of his daughter's late mother on the estate grounds. Couple this with the Japanese girl who is trying to end the work of killing Paul and he is pulled from two sides. The script creates a fight for Paul among the daughters, but Silvia, whose character seems assertive and volatile, simply lets Azucena win in the draws of Paul Naschy without a fight Personally, I would have preferred the spooky story of the apparition to revenge in search of the Japanese woman) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You have shootings, an exploded baby and pigs eating a Gore's dogs will not be disappointed with this Naschy movie). <br /> <br /> AGIR: $$$ (Paul Naschy, as always, is fun to watch, but he spends a lot of time in bed recovering from his wounds.) Starring with him again are the sexy Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who teamed up with Mr. Naschy on the little gem "The Craving." Both girls do a good job). NUDDADE: $$$ (You have very brief glimpses of both Aguilar and Hernandez, but they are strategically placed, keeping the pieces of nothing covered.) Total nudity is provided by two less attractive actresses: the Japanese chasing Paul and the African maid who works for Silvia and Azucena).
