This tale of terror takes place in the desert of Namibia, Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow) is sent on a mission to a diamond mining company. Although he hates fieldwork, he finds himself in a truck with an open desert rescue unit battling with sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found ... well, what remains of their scattered bones is discovered. During a long, cold desert night, a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when the truck is stranded and the unit members are dying horribly, one by one. There is no character development; much less dialogue to speak. The desert in its own way is beautiful and reveals nothing ... the creature is as old as the sands of the desert. Also in the cast are Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai.
