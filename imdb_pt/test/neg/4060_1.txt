] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of directors DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, which include MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM. All great documentaries that I recommend. Watching this boring and foolish account of the Depeche Mode tour in 1988, I realized that they had nothing to work with when they released the film together. The band members were certainly less close to the camera; So no doubt the contest to add fans on a week-long bus trip was added to liven things up a bit. Really, now, I mean, come on. Who thought that a concert film by a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? Granted, I like the music of Depeche Mode, and Martin Gore writes good tunes, but seeing them in concert never seemed to be interesting, and this movie is a positive proof. Unless you're a big fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary ... it's a complete waste of time.
