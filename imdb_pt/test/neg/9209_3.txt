The film begins with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman finishing his lunch at a neighborhood diner. It looks like he does not have enough money to cover the check. Instead of picking up his plastic, he glances around to see if the coast is clean and leaves the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) was watching him from the other side of the delicatessen. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is adorned in what has gone by cool in the 80's with a brunette cut page boy. She follows him to let him know she saw what he did. He tries to deny it, but he can not escape her accusation. Thinking he's in it, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says she does not work for the deli and then offers him a ride back to work. <br /> <br /> When she heads in the opposite direction, she starts jumping down the middle Atlantic coast. <br /> <br /> We should get excited when the modern "Lulu" puts Charlie in humiliating situations. It's all right when the two consenting adults get a little perverted in a motel room, but discouraged when they dodge paying the check at a family-style restaurant. Stealing the work of hard-working people is not my idea of ​​"wild." Charlie's an idiot. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is an idiot. She begins to pass on Charlie as her husband. First to her mother (who cheerfully tolerates the riddle) and then to her 10-year meeting conveniently timed (an event later used by another very cool film for her own film "Grosse Pointe Blank"). The "marriage" is a surprise to the real husband of Lulu (Ray Liotta) who has just been released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives them both a welcome surprise and shows them how the crime is really nasty. <br /> <br /> I can not add any irony in writing that I first saw it by sneaking into the movies. No, I do not do that sort of thing. I recorded this from cable TV and I guarantee that I see it strictly in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br /> So I started to think because I recorded when I did not like it very much and I conclude that 20 years ago I was in a reggae kick and the soundtrack of "Something Wild" featured in reggae. The final credits begin with Sister Carol's treatment, running her version of "Wild Thing."
