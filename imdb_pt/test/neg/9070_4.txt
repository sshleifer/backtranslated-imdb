Attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner (as Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) arrive at the scary mansion of actress "Lorna Love" (actually the home of silent movie star Harold Lloyd). Wagner and Jackson are hired to write the biography of the silent movie star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project, since his father was once a lover of the famous star. Mysterious events unfold, and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, who is "perfectly preserved" in a crypt on the property; In addition, the bad woman seems committed to owning her husband and murdering Jackson! This is much more a variation of "Night of Dark Shadows," co-starring former "Dark Shadows" student Kate Jackson who knows and does her part well. Robert Wagner does not have the intensity of David Selby. Sylvia Sidney (as Mrs. Josephs) avoids Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is no match for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good in a part that would have been played by John Karlen (in a production of Dan Curtis). <br /> <br /> There is soft cameo from Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour. . The delivery of Lamour resembles Joan Bennett, which raises the question: why producer Aaron Spelling could not get over regular regular "Dark Shadows"? Director E.W. Swackhamer was the husband of Bridget Hanley; he worked with Mrs. Blondell on "Here Come the Brides," and with Jackson on "The Rookies." "Death at Love House" has undoubtedly a tighter plot than the movie "Night of Dark Shadows"; differs in the angle of the movie star; and in his final "Father Eternal Fire", more resembles the TV series' "Laura the Phoenix" plot. <br /> <br /> Death in the House of Love (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
