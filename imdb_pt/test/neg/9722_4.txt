The TV ads for this movie showed the wizards hitting a front truck, then being crushed and retired on the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the overall style of the movie was weak. This is the TV series "Enchanted" with three boys instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan that is to get them and consolidate all their power. In addition to driving in trucks, these children can fly around the sides of the houses, out the windows, push each other into piles of garbage, and cause the veins in the neck to burst. But if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and weak. The father of one of the boys is proof of this because he is sitting in an attic made to look like a mummy, but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good wizards are each rich in their own right, thoroughly spoiled, nasty and annoying. In any public school these children would be beaten every day. His facial gazes and ticks did not cut any mustard with the hood boys. Unfortunately for all good people, these Charmed boys were sent to the Hogwarts Reform School for wizards who could not enter the Harry Potter class. <br /> <br /> So, what was the movie? Three teenagers acting with each other and their girlfriends. Another teenager who envies his power and money and who happens to be a lost relative. After some scenes where the Charmed boys exhibit their powers and have sex with their girlfriends; the film goes back to the revenge plot of the unknown wizard teenager. Predictable stuff happens. The evil wizard ambushes several friends of the other wizards and eventually begins to attack them as well. The final confrontation happens, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you like to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins then this is a good movie to watch.
