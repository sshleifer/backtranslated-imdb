This movie was horrendous, it was kind of accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls, but they just did not come ... I waited for almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows ... they just did not come ... Instead, it's just an idiot wandering a dead cornfield with a camera. It's a mix of Blaire witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that as of October 23, 2005 they started filming a sequel, please do not be fooled by the box, even if it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest is not the gate of the lions bought the rights of corn: the film and had the brilliant idea of ​​casting it as the sequel to the original dark crop, which I found funny ... the only thing they had in common was that they were both filmed in a cornfield ... WILLLLLL movie does not scare you like the first, so stay away !!!!!
