Let me first start with the obvious: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the death of millions of Jews. That said, the problem with this film is that it sees the United States - probably the most welcoming society of all Jews outside Israel - as a place not unlike Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the film is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he gets to wear glasses!. A series of very unpleasant things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, his neighbors avoid him, all ending in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's pious and paternalistic novels, the kind that gave liberalism a bad name.
