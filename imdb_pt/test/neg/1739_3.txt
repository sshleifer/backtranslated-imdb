OK, let me start by saying that this is not a horrible movie by any means. It is not good. I remember a poster saying that acting is not exaggerated, it's just nuanced. No. I've seen nuances of Japanese and Asian acting. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This is the camp. <br /> <br /> The characters are totally unfriendly, the killings are totally random and totally meaningless. The writing is bad. I'm fine with the suspension of disbelief, I'm fine for not having everything delivered to me in terms of plot. But this movie has no plot. One critic stated, "This movie is set in a small town where people are going crazy in vortexes and spirals." This is not a synopsis, this is the whole movie. Congratulations, I just saved you an hour and a half. There is nothing more for that. No character development, no plot development, no explanation, no resolution. And not even the lack of resolution "Acceptable within the realm of J-Horror". Just nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musical score is made by someone who was obviously not actually watching the movie at the time because it is random enough to cause a whip effect. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and well done, it may be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems as if the score was designed to go along with another film. <br /> <br /> The best example I can It's as if the Japanese re-created Evil Dead without any of the smart parts or good performances. It just falls flat. It's J-horror without the horror.
