Being an explosive melodrama non-stop and non-stop, this film is one of the worst action movies ever produced, and absolutely unbelievable in every way. The rhythm is constantly agitated, and all the action and the actors are dominated by the total hysteria. It is almost unattainable, and a stain - or rather a stain - on the careers of all involved. The over-exaggerated attempt at excitement weakens, resulting in a movie where you simply go "Come on!" all the time. Scenario and events are impossible to be done remotely seriously. I can only evaluate this abomination of 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid movie, see Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and completely captivating. All Armageddon is not.
