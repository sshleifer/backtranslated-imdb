Nowadays, Ridley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and he can command huge sums for directing movies - especially since he has films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER as credits. So from this partial list of his credits, it is obvious that he is an incredible talent. However, if you look at this initial effort he made in film school, he would probably have trouble saying that he was destined for greatness. This is because, although it has a good camera work and style, the film is hopelessly monotonous and uninviting. However, considering that it was not intended for general release and was only a training ground, then I am willing to regard it charitably - hence the score of 4. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is part of CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. In this DVD are 16 short. Most are not great, but because it contains THE HEADLESS MAN, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an incredible DVD for lovers of short films that are worth buying.
