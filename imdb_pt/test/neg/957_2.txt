POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I was anxious to see them together, being married and all, I wanted to see their chemistry on the screen. Okay, that being said, I think the fact that they are actors, their relationship offscreen does not have to permeate their performances, especially with that script. <br /> <br /> How stupid can a collar teacher be? to anyone. I do not remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his protagonist, probably most inevitably. If I was "attached" to someone, I would be very angry. The passion that I would have definitely would have dissipated quickly. Meg showed not a hint of annoyance but a slight surprise. Dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. That whole part of the movie was so horrible - especially Meg having to go to the bathroom (# 2) among dumpsters in the dark at night. Ewww No way! <br /> <br /> What's with Dennis punching all the suspects in the movie? Half ask first afterwards. Not once, not twice, but often - I could have told if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film was the drama of Nick and his family. Too bad it could not have become more of the plot. The assumed off-screen drama that leads to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting from Dex's quest. <br /> <br /> My fault is the screenwriter of this script. Unless the director and others manipulate him in such a way that it is unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> I will not even understand the real reason why poor Dex was murdered. How ridiculous is that. Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained (a real "noir" moment), everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (Yawn) "Dex even says that this is a silly reason for a triple murder. Oh, the tension, you could cut it with a spoon." If someone other than Dennis was in that movie , I have to give half a star (just because I've actually seen worse) but in this case 1 1/2 stars. For Dennis and Meg stars, see nothing else.
