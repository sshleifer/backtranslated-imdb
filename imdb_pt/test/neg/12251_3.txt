Your idol will fool you into this movie. Stephen Nichols is unhappy as a young German student who still doubles under his father's orders, although the actor obviously appears to be almost 40 years old. This makes your relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) for a very young girl seem even more disturbing. The character has no dimension and the depiction of war serves only as a backdrop for this aspiring soft porn. Nichols, who is one of the best TV artists during the day, does not show any passion in what is the main interest of this film: to see him fucking again and again with this girl. It's like seeing two animals going there. If you're a fan of actor talent on other projects, do not rent that because you'll never see it the same way. If, on the other hand, you want to see Stephen Nichols having an orgasm in front of the camera, you might like: Stephen will show you his naked butt, a lot of tongue work, his groaning range, but not his talent like this character who is obviously as focused on sex and wicked as he was about wanting to do personal things in front of the camera. He may have found kinky but I did not - a GREAT mistake!
