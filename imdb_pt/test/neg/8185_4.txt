On the opening night of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was very excited to see movies that are historical and not very common. The guest speaker who opened this film has created a sense of hype about obscurity, and how this film is underestimated. The science fiction part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but I'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown shortly after the Brilliant 1928 "The Wind" or if it looked like Russian filmmakers after that romance Russians are famous (hundreds of characters, entangled tangles), but I know for certain that the dramatic parts, as in parts of the Earth, made no sense, were boring and I got lost in about twenty minutes. Maybe it was the acting, but I was convinced that this film is "unknown and underestimated": it's annoying, there is no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible. This is certainly not a "Battleship Potemkin", however, I will say that Russian films do not make a real effort to reminisce about what life is like in Russia.
