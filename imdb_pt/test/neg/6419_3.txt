A college classroom exercise class was filmed and released as a movie? The stereotypical stance and stylized maneuver of a horror novel for people who do not like horror movies, but wish they could tell their friends that, yes, they saw a horror movie. He even introduces novel music. <br /> <br /> Do books that fall from the library shelves scare you? Do the closing doors terrify you? So this movie is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When you were raped, was it simply ignored, because the rapist was the cool kid? What is scary is not this film, but the world view of this filmmaker. <br /> <br /> And the little twists are not even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie before, who do not want to see one now, and who want to see another movie about everyone conspiring against the weird kid.
