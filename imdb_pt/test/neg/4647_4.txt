The film opens with beautiful landscapes of the northwest landscape. Fenceposts spewing from fluffy earth, a freight train crossing hay fields in the distance, waves of clouds, small structures at the side of the road, a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere. Over this he plays a languid but mysterious arrangement of twin peaks piano and is all suitably moody and atmospheric in an American Gothic type of way. Through it, however, director Jon Jost keeps entwined clumsy pictures, block letters, opening credits with annoying sounds, colorful pictures that announce "BLUE", numbers that tell the "12 Steps to a Conclusion" announced in the opening credits . It is obvious, in the first few minutes, that although Jost is more than capable of capturing the landscape and the environment, he does not care. He has neither the affection for the open Pacific Northwest extensions Terrence Malick makes in Badlands nor the time or inclination of Twin Lynks David Lynch to weave mystery and intrigue around a particular location. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is more of Jon Jost's frustration with experimental tricks that serve his own purpose. The use of split screen is interesting, I particularly like, as we have the first image of Ricky Lee divided into two, one is counting childhood memories that matter only to him, the other is cursing and banging his head against the wall Throughout the film, the second Ricky Lee prevails, the laid-back, sexist hipster with the shadows that is hopelessly self-involved and stupid. On the other hand, stop motion animation and the choice to play most of the movie in voice narration do not work. Sometimes it does this because Jost writes as well as filming static scenes from the small American town Nowheresville, but Beth Ann's monologues, broadcast in the flattest nasal monotony imaginable, a voice that sounds like Stephen Hawking's computer-speak program crossed with a horse whinnying. so irritating to the ear that it kind of nullifies the purpose of trying to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Each couple tells us about their past experiences, their little triumphs and follies and doubts and past relationships that have come to nothing. They say very little to each other and what they say they say with expressionless faces. But they clash like rabbits. This seems to be their only open channel of communication, perhaps the only one they can rely on with any security. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in the Frame among the naive and delirious, those drawn by an American Dream have soured, but he does not stand above them. He is not condescending or presumptuous in his interpretation. They may be mistaken, but they are graced with moments of humanity, strange as they may be. We are called to empathize and show affection instead of pointing and laughing. This is the most successful FrameUp. the characters of the film come alive even when their blank faces do not stay, even as Jost gets in his way with his formal framing and intriguing camera games. <br /> <br /> So we go back to complaining angrily about the destructive effects of the money thrown on a picture inserted from a dollar bill, we have a strange psychedelic sequence where the Jost camera slides under large leafy trees that soon turn red as Beth Ann repeatedly reflects on the "sequins" in the narration, we even got a sudden turnaround toward plot and genre as the couple of Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, small town losers with nowhere to go and nothing to keep them back to their dead-end lives, arrive in California and decide to steal a 7/11. The film does not rise to an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of 7/11 work, as one might expect from a 'par-on-the-run' road movie, it slowly screams until it stops and you look out the window to see what there's really no place in particular. Parts of the ride were hypnotic and almost touching and funny, but everything else has been very annoying.
