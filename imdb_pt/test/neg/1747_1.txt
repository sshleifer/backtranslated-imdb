Although the acting was excellent, I spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to so many characters, to have his final enemy, and instead all suffered except him, and he got the job of the husband of who's the wife. death he causes by running away from his friends, beats the girl that he overdosed and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect fails completely to return to his cause. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark movie, because every character that is affected suffers an endless depression. None of the normal pathways to relief seem to be effective and the only thing authorities seem to do is to distribute amounts of stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland now, I will never go back in case I get affected by an amoral butterfly and end up as destroyed as the characters in this movie.
