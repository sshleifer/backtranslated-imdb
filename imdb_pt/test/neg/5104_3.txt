Although I have seen and enjoyed films similar to this, which were silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS ARRIVING IN THE WORLD, I particularly did not like this movie. This was mainly due to the irritating and "artistic" way the director chose to film the film. Although POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style, this film used similar techniques with far less subtlety - in some places, the editing looked very unstable and amateurish. Also, and this was really annoying, the use of zombies during the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie really was over-the-top. What I mean by "zombies" is that, to illustrate how depressed and oppressed the Ukrainian peasants are, people behave like manikins in many scenes. And they remain so, immobile, for a long period of time, while the "bad" capitalists and exploiters of the masses pass. Gimme a break! This movie is a wonderful example of style over substance - and it's just a movie for those who like or can ignore excessive steering. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD for this movie is improved in some way if you leave the audio commentary. This makes the movie easier to follow and offers some interesting insights.
