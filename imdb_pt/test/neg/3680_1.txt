If they had a Zero of 10 I would go in. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed to take money out of the public. I do not know how movies like this are released on video or on paid channel. I'm disappointed with Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes, so I can not get mad at him. Only the person who listed you is the star. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot except Gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs. Why they were looking for the gates of hell only the director knows. They should keep this movie in Moscow and burn it by fire to keep all the homeless extras heated for the night. There's nothing more to say about this movie than all the other reviewers have written. I wish I could forget this movie, it hurts my brain.
