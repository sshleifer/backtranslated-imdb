I preface by stating that I am a big fan of JJL and not one of Patrick's. So I watched this to see her performance and of course, it was excellent. I do not feel that the director was suitable for the film, since several very bad choices were made: shooting angles, blocking, etc. If the director was trying to give a "realistic" feeling, they failed and lost good performances because of it. I almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far away from intense facial reactions - and often when the action depended on the intimacy of the main characters, the dialogue was slow and slow. This could easily have been resolved by cuts or changes in the angle of the camera. But the impression I had was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also had the impression that maybe the scenes were filmed several times and the energy coming from the actors was ... exhausted.
