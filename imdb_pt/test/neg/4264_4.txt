This film did not give Mr. Bachchan justice. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed with the movie and there was not much plot in it. In fact, this is the first movie I've ever been disappointed with with him in it. It starts with her coming home with her daughter and he is a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden she is washing. He's a sixty-year-old man who has nothing to do but take pictures of this girl. The movie does not make sense. The whole movie is about her chasing him and she telling him how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she does not get bored and the daughter finds out. I just did not think this movie was up to Bachchan standards. He's better than this movie. I always imagined him as an honest person and then I saw him in this movie and could not imagine him in that movie. The movie did not interest me. I could not wait until the movie was over. And you do not either.
