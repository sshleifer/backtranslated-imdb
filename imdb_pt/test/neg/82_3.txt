STMD! It's not a terrible movie, but it's completely forgettable. Lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in everything else, so it is likely that you will get out of sight with a headache or visual fatigue. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The essential free nudity for teen horror movies is there, of course, along with archetypal teenagers, but the whole movie does not fit. What was needed was a quicker dialogue and more ironic humor. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I usually give a nod to a movie based only on one or two scenes that demonstrate imagination or humor, but unfortunately are missing in this film.
