I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is reprehensible, vile and transparent. It works only at the level of the hate motif currently in fashion (and tired) of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film had been made about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, the outrage would have been palpable, and the film would have been labeled in all circles. As such, however, it is "OK" and "resourceful" because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage like this. <br /> <br /> And the rubbish really is. If you want to see a quality movie of a similar trend, find and watch or analyze "Badlands". Nothing good was done in "The King", which was not made better decades ago in that masterful film. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers note, the characters are almost completely undeveloped in "The King", the lines are a snooze, cinematography is dull. We have seen the tale of the sociopath done best 100 times. This movie is not suitable for attentive viewers.
