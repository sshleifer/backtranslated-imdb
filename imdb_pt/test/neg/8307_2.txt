What a terrible movie! The acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play, or a story-driven porn film. This is not porn in this movie, but there sure is a lot of free nudity! This is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film, one of the only things that saved him from receiving a rating on a star. There are also a million cops who die in this movie. Hardly offensive, since violence is so unreal that we can only laugh. But breasts come out and get exposed in the most surprising and hilarious moments, if you like really bad movies, check this out. This is a Bonnie and Clyde-like story where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge. This movie also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've ever seen rolling around naked!
