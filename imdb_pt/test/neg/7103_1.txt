Sometimes a movie can not be easily rated. Such a film is "Tank Girl", part cartoon, part comedy and part action movie. I'm sure somewhere there's an audience for "Tank Girl", but it's extremely small, maybe punk comic book readers. Most viewers will be looking for an early exit or living with the fast forward button. The only quality left is short bursts of humor "find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers," but these little moments of comic relief are greatly compensated by the second-level action sequences. There is no character development, the which is not surprising, since the source is a comic book. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid - MERK
