This was the most horrible movie I had to go through. 30 minutes in the movie and I could not take it anymore. Seriously, do not worry about it unless you're a sentimental nutcase or one of those pseudo-arty types who like that sort of thing so they can feel more educated. Boring, although the performance is good; The kid is just annoying. Some scenes are a little strange with very strange close-ups. I do not know why they made the whole movie in black and white, but any effect they hoped to have failed miserably. There was nothing to watch, and although it is a sad tale, supposedly, it is so stupid that it is difficult to feel any sympathy for the characters.
