I've heard some good remarks about this movie as being very bloody and scary, but it's neither. Obviously, the screenwriter wanted to make a scary horror movie, but at the same time inject some teen comedy to the young target audience. Scars and comedies rarely result in good movies, the same goes for MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> It's not really funny, or scary or overly nice on ANY other level. <br /> <br /> Approaching 39 years old I saw my share of horror movies. I've seen good and terrible things, but the crop of movies released these days is so frighteningly mediocre that I hate to watch them. The acceptance nowadays of bad movies like that is what really pisses me off. Let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70's, 80's and 90's, but they were considered as such then too. Today they are considered "good entertainments". Bollocks!
