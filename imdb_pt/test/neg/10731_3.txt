I rented this movie at the local video store one day, you know, the kind of box art movie that just catches up and tells you to 'rent me'. Well, if you see this bland movie at your store, keep walking. Fight the urge, rent a porn movie, because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film falls into repetitive murders and a tough cop stumbling, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). Want to know if the fast-forward function on your VCR works? Rent this movie and put your worries to the test.
