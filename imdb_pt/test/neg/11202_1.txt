Gordon Scott with his well-combed hair, hourglass figure and strange pidgin, English, has to be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on an equal footing with any fourth grade drama class. I've seen used car dealers in TV commercials who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the annoying Eve Brent) take the lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids, but Wow! The plot seemed OK, but the director should have demanded more from his actors. I realize that even the Weissmuller films have some flaws, but this one seemed so "low budget".
