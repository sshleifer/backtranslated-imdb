SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I've seen a lot of movies. I do not think I've ever seen a movie that I really hated. Son of the Mask ruined. Son of the Mask is so bad I will not even make a detailed comment like I usually do. In fact, I will not even write much. I think all of you should know that this movie is horribly awful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was amazing in Scream, but now this movie! In addition, this movie takes a SMO-CAN movie and turns it into this movie of goofy children that even children will not like. This movie also consists of a very rude humor. Like the woman's nose. She has a nose on her head and when she sneezes, white things come out of her nose. There is also an exorcist parody. Yes, a children's movie has an adult parody. Maybe they thought adults would like it. Frankly, it made the film even more tacky and rude. <br /> <br /> Here's the basic and stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets the incredible Loki mask and turns it into a cartoon dog thing. When Tim is paying more attention to the baby with special powers, the cartoon dog becomes a Wiley Coyote ripoff. So Loki takes the baby with incredible powers and Tim and Loki have a really cheesy lively fight. Tim is wearing the mask. Everything ends up happy. Too bad that this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the original The Mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey movie. This, basically, is not. Please, please do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake when renting this. I do not want you to make exactly the same mistake. I feel horrible about not being able to write a detailed comment, but really, what's there to comment on? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I'd give one, but come on, it's basically a kid's movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: The Mask.
