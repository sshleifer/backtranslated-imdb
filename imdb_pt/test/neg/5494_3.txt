Although I'm usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although the film has some lovely moments, overall, it falls flat. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where's the set? Italy or an Italian troupe in New York? Why bother to make a historical movie if it does not convey a scenario? If you want to see a well-made and inspiring historical movie about theater as well, check out Tim Robbins' The Crackle Will Rock. This film has many advantages, including an excellent performance by John Turturro.
