I am surprised that "The Hospital" has been so well received by critics and the public. I found it sad, visually ugly and usually nonsensical. After the first 40 minutes virtually impossible to watch, the movie improves (relatively), but continues to be much exaggerated (not to mention bland) to succeed as a satire, and has little substance to succeed as a drama. The uncertain tone of the film is his biggest flaw, overshadowing even Scott's incredible performance.
