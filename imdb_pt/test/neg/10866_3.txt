Larry Bishop is 60, dirty and does not look good STILL in this movie he's like a drug for women in their 20s. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been claimed as sexist, but if there is a movie worthy of that title, this is it. <br /> <br /> I can not even count how many breasts were shown in this movie, probably more than hours when Larry Bishop went on to write the screenplay. <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, Bishop and his gang argue, ride a bike, party, have sex, kill people and the next day argue, ride a bike, party, have sex, third day, well understood. /> <br /> I like ERIC BALFOUR and considering what he had to work on, he did very well as Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie is about the character of Larry Bishop, Pistolero, who is so one-dimensional that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to do the lead alone, but everyone he asked said no, so what would he do? Once he realized that he was going to make the lead, he probably did a rewrite of the script so he could retouch more women. <br /> <br /> Although visually beautiful, at least the biker scenes and Eric Balfour is not kinda bad, this movie is just a big mess. <br /> <br /> I hope I never see Larry Bishop in front of the camera again.
