I'm a fan of good and plausible action movies. And I'm a big fan of elite military units, like the Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, none of them allowed me to really appreciate this movie at the time. I gave it another shot more recently when I bought the DVD. Here are the problems with this movie in a quick list: 1. It is a poor man's weapon, for example, including a virtual video clip of the SEAL team playing golf with a soundtrack of "The boys are back in town" which concludes with Charlie Sheen making a chase to get his car back. <br /> <br /> 2. This is simply a Charlie Sheen movie when Sheen was trying to be famous before she started doing things like Hot Shots. The reports I've heard indicate that Sheen was a baby on the set and this has affected the roles and direction that the rest of the actors in the film have. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely obeys him. Any SEAL showing the lack of discipline that Sheen's character does, or that endangers the team like him, would not have been able to get through BUDS training, let alone have entered a team. <br /> <br /> 4. SEALs are crossed in arms. However, in one part of the film, a SEAL has to "figure out" how to use an American Stinger missile. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the movie. The assault entrance at the beginning, Bill Paxton as "God", and some of the filming in what was to be Beirut at the time. Overall though, this movie is a loser.
