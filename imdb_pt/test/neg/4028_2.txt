This whole movie is so terrible that it's a complete mess. The story is so stupid that I can not believe that anyone actually sat down and wrote about it and thought it would be a good movie! The acting is possibly the worst of any b movie ever made. I've seen many b-type science fiction films before and some of them are actually very good, some of them - like De Venus - should never have been made. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers think that just because they put something together and somehow got on the shelves of a movie store, that they accomplished something - which is good and that should be seen by people. This is not always true, and definitely not true in From Venus. This movie loses in all accounts: horrible acting, stupid plot, very weak special effects, ugliest costumes of all time, unrealistic dialogues, bad direction, etc. You can simply say that this movie took only $ 20 to make, and I may be giving a lot of credit there! I urge you to stay away from this train crash of a movie for your own good!
