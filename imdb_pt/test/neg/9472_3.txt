An old Roger Moore is back again as Bond, this time trying to figure out why Agent 009 was killed, and why he had a forgery of an Egg Faberge with him, and where he came from. He ends up in New Delhi, India, then East Germany, after discovering that a Russian general is trying to detonate a nuclear bomb in a circus, hoping NATO will make a complete disarmament, so that it takes control of Western Europe. Despite the way it looks, this is more of a romance, between Bond and Octopussy than an action movie, and even longer, but still a little fun. But there are many attempts at humor in this sense; sometimes it looks like it was meant to be a comedy. Also, Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in that, so there would have been a lot of age difference between Bond and Octopussy. Oddities: The small plane used by Bond following pre-credits is now hanging at a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater / Largo, Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ****
