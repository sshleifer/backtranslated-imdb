A friend of mine once rented this, thinking since Peter Fonda starred, it could not be bad. WRONG! It's as bad as anything can be. There's so much to laugh about and it's not the jokes. For example, in a scene, Hawken enters the forest and when he leaves, suddenly he is wearing a completely different outfit! Where was the director's brain when he filmed that scene? Probably the same place where Fonda was when he agreed to make this movie. It's really a shame that someone has to see a great actor get speechless with that poor excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> No one's performance in this movie can be called acting. Jack Elam is brought only to bring the count of stars here, but all he does is look scared in a very dark and terribly filmed scene in some kind of bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so wonderful that I wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine as well. If I could give a 0, I would. Shame this brand does not exist here. This really resembles a bad joke or an amateur shoot made just for fun. This should serve as a test of how B movies can get bad.
