First, the current description of the IMDb storyline seems misleading, the movie is about a group of girls picking up a misogynist hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he keeps them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. The violence follows. <br /> <br /> I caught this by mistake, thinking it was the other 2007 movie, "The Hitcher." Not that The Hitcher was any better, and I was looking for a bad movie to watch anyway, but that was almost unbearable at times. I think I might have vomited on a piece of paper and have a better plot than that. <br /> <br /> I can not even count how many movies I've seen with pretty much the same plot, so this was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it horrible were some scenes that ... well, let me give an example. At one point, a door is covered in blood (which is very obvious), and two policemen, on the spot because of a call to 911, are looking at her 30 yards away, see a man, also covered in blood, step out of the door, agrees he looks suspicious, but decides not to investigate further. <br /> <br /> But, ridiculous though it was, it was never boring, well produced, directed and acted, complete with good special effects, free nudity and violence. I probably would not really recommend spending 90 minutes of your life sitting to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to have while I clean my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies, and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan to do more conversations than watch.
