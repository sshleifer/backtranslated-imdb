A man kicks a dog in the air. A woman kicks a cow out of bed. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> A woman sucks a statue's finger for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a blind man in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Jesus rapes a girl. <br /> <br /> There you are. I just saved you an hour of your life. Certainly there are those to whom this "shocking avant-garde of cinematic expression" would be attractive. But I did not find it different from the puerile and disconnected videos that I used to photograph with my friends in 9th grade. Except we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> Having heard endless sermons from connoisseurs of the art of stroking the beard of how this is such an important film, I thought it would be worth my time. Make no mistake, that sucks. If I hear another person call Buñuel "father of cinematic surrealism," I think I'm going to punch someone. If anything, he issued a big step backwards from the pioneering surrealistic pioneer by his old folks Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F. W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years before. This made a joke about the whole thing, as if Bunuel did not have the confidence to really embrace art without sarcasm, sans l'absurdité. Buñuel would take another 40 years to perfect his style in something admirable. Ignore the starting material and go straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure he would agree. In 1977, Buñuel himself stated that he would be happy to record all the impressions of his old films. In this case I would be happy to spill the lighter fluid.
