Since this show was changed from TSS (the screensavers) to AOTS (show bout), it went down hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. It made the show incredible, so they were dismissed from the TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers and more about games and magazines. It also promoted bands that no one had heard or cared about. Finally, I could not watch it again, since Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went out to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online podcasts and shows, etc. on the REV 3 network. Check it out. REV3.com I think you can go to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show instead of a show then go watch Kevin Roses concerts or listen to the TW podcast. <br /> <br />
