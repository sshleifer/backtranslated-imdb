Wow, where do I start? After suffering for this miserable rental of $ 1.00 (thank you, Family Video) I just had to make some comments. I did not bother writing the names of the 3 actors in the movie, but I hope you know who I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster truck terrorizes the field and chases two college friends to its doom. They are faced with a hot girl wearing filthy clothes. I mean, that sounds fantastic in theory. I was laughing hysterically at the DVD box as I walked to the girl behind the counter in the store. <br /> <br /> Performance: The hot girl, played by Aimee Whatever, is visibly laughing through many scenes where she should be scared. The other two main actors in the movie, the fat prankster and the vanilla face are terrible. The fat guy thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. The other actor, our hero, exaggerates and loses all his tips and introduces himself as a generic character you can see in a Nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early '90s. Look: I do not expect great acting in movies like these, but at least the actors can make an effort not to be annoying. You may be an incompetent actor, but still be nice (eg John Wayne). At least that gal Aimee is attractive. <br /> <br /> Script: Holy ****, who thought this dialogue was funny? I would not dare to play this in front of my elementary school drama class, let alone a movie script. Unbeatably bad. More on that later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the only place where the movie definitely succeeds. The production quality is unbelievably high. The look of the movie is very good. Apparently, the only talented person who worked on the film was the director of photography. <br /> <br /> OK, here are my biggest complaints: 1) The guy who drives the car never drives faster than 40km / h. 2) The guy who drives the car is well off in the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in the back seat of him. He's supposed to be meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his old car in good condition, but does not he notice a 300-lb Jack Black impersonator in the back? Come on. <br /> <br /> 4) Characters never change clothes. There are two scenes of the hotel. Presumably, showers are available to our characters even during the 3 days that this movie takes place, none of the characters bother to change clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. The noisy and bland comedy does not mix with horror. Period. You can not leave our characters running away from a monster truck for a second, and in the next second, they face verbally with some dopey light / comedy music. This kind of rhythm virtually destroys any tension in the film. Films like Evil Dead 2, which mix comedy and horror, understand that tension can be released but never completely eliminated with humor. Monster Man does not understand. <br /> <br /> I'm annoyed that what could have been a VERY funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot smarter than he really was. Oh well.
