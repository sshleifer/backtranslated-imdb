There's something rotten in this movie, and basically the way he turns a sinister and distorted character into a hero, exploiting our sympathy for his admittedly horrible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, choose suicide. The fact that he's been contemplating this for more than 26 years probably worsens his condition, but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks, even if it means ending a life is, in my opinion, deeply wrong. What a contrast to the uplifting example of scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered a much worse condition for much longer! However, with morale turned upside down, the film reveals hero worship, and people who disagree are painted in simplistic and idiot terms. There is little room for subtlety, especially in the encounter with the priest (deliberately manipulating the real-life encounter that was with a much younger priest). That way, I suppose the film is on par with Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to take their life when they feel they can no longer live. It makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people who evidently believe that you have the right to choose. The same people will probably defend abortion. All this is part of the current tendency to let the suffering or the sufferers out of sight, brush it under the rug, Mom will say. OK, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. So we follow the slippery path of believing that some lives are not worth it, and then we will decide that as some people can not really decide for themselves, then we will bring the state to decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler straight from that other Oscar nominee "der Untergang". Hitler, of course, believes that he does exactly what nature does by eliminating the weak. Under his regime, there were forced abortions among the "weaker" strains, the mentally disabled were quietly put aside and the Jews were "humanely" liquidated using gas. He would have applauded this film, and because it is not in line with his philosophy ... "some lives are simply not worth it" I am different from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved in making this film Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and no one chooses to be born, then who can choose death, is not about religion, is about protecting the weak and helpless, something that this movie does a lot to undermine!
