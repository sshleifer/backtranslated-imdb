A critic of IMDb calls Eaten Alive a movie acceptable to the "knower cannibal." Are there such people? I did not know. But if you're one of them, hey, have a ball. The rest of you may find this buva a little hard to swallow (pun intended), even if, like me, you consider yourself a connoisseur of horror movies. I've been an avid fan of horror for about 15 years, although I've never made it to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and I think I owe my short-lived interest to these moan-inducing movies, oddly enough, to movies Chinese. total disrespect for copyright laws. You see, I bought a collection of two-disc DVDs from all Wesley Snipes movies for 20 yuan, which eventually included Last Cannibal World, Cannibal Gods, Eaten Alive, Cannibal Holocaust, Next Nicholas Cage, and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Good. <br /> <br /> Being a second sequel, I immediately had a feeling of dismay when the movie debuted with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around the major American cities, shooting unsuspecting Americans with venomous darts and then fighting at full speed. Having run out of ways to keep the scary movie cannibals, it seems now that they have gone to the mainland. Later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is in a "training exercise". Arrest your daughters! <br /> <br /> In a short time the film settles into the old routine of the missing sister, when a young blonde named Sheila begins her own investigation into the disappearance of her sister, who looks nothing like her, but is willing to spend most of the film naked, so I guess it does not matter. It seems that after shooting one of his victims, the unfortunate cannibal we met at the beginning of the movie, who was not used to life in the big city, ran onto the road and was hit by a moving van. <br /> <br /> The brilliant police force finds a mysterious film about him showing Sheila's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior, but beyond the film, the guy is a complete mystery. As the police chief laments, "we know nothing about him except that he is dead!" Poor boy, he must have a headache for all this. I recommend a nap. Luckily, Sheila is the kind of girl who can raise tens of thousands of dollars as if it were nothing in the search for her sister. Perfect for hiring a caricature of the backcountry guide, since the police clearly will not be of help. <br /> <br /> Obviously, nothing new is added to this tiny subgenre. Quite the contrary, cannibalism almost looks like a backdrop for a completely different kind of bad movie, about a missing person's rescue of the dangerous elements. Spreading the plot of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add a jungle cult of people following a guy named Jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to bring man to nature, a process which they call "purification." Personally, I'd rather just pee off once in a while. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the members of the cult - an obese guy who seems to have taken a three-day weekend. from the office to appear in this movie. When he takes his trusty medical kit to give him an injection, he warns her, "If you do not believe in Jonah and in purification (through pain), God help you." He then gives her a shot, and when she flinches at the little pinch, he apologetically apologizes to her. I feel like a true believer in this guy! <br /> <br /> In relation to blood, there are many unpleasant sound effects on random shots of animals being slaughtered and more than disgusting images of women being sliced ​​and eaten alive, so I think there the film does justice to your name. The acting is unbelievably bad, as can be expected, and, oddly enough, the editing is also spectacularly flawed, but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in totally insane cults to relate to anyone in the movie. There are an abundance of strange religious ceremonies that happen, which makes it increasingly difficult to understand why Sheila's sister has decided to turn away from normal society. I'm all for individualism and doing its own thing, but come on. <br /> <br /> After a while the film goes even lower in its basic escape movie, shortly before we witness Glory Hallelujah's most wildly indifferent performance in film history. WOW. <br /> <br /> Note: In this movie, a woman is raped with a snake cut. If you need any more reason to never watch it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
