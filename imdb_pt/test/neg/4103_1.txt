My friend recommended this movie to me. I should have known that I did not watch because my friend is a video game nerd. But the name and cape made it look good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean, first of all, what happens to your facts? And the acting! Looks like they took people out of Barney. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why was he in that movie? He thought it was a comedy! But I must say that the special effects were very good. But that was like the only good thing about it. I mean seriously, the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And this is really a euphemism. Everyone must have thought, "Oh, I'm getting paid, so it does not matter if it's the worst movie in the world." I would understand why anyone would do this kind of movie if they were directing, acting, producing, writing, and getting their best friend hopelessly filmed and edited. Probably one of the worst science fiction films of all time. A true movie
