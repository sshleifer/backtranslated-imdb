Being a big fan of horror movies, one of the hardest things to consider the lack of plenty of good movies in the genre, and having seen hundreds of them in my life, I have to say that the Dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired . , piece of garbage lame and poorly made I had the misfortune to see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! It's so bad it's not even laughable. The special effects (I said "special"?) Probably were achieved by spending a couple of grandiose, the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the bin after the first reading by the studio that decided to take on this miserable. project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also, for those of you who like nudity in your movies, do not be fooled by the R rating. If you're thinking that you get the chance to see Erika Eleniak even half-naked, you're wrong. She's fully dressed throughout the movie. And the cover art is completely misleading! There is no scene anywhere in the movie that does not even resemble the incredible cover art they put on the box to entice unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> Shame that the rating is only 1 to 10. I would give this movie a -10. Be warned. Do not waste your money or your time on this.
