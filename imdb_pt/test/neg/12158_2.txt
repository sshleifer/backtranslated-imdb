I watched this movie a few nights ago and it was horrible! <br /> <br /> Long time - despite having managed to spend most of their lives! Very annoying - the parts that included were long and for some reason the director chose to cut some of the action and left large parts of the movie unexplained! Very inaccurate - the 'mystic' side of this movie was a joke, and the last time I checked, Ghengis Khan was not exactly a cool guy! Very well represented - I found several characters difficult to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked depth! <br /> <br /> One saving grace from the film was cinematography. That's why I gave this movie a rating of 2 stars instead of the least! However, if you want to look something beautiful, I recommend buying a photo instead! <br /> <br /> In all this film was a waste of my time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give this Mongolian turkey a nostalgia!
