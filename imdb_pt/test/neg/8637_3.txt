When George Sluizer was told that he could direct an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei" / the movie "Spoorloos" (outside the Netherlands, this movie is also called "Vanishing"), he was informed that this would only happen if the end was changed - He was informed that "the American audience" would not approve the original ending. Of course the original ending is much better and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I've already put this in the trivia section, I'm not going to give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. If you want to know the original ending, watch "Spoorloos" or read the book. This movie is absolute rubbish, and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I did not like. Watch the original Dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
