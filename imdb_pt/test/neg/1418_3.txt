The premise of this film, from a comedian talk show host running the presidency as an independent just to shake things up, is funny, fun, brilliant and even a little inspiring. (I thought of the West Wing debate when Tom Dobbs left the podium, thought of Steven Colbert announcing his candidacy, good times.) The first 15-20 minutes of this film are therefore a lot of fun, especially the debate. When he eventually gets elected, it's a shame it's because of a computer crash, you'd like it to win (though that's not realistic). <br /> <br /> But after that, this movie goes completely down. I thought we would get a great movie like 'Dave' (1993) in which we would see what it would be like if a comedian really ruled the country. Instead, the film turns the comedy into a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does nothing good. Computer failure becomes the main story, which really sucks. Boy is this disappointing. I give him 3 stars just for the premise and because I really got to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing with me.
