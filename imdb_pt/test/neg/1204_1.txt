A teenage boy, who is not in the army and has not trained to be a jet pilot, takes off to a foreign country to rescue his father. If that is not ridiculous enough, he talks to an Air Force colonel to help him get his hands on a jet [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, the Colonel risks his career and life by giving the brave boy some help. They not only do not do colonels like this, but they never did. This cheesy and cheesy movie should be played in the air and taken by a MIG.
