This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta expert sent to Australia to fix Coca-Cola's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. The good performance of Roberts convinces us very quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so fragile, that whatever the development of a good character achieved, it is denied by gaps, inconsistencies, and sequences of absolutely boring movies. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a sucker for audacious and distant plots. Examples I like to include, "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". Coupled with the fact that I must admit that this film was well represented, it even surprises me that I can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The total collapse in this movie occurs in the middle of the film. All the comedy is instantly lost and the movie goes dark. Then the movie moves forward. The movie's attempt to make the comedy roll again is not successful. More surprises await the viewer and they are still darker. <br /> <br /> To be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. However, with this movie, the result is as successful as "new coke".
