OH MY GOSH! After such a promising start, Critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what goes on around. Clearly, very few things were thought out when this movie was made, and what was going on with Scott Grimes wearing an earring! This should have been the last expedition to the Critters saga, but more junk was on the way. That was the big reason why I did not watch Critters 3, and why do all bad movie series have to have an episode in space? (Critters, Friday the 13th, leprechaun in space, Hellraiser, etc.)
