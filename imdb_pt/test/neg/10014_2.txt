At the bottom of the Apocalypse movies scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner' .. at least from where I come. A guy is trained by a former cop to get revenge on those who killed his wife and friends in cold blood ... and that's about it. Many fake blasts and repetitive shootings happen. It has one of the strangest costumes I've seen in a movie for a while, and a huge fortress that is apparently only managed by 7 people. GREAT job in dubbing too guys! Best moment: when our hero loses a sword fight and is about to be stuck by the neck, he just takes his gun and BANG! Why not do this before? It's a mystery. That is why someone would want to sit with it in the first place. I'm still intrigued about it now .. 2/10
