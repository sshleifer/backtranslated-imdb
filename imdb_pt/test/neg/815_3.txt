Hard to imagine what they were thinking when they made this movie (ie writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 films, amuses himself with dozens of other actors who seem to have no more motivation than receiving a paycheck. I think there's nothing wrong with this, but once they get paid, that does not mean someone has to watch it. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that there really is good reviews for this movie here on imdb. Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery, do not watch this movie. Comedy? Watch a re-run of the Flintstones, on the same plot with less time wasted. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance, for better or for worse. And some of the young actors may have had good experience making this movie. But Plummer ???? It was embarrassing to watch his performance, in fact I was positively paralyzed in it throughout the film, knowing that this was Plummer of Sound of Music fame! I see from his biography that he called Sound of Music "mucus sound", so I guess he did not like it as much as the '100s who liked him in it. <br /> <br /> I wonder if today was asked, how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is, what would he say .....? <br /> <br /> Probably something like "Where the Money Is" ....
