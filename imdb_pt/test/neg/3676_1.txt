This movie is total dreck. I love Val Kilmer and was very surprised earlier this year with "Felon" (a good movie!). The entire DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer, being considered as one of the main people in this film, is in the film for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not entirely true. This could have been a good movie, but the direction was horrible and the plot was as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually, when a movie is horrible, you can sit and laugh at it. This movie is so bad and annoying that I actually fell asleep (which I never do during a movie). AVOID ALL THE COSTS!
