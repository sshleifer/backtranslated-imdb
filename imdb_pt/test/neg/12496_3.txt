Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the murder of a senator, but along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker in his tail. The tracker, by the way, is keen to finish Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action movie, of course Robocop and while the movie had some imagination and real energy, this only has a real life kickboxing champion running away from a robot. The movie is not as horrible as it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are created to be cut by the various shots. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrible in the lead role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (very bad)
