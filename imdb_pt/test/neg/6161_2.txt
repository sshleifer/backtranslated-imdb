This is a movie with a wonderful concept, but with a very weak writing. It should never have been released with at least three more rewrites (assuming you have one). The story is very little tied together, and there are many 90 degree turns in history to make it a cohesive film. It would be great to see what a decent screen writer could do with the story.
