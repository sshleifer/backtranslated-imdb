I work at the rental company that rents this video in Lexington and I must say that it should never have been done. I even know some of the people who worked on it who regret doing it. Bad effects, horrible acts, bad script, especially. I swear the dialogue would not have gone through the original Resident Evil PSX; It's so bad. If you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this movie to learn a thing or two. If not, do not waste your time. And even the director knows it sucks, because he keeps coming in to try to get us to make the movie bigger. No sir. I watched two-thirds of the horror section and this is even smaller than Plan 9 of the Outer Space. Even Ed Eood would have said, "No. That's very stupid even to me."
