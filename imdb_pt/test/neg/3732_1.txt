J.J. Jameson (of Spider-Man 2) Quote ... Shit, Crap, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Crap He pretends to be a tribute (unintentional) to the Coen Brothers ... done badly. <br /> <br /> There is no real mystery to the plot. <br /> <br /> Diaz's performance is totally uninspired. <br /> <br /> Peculiar characters do not really work. <br /> <br /> There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I love black comedy, but this movie is not funny. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was not worth the electricity. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in this genre that are so much more fun. <br /> <br /> Hope you found this comment useful.
