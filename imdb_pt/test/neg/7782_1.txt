Look no further, that's it, the worst movie ever made. There may be others that are tied, but there are none worse. There can not be. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on a $ 3.25 clearance, and I figured that no movie with these actors could not be worth that price. It turns out it's worth tripling this - as the least they should have paid me to watch it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie. film, they replaced someone else, someone younger and more handsome, to make it look more attractive. Whatever the "plot", there were about three minutes of actual film, the rest is filling. And I do not mean the kind of filler that you just realize is filling when it's over, or that it's some kind of eye candy that you do not mind having there, I mean, filling you're thinking of your shopping list. I think the "music" must have been invented by someone with a friend who had a radio that he heard once. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> If there were a picture of a beautiful mountain, a river valley, a forest, anything, there would be something positive about that movie. There is not. Even with the speeder button on the remote control, even at the maximum speed of the CD, it is not possible to recover it quickly enough. After years of thinking about commenting on movies being tempted but not signing up for IMDb, I finally cracked because I had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Guidelines call for you to "focus on content and context." I can not. There is not enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. Sometimes evil is bad, and this movie would have to be much better than aspiring to be just that.
