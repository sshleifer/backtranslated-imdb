A quick and fun ripening matinee that attracts the weaker villager of us all. It actually works as a vehicle for Justin Long, which subsequently erupted on our screens in the fourth ad Die Hard via PC vs. Mac, Dodgeball and The Break Up. He's funny, sincere and young - a great career ahead. <br /> <br /> A city worthy of college aspirants finds a fake website that Bartelby (Long) created to elude his critical parents and get down in "college" as it was a brief Facebook party. Lewis Black summarizes anarchic philosophy as a substitute Dean - Long delinquent friends provide support for subterfuge and consequent appeal to the grandest traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves a special mention for his unpronounceable contribution of slapstick). Well executed, I feel good and instantly forgettable. 4/10
