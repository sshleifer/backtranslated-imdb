Please do not waste six hours of your life seeing this as I did. The fact that I did is not a good reflection on me. The only rescue job in this clunker was Wes Studi. As a 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove is beyond me !! It was a disjointed story, disconnected and incoherent. The plot lines were not developed, the action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending (disappointment) was an appropriate ending to this miniseries. Val Kilmer, whom I consider a respectable actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen in his life. His final scene on the show had to be filled by the director. I have been reading these reviews for years and this show led me to sign up !!!
