This is possibly one of the worst movies I've had the unpleasantness of watching in my entire life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. The character of Ben Kingsley is simply stupid, but not funny. It's a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such a thing. Tea Leoni makes a great impression of Hillary Clinton to portray the very cold and uninteresting female leader who has all the captivating qualities of a broom handle. Throw in a useless and unexplainable sub-plot and a dignified assembly horribly shaken, and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
