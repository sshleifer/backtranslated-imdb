In the only common-sense act they have ever done, the NSW Film and Television Office refused to fund this film. The producers began to cry and in an explosion of publicity took their production to Victoria. In addition to the lost work for the technicians, NSW was fortunate not to get involved ... <br /> <br /> The film fails on almost every level. Postmodernism fails, the cast fails (what is the character of Rose Byrne? What the heck is the character of Pia Miranda doing?) And the story is a clich√©d confusion of contradictions. In fact, the story runs like a dragged prelude rather than a complete storyline. <br /> <br /> It could have taken a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was best thought out and executed. If the cast were weirder, if the style was less serious ... if things were different. <br /> <br /> In addition to the usual excellence in costumes, design and cinematography (like most Australian films), the film is just a total miscellany. With a reported budget of more than $ 7 million, "The Tender Hook" is a symptom of the malaise of the Australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are being funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (less than $ 2 million) or "Cedar Boys" (less than $ 1 million) and you'll get the idea. Hard and interesting films are struggling for funding, and fragile and overblown projects with famous names are making money. <br /> <br /> The funding bodies that invested in it deserve the same as the character of Hugo Weaving at the end of the film.
