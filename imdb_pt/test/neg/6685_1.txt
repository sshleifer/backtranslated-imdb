What a nasty cynical movie. Apparently, this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at the 20-year-old as they crawl through the Sydney nightlife gutter is supposed to be somehow connecting with their target market. Made by some of the industry no one and friends who apparently thought they could mend any despicable behavior with a young cast and dump it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed miserably at the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its representations clich√©s of obvious and easy targets that was totally rejected by the target public itself. Poor quality and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to young audiences that could have been attracted by the marketing or by the cast SAMPLE PEOPLE could have been interesting or even informative if not spoiled by their exploitative vision of what teens want to see in a movie '. The character played by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again wasted by producers of poor and untalented films. It's as if the producers thought that the teenagers would watch any ugly trash and only scenes and characters that were superficial and less soulful. Well, they were very much mistaken. A mini budget movie made in 1983 called GOING DOWN hit this topic and is an excellent antidote to this poison.
