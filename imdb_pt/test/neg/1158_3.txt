Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictional story based on the prison of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a series of horrific murders that sparked a wave of terror in his hometown in the late 1950s. His evil mind and twisted world are suspected to be caused by his zealous dominating Lutheran mother. Ed was nicknamed "The Plainfield Butcher." He would steal fresh tomb corpses from women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before "dressing them like a deer" in his garage. Heads cut off with bodies hung upside down are your personal trademark. After his arrest, there would be many articles made of human skin found in his house. In this film, a young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) makes a personal search for Gein (Kane Hodder), when the mother of his warehouse (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. The acting is far better than the ridiculously liberal account of the events documented on Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
