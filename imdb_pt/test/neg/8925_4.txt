Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal pretending to be a spiritual being, but pounding heads and killing as if it were nothing. He, of course, justifies, in the end, donating money to an orphanage. How sweet. Put the world to waste and we will ignore it if you take care of a girl. Jeesh! This time, he is partner of Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). There has to be someone to put all those lines of induction, man, and there are many. Dialogue sucks. <br /> <br /> They go after the bandits Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people who were born to play fools. <br /> <br /> He's squeezing Mari Morrow and impressing the soap. star Sarah Buxton. How cute! <br /> <br /> I think if you have to have some emotion in the July Force, that might be enough. If nothing else, it will help you to get your degree in Seagalology.
