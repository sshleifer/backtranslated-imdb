Wow, even American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance have more adult stuff now than WWE (at least auditions have multiple people abusing judges) and here's WWE in one of the worst moves in TV history, changing in PG. Now, when I change a few times to see what's happening, this is what I get: 1) Hornswoggle, the ugly dwarf splitting his space with the main eventers seemingly without reason, except for thrilling the <br /> <br /> 2) A guest host (arghh ....!) every week to spoil the teaspoon of fun that was present in another way. All of these presenters are cheap B-type celebrities trying to get back to fame, making terrible 5-year jokes and making foolish references. <br /> <br /> 3) Cryme Time and a fighter (I forgot her name, most likely Eva) giving lessons on several words "street" (sob) that are neither street nor freshness. They were fun before, stealing things and being loud mouths. <br /> <br /> 4) Divas are wearing unattainable clothes, tying their best to look "sexy, smart and powerful" (by the way, I hate that slogan) Remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there? Those were the times In addition, these divas are bad wrestlers, which adds to the misery I saw some old WWE games in the Vintage collection and the divas there were "professional" no 5) The PG movement restricts many things: almost none blood during the matches, DX being terribly annoying, John Cena making even more of his act of patriotism, crowd containing many kids (who are so annoying), almost no "jumps", etc. 6) And yes, why keep PPVs so often. One in each month, have they lost? No real rivalry is created and the ones that are made seem fake and just-till-the-PPV-over-overs. <br /> <br /> 7) Michael Cole and some of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and Gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest running television show in history" (every week " <br /> <br /> "The BRUTAL and VICIOUS Attack by (he does not use it for anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy" <br /> <br /> "A vicious attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple- HW !!! "<br /> <br /> WWE is now almost on the way to his death. Hope Vince gets up from his sleep and does something (bring back TV-14 or the attitude era ) 2 out of 10 for the current state of WWE.
