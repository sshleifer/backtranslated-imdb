I'll be generous here and give it a 3 just because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how the city was filmed. That said, this movie was really bad. It's as if they had started almost without a script and the director just told the actors to face each other significantly with a lot of music playing on him. And Billy D. Williams looked like he'd rather be anywhere, except in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I could write a better script than the eviction for this movie, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I've seen mentioned in all the reviews and message boards - everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around World War II and actually looked more than it should beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Although the military was not segregated by then, I'm sure any troop waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like Huntsville, Al. film was supposed to be the 1940s, so Billy D, Lesley Ann and Rae Dawn would have to have been in the 70s and 80s instead of their 50s or 60s. <br /> Do not waste your time unless you really like the actors because the story is not very interesting.
