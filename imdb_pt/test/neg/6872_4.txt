Jealous Husband holds car dealership hostage while Williams overcharges the viewer with his worn out Mork shtick at every turn. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Pay the channel ammunition. An unusually bad script, along with an unconvincing Robin Williams, as a talkative and insightful Queens car salesman caught up in a hostage crisis in the workplace. The laughter is not there, the message (s) or morals are completely wrong, and the film can not decide whether it's a comedy or a drama. Very good cast all acting very badly. When a movie ages so fast, you smell bad. There is not much to be said other than maybe, avoid at all costs. Mediocre textbook movies like this are actually more boring and less enjoyable than the top bombs.
