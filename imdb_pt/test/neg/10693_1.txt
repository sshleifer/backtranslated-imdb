Odd Chuck Norris decided to put a last nail into the coffin <br /> <br /> Containing his film career before going to the safe world of CBS <br /> <br /> Attack on Saturday night with this hysterically supernatural bad < Actioner. <br /> <br /> For such a stupid movie, this thing is infallible. Norris is Chicago <br /> <br /> Officer Frank Shatter. First, what kind of surname is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met any Shatters? Genforum.com has no listing for the last name Shatter, which opens any clever viewer to replace the "a" in Shatter with an "i". He and his partner, Calvin Jackson, do the same old cop routine you've seen before: make fun of the pimps and drive the captain crazy. <br /> <br /> Jackson, looking like the theoretical love son of Whoopi Goldberg and Rick James, quickly uses the nerves with his constant complaint and Eddie Murphy. patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin engage with an emissary of Satan, to whom we are introduced in the long opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon that is locked in a crypt by King Richard , <br /> <br /> Lionhearted. The scepter of the devil, from which he derives his power, is caught in nine pieces and hides in nine different parts of the world by holy men. In 1951, some grave robbers accidentally let Prosatano leave and he began to collect the nine pieces. He disguises himself as an antiquity professor named Lockley and always gives a lecture where a holy man is killed and a piece of the scepter is taken away. <br /> <br /> Norris brings his "Walker: Texas Blunder" cohort Sheree Wilson, who plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with his investigation, they do glances at each other, and our intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi is killed in Chicago. While in Israel, Calvin is given even more to complain about: the heat, the lack of restaurant accommodations, the lousy drivers, and the fact that he is missing out on the Chicago Bulls' Playoffs <br /> <br /> games. Norris can even work with a cute Israeli boy in this nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and stands around the men, taking them around Israel and not arousing any kind of appropriate suspicion. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Lockley (Prosatano) gathers all the parts of the scepter, but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony and summon the devil. Where to find real blood? Well, Sheree's father is a duke! It has an American accent, but it is the writers' convenient method to force this monstrosity toward its inevitable conclusion. Of course, this servant of Satan may have killed countless hundreds over the years, but how will he behave against a good old kick in the American ass? <br /> <br /> After Prosatano was defeated, killed by his own scepter (I envied him, he did not have to see Bezi steal Calvin's wallet.) <Br> /> <br /> again), we are treated to a horrible coda involving a bearded man who has watched Shutter, I mean Shatter, and Calvin in his quest. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two warriors of the West would defeat Prosatano. The silent bearded man who watched the couple was none other than Jesus ... I'm not joking. He is listed as "Prophet" in the final credits, but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference that the filmmakers are trying to expose here. As in "I Wear a Walker: Texas Ranger," Norris is getting older and can no longer get into his fight scenes. He kicks a lot, and people fly over the furniture in slow motion, and then Norris gives all his line readings in that monotonous voice. Oh, that director of truth may be able to shape it! His brother, Aaron, who directed him in other films as well, has no sense of history or timing. Scenes are played for the good of the ego, not to entertain. The scenes in which the dynamic duo finds Bezi dragging himself non-stop, and then Bezi is not so important to the rest of the film. <br /> <The film was filmed in Israel, which means the Americans could personally insult the Israelis. There is no nice Israeli character here. The Israeli police captain is an idiot. <br /> <br /> The police driver does not know English, and Calvin convinces him that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing funnier than ridiculing those stupid strangers in their homeland, especially when all this racist humor comes from an American minority. They were more than offended if the tables were turned over <br /> <br /> and the Israeli policeman was mocking the African-American cop in Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written, misrepresented and misdirected. It does not work like action, police drama or even horror. This only shows that the now-defunct Cannon Studios was willing to throw their money at anything, no matter how much they planned. "Hellbound" is certainly a more appropriate title. I did not like this movie intensely. <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for physical violence, armed violence, swear words <br /> <br />, some sexual references and some adult situations. <Br/> <br />
