Even allowing for my blatant love of the first two films in the franchise, and sweeping away any kind of biased inclination I might have for Max's character, I just can not seem to risk evaluating on average that waste of cartoons space that So , almost dirty what had happened before. <br /> <br /> It was the rough and unpleasant streak that brought the sensation to the character Mad Max Rockatansky, who was the shocking feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world and, more crucially, disappeared. is the passion of director George Miller for the franchise. The terrible score coincides with the cartoon heart of the movie, it seems the manufacturers did not really know what to do with the amount of money given to make this third {and, fortunately last} installment. Of course the acrobatics are in place (as expected), and of course Miller can paint a desert landscape of the desert, taking what he had done before. However, he clearly fought for new ideas with the action, since the coronation of Petrar Tanker is repeated here, except that he uses a train. <br /> <br /> It's just a very bad show that could seem like an ambitious turn of events in the mid-1980s; but on seeing the three films together now, Thunderdome ends up appearing as a director losing his nervous approach while sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is, none of these gender biases would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. I give the 3/10 movie purely for a real and good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunts here deserve some credit at the very least. But this is the third time I've tried to like this movie, and as a glutton for punishment like me, no doubt I am, I will not be trying again, ever.
