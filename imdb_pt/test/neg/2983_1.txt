This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen, but once I started it was like the really bad car accident on the side of the road - you can not help yourself, you just have to look. My eyes !!! The acting was horrible, the production was horrible, the footage was horrible, horrible, horrible, awful. I was glad that the priest was stung, he would have loved to have done it because of his poor performance. I mean sucking acting to the tenth power. I would have applauded if Chris had just eliminated their lot before turning it on. And what was with that damn hell wig on your head?! I sincerely hope no one has been paid, I mean, if they get paid they should be considered here, they should be paid never to try another film project, everyone who has been involved, never, never again. That was just a huge piece of crap that I'm ashamed to say I just had to keep watching until the end. Do not watch, it is about an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back, and then you will have to spend time registering on this site so you can write a comment like what I am doing now, which you should do as a catharsis to survive the tremors of having seen this movie (and I use the term "movie" loosely here).
