First, few colleges allow students to take courses with their parents' lovers. Second, few teachers sleep with dorm cooks. Third, few coeds have a parent cooking in their dormitory. Fourth, once a SECOND member of a small group's project team faces a violent death, the college PRESIDENT will dissolve the entire class, and DO NOT close your eyes when the teacher happily drives the rest of the group to death terrible. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to really appreciate how much this movie really sucks!
