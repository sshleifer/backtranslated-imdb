Wow, that was a real stink. This initial sci-fi movie has nothing to do with it. There's a lot of scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialogue, it's laughable. The female character played by Osa Massen is just a device for male characters to serve sexist remarks throughout the duration of the film. Watch this with your girlfriend, I guarantee she'll make your blood boil. The only good thing is the musical score that cleverly builds the moods of the movie. The special effects are pretty rough, but they are not bad considering the movie crop. With some good B-stars in the lead roles, acting is not all that bad. But the lines given them must have given them a great challenge. The challenge of not laughing their heads.
