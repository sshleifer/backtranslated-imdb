These rubber monsters have failed to be cool, scary or even comedians, it looks like a Porkys movie or Animals House, but the sequences and story are not always clear either can not get their attention the whole movie looks cheap and with an incredible bad taste , the only thing that makes you laugh are the terrible rubber monsters that should have a cost of a dollar each because the work or they never seem realistic, the moves and expressions make the Muppets look like a Pixar 3D movie when you compare with this. Hope Marie Carlton is the only thing that makes this horrible movie bearable, and when she dies in the movie, it becomes even worse than before. A movie that should only be seen in rapid advance.
