I love movies, all genres and from big dollar shows to small independent projects. But even considering that this piece of junk is 25 years old and its attempt to honor the 1950s, it suffers only in almost every respect, by which we judge films. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I have been reminded of several "student films", had the chance to watch, efforts where creativity is needed to fill gaps where funds are needed. <br /> <br /> In short, chances are that there are much better uses for 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 2/10
