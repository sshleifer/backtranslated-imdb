There was a time when Michael Jackson was revered as the King of Pop. Then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps. Finally, now is the time when we feel sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is another reason for this. I promised a fanatical Michael Jackson fan to watch with her. You know the type of fan - someone who tells himself to like everything the object of affection has ever done. While watching this movie, which she had seen twice, I realized how far this fandom goes. Probably far enough to rate this movie above 1/10 as some people did miraculously. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to be a parody of many other films and series, most notably Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. . Unfortunately, it fails miserably at any level. The acting does not save the story absolutely horrible, the footage has the quality of a video tape very often played, the special effects were best performed in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not now: with foil) .. All this It would be funny if the movie could be, well, funny. Unfortunately it is not. It hurts to watch this. <br /> <br /> And then there's the appearance of Michael Jacksons in this trash. He appears on a projection screen to convey an important message, and manages to be as mobile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4-year-old. Just when I thought "who is the terrible person who attracted this poor man to participate in this film and once again make a complete idiot of himself," I (finally) got to the final credits and found that the film was actually partially filmed in Jackson. Ranch Neverland. In other words: it. Likes It. <br /> <br /> This film, and the involvement of Jackson, is truly disturbing. Do not even watch it for "haha, a movie on the under 100 IMDb". Or be warned.
