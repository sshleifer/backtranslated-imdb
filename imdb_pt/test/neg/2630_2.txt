This is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in many years. I started to see the movie not expecting much and that's exactly what it delivered ... not much! In fact, it ended up delivering even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the opening parts of the movie was that I would probably end up rating it as "4". I thought it looked like it had a good photo and an amazing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As the movie progressed, however, the rating continued to fall down and in my head mostly due to the pedestrian acting and a plot that was of being just silly and insipid at first to be silly and disgusting near of the end. By the time the movie ended, I was willing to rate it no more than a "1". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money on this.
