This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Enlightened One with a castle (or a very cheap ensemble masked as a castle, to be specific) replacing it as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same as you see in a Cinemax porn movie, as well as the photography, the scenery, the lighting and the video it was filmed in. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there is no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic to your characters than to show them an emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty commonplace. Want an example? A blind girl listening to a tape of language teaching the Italian words to the colors begins to cry with what she will never see. <br /> <br /> This movie had some things to it, though: the monster is actually pretty cool. very scary. And there is a decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of "erotic" Italian films. The blood, however, leaves much to be desired, as does the performance, even of the experienced Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> In addition, I only saw two other Stuart Gordon films: Re-Animator and From Plus, both were excellent. But I will not let that little footnote in your career prevent me from watching his many other films.
