There was no need for this film, clear and simple. The original, though hated by some, was something I found really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey actually started to lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, "Smoooooookin!" Nuff said. So why do a sequel / prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey would not do it, it should have been a clue enough not to deserve it. But then they make mistakes after the mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe? The writing and the story: terrible. Why would I want to see a baby wearing the mask? Besides, why would I want to fly? Ever? HOW DID SOMEBODY THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?! The acting is despicable, in fact almost everything about this movie is. I'm trying to keep cool or the IMDb probably will not let me post this. Bottom line: do not watch this piece of garbage. Take the original, see how good Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey used to have a career, and laugh. Do not waste a second of your time on this.
