There is an endless supply of worthless horror movies. It seems like people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill. Unfortunately, these attempts are successful. This unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. The story is highly predictable, most actors are very uninspired, or simply miscast, very low quality special effects. It took a lot of effort not to turn off the DVD and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films issued in the US, why in the world would anyone want to import such nonsense? To complete, apparently there is an "Anatomy 2", for those who have nothing better to do. I'd rather see the paint dry.
