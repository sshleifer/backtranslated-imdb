It is unfortunate, but also happy, that two films about holes - The Cave and the Descent - arrive at the same time. Unfortunately for The Descent its UK release on July 7 coincided with the same day of the terrorist atrocity that killed almost 60 people and injured hundreds - not a particularly good night / weekend to appear in the movies, especially to see a scary movie about lovely women being trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic subterranean cave system. The two films have practically the same elements - about half a dozen characters, lost in a previously unexplored caves system, with no one out there aware that they are trapped down there. Lots of water, caves, dangers ... then, ultimately, some cruel creatures, similar to humans or derived from humans, determined to attack them. Where the two are so different is that The Cave is unreal, entirely unbelievable, more alien science fiction adventure than horror, or drama. The comparatively minuscule British film (filmed in southern England, though mounted in the Appalachians) is five terrifying pairs of trousers, a breathtaking shock, causing the stomach to revolve and people leaving the exhibits at the start of the crash. He knocks the girls down in any old order - you genuinely have no idea what to expect next - it certainly is not her! The Descent is also illuminated in a naturalistic way, making it even more frightening, unlike the richly lit cave that resembles a gigantic Christmas Santa claus magical grotto with a room the size of a dazzling cathedral in a gloriously blue light of ... who knows where, while torches caves are employed exclusively to artistically illuminate granite chin heroes (each more like a puppet than any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation). Fantastic quantities of equipment are also loaded, but despite that, impossibly deep actors have forgotten to guard any imminent sense of danger, drama or anything worthy of a horror movie - it is strictly classified as PG. And in this case the actors fit exactly in the order that everyone expects - I quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character, just leaving Piper Perabo out of order. The cave script is entirely by numbers, unlike Shakespeare, a room full of chimpanzees would end up writing it in less than a week ... Make a typical exchange between the white and black bonds of the "good friend"; "How many times have we been in this situation before the button?" - "many" (Morris Chesnut answers). I swear, you could hear my London suburban crowd sighing with the truism. The scariest thing about the cave is that at the end there is a clear opening for 'the sequence' - 'The Cave 2: Overground' or whatever. Be afraid, be very afraid ... Or, instead, take The Descent and feel really afraid, very, very, very afraid. RR
