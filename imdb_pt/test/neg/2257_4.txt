A very un-Tom and Jerry short. Jerry tells this tale that revolves around Tom the cat falling in love and losing it to his rival, Butch. Tom is Jerry's best friend here, which irritated me a bit. The cartoon is also featured in Cinemascope. Overall I found this drawing of Tom and Jerry sad and depressing. The should have just put "Puss gets the boot" on the DVD instead and I would have been happy. This experimental animated short can be found on Disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set. It's the last on the set and I hope Warner Brothers will choose to release a second volume soon. <br /> <br /> My notes: C-
