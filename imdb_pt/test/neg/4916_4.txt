It is not good. -Not even. <br /> <br /> This part revolves around a descent of the original killer inside the house of Amityville who must face her past to get rid of the nightmare terror of Amityville herself. <br /> <br /> It's basically nothing. My bet is that this movie was made for a quick extra money to buy a boat or something ... because this is just ridiculous ... Fortunately, it does not kill or spoil the series, but it simply has no effect on it. I would have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old and infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this a bit more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".
