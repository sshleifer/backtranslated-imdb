When I knew they were doing this, I was happy considering that the first movie was very good, albeit a bit short. <br /> <br /> But then I remembered some of the disasters of the Disney sequel that I watched earlier (I'm looking at you Little Mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway I watched and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best thing is that the animation is great. It really has that special polish that Disney's "proper" movies have. <br /> <br /> Besides ... the rest is disappointing. The plot is serious all over the place. One moment is about something, then it changes completely to another storyline and then switches to another completely different storyline. It reminded me of how the movie Family Guy was like three separate episodes turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed maybe once at most. Kronk was very funny in the original movie, but in that he's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, unless someone lends you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
