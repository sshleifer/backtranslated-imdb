After reading this story for some time, I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. It's one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. What I think makes history is the relationship. That was the worst point for me in the movie because I think the relationships were poorly expressed in the film. I have no idea what the point is of changing the roles of the main characters (the characters of Tim and Alan). The film did not capture John and Savannah's relationship. Maybe, if you did not read the book, you might like this movie, but I thought it was so annoying compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great choice for John, but I had the feeling that he was going to bring all the young people to watch, so I guess it was more aimed at them. The ending cuts through the whole point of the book, so I was also dissatisfied with it. I was hoping the movie was more like a notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. I feel like I wasted a Friday night and 10 bucks in a sentimental love story, not in the whole story I was hoping to see.
