"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes of "Fellini Satyricon" of 1970, with bizarre visions, aberrations and representations of sexual excesses, all set in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini is not ... First of all, it's not so much fun. A lot of screen time is dedicated to McDowell's bulging eyes and rubber face in the paper holder. Their performance is too embarrassed and overdone to be convincing. Jay Robinson's interpretations of "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, the latter being the most varied. Relief could have been judiciously provided by the development of the characters around more completely. So, they are little more than figures. An example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari, who has a huge screen presence in an important role, but is left mostly in the background. The only positive features to be credited are the skilful use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the soundtrack and the inclusion of some of the despicable but precise actions of the despot. These two factors are much smaller than what is needed to alleviate the prevailing boredom.
