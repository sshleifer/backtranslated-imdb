"The Best Movie of the 90s" "The Welsh Trainspotting" .... Aye, right! I got into this movie with very high expectations, and it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> This film should be this archetypal film about the drug culture of the early 1990s, and would allow us all to see inside this scene and break the media's prejudices by following the moral panic that followed death by Leah Betts in 1995. Unfortunately, it fell far short. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult on the subject, and potential problems involving drugs, this has provided us with a story about the wonder of drugs, and how it may please you you know, how to open your mind totally. Cue some guff over Bill Hicks and Howard Marks to nausea. It's painfully bad at times. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt really made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip guides us through this tale is how to hear THAT A waking face you met at a home party, who talks to you about how "the man "is holding us back, and how Acid has freed him from the tensions of modern society. You just want to shake some sense into him, and ask him to leave the place. <br /> <br /> The script was a real problem for me, because where Trainspotting had Irvine Welsh's excellent book to quote, this is written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of all trades, master of no one" come to mind. You can see where your inspiration comes from, particularly in the narrative style of the main character Jip (who defines the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera, and describes what is going through his mind as the scenario unfolds )) The problem with this is that some of the speeches for the camera are just painful to watch. Mostly this comes down to a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to look philosophical that they end up sounding like their middle-level drama project. The direction is good, and the intentions are good, but it is so lacking in integrity that you begin to wonder what the hype is all about. <br /> <br /> Saying that, though, is not all bad. There are moments that are genuinely very fun and fun. Moff is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent film, he also managed to attract a large number of quality British actors / actresses, which may show why there was so much excitement in the film. <br /> <br /> Best movie of the 90s? Not for a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid Sunday night movie then this might just be your bag. Inevitably, the movie is flawed by the hype surrounding it.
