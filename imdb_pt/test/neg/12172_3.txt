Terrible. I hope I can save two hours of your life by telling you away from it. I just watched the movie, BTW. <br /> <br /> I love good cross-genre films. This is not one of them. Show me a science fiction musical, a dramatic farce or a religious action movie, I'll watch them all. But you can not just play epigram jokes at a festival of horror, encampment and terror, and call my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical movies. This is not one of them. Anyone who is surprised by the depths of the intellect cloaked in this movie has not read a good book recently. Or always. The "thought-provoking" dialogue is banal, at best. Maybe I missed something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I love a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Laugh! I thought I would never start! Squirm? Only when I'm trying to think of a polite way of expressing my movie feedback to the friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is incongruously good on the scene of this movie, but even he can not resurrect it. I just wish he had shot the director instead of zombies. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, the land that gave birth to Hell should also give rise to this. Dante would be spinning in his grave.
