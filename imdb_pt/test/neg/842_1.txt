Having read the novel for the first time, I do not care, for the purposes of filming, of how it is differentiated, as long as it adheres or at least includes the plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story is added. The reason this novel passed the test of time is undoubtedly due to the interweaving of both the characters and the plot as a whole. Interfering with this structure is destroying the intricate balance of the plot and thus the storyteller's intent. Although it's a matter of opinion, the release of this movie leaves much to be desired. Characters, described as too fat, should at least be made to look stout, to allow the character to have credibility. The days of slavery could not have ended, or certainly actors of that caliber would have been in revolt, with so much farce in history. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as being manly in appearance, ... The very feminine appearance of Tara Fitzgerald does not seem true. Again, Laura Fairly is described as "fair," if not as "ethereal", so with dark hair, it does not fit perfectly into the impression obtained in the novel. .... Badly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J.
