Looking at the ratings, you would say this is a classic, but again it's just another example of independent filmmakers trying to spark interest in your movie. Are not they even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? I think to compensate for the curve and make up every 1/10 will be. Is that better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Acting, tacky and trash. <br /> <br /> The sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it were not for where the actors looked, you would not know where it came from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people act as if they borrowed the father's camera soon after seeing the matrix. Less is more but more of this team is absolutely pap. <br /> <br /> Zombies are rubbish too. I do not doubt that most of these people will never be heard again, and it will be for good reason. I hope the zombies eat your eyes, since it was 90 minutes of paparazzi that I will not go back. <br /> <br /> And the counterfeit rating only makes it a million times worse. <br /> <br /> A critic said it was one of the best horror movies he's seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was a success at the time. Watch the trailer as if it were a warning about how bad this movie is.
