When this series aired, I watched most of it. I think it should be a long series in the vein of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk" where the protagonist is being pursued by the country in search of a solution to their problems. In this case, the problem of the hero is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good, especially the painful relationship between the main character and his wife. The problem is: they canceled before they had a chance to finish. (or this or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They also did not get a chance to finish the story, knowing that it had been canceled. Poof just disappeared. However, as I said before, I might have missed the last few episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. From where I stopped in the series. The wife of the main character dies in a fire started by a chase involving King's famous organization, the Lodge. While fleeing hero is kidnapped. He ends up with his friends realizing that they have to save him from the Lodge. The end. Last episode In the video: Your wife does not die, but escapes the fire with him. Sure when he should be caught by the Lodge, he and his wife share a strange moment and then cease to exist. Abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put that video out and decided to score in an ending regardless of how bad it was. They may also have shown some images of the first detonations of the atomic bomb. Almost Pythonesco. <br /> <br /> The show had a legal opening sequence in the David Bowie song of the same name.
