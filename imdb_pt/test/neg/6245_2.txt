In my continuing quest to find the worst movie ever, my friends and I stumbled upon this little gem. It's hilarious, especially if you do not know (as we do not know) that's a semi-sequel to another horror series. <br /> <br /> I will not bother getting into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrendous snowstorm that was coming (it was tantamount to characters shouting "FORESHADOWING!" on the camera and swinging their arms), and in some strange twist of fate the snowstorm has already occurred. Budgetary problems, I guess. <br /> <br /> Add this to a magic door that is open or closed, depending on the effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with plenty of soap. I'll admit it; I had difficulty breathing at some points. The only decent part of this movie, as it turned out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre film. It's so much funnier now that I know that. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end where it is revealed that the slasher did this because his drunken friends stumbled upon her and a friend kissing and then A friend driving on a train or something is probably the funniest source of a murdered psychopath, intensified by the fabulous use of blurry images and images. I'm glad all of the slasher's friends have completely forgotten about the incident until a flashback was needed. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, to take this and see the hilarity. Of course, the continuity editor should get a prize for all this, if they were not stuck in that horrible snowstorm ...
