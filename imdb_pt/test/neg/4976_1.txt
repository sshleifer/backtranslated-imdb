Unforgivable is Clint Eastwoods last homage to the once great west. But while I thought this was going to be good and raise the level for future westerns to come I was sadly mistaken. Unforgivable, though simple in the plot, it falls flat on characters and emotions and I would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwood's worst movie to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the role of driving and driving, which also adds a slump to the overall look of the movie. <br /> <br /> All characters look hasty and ragged at the edges, especially in Eastwood's character. The acting does not seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. The direction is badly deceived by peculiar shots. So, in general, the Unforgivable is not the best of Eastwood and by far one of the Worst Westerners in the world.
