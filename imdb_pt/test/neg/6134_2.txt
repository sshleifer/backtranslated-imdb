I saw the DVD in a store near my house, and since I am addicted to horror movies and aliens, I imagined how good it was. He even had two award mentions on the cover (I can not remember the festival he won) so I thought "Hey, this could be good." So I bought it (for five euros) and came here for the IMDb to check out some comments. Here people either hit the movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie films blah, blah. I then played the DVD, not thinking of any revisions I'd read, with an open mind, and not expecting anything. <br /> <br /> Dude ... I do not like being so critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I'll give you some tips on what I thought: 1-Acting / dialogue: The acting was so confused ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes where I could not see any effort of them! The dialogue was even worse ... I think it was probably the aspect that I did not like most throughout the movie. The conversation between the characters seemed ... out. Not just bad but far from the actual events of the movie. The monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became annoying and irritating in a short time ... But of course the most ridiculous aspect was the ... "aliens" or the "infected" ... I will not even comment he will just say that he was absolutely ridiculous and took all the humor out of the picture; 2-Visuals: The strongest aspect of the movie ... if you forget the terrible effects of light and flash they used to simulate explosions or what the heck they should be. The "camera in the car" look was pretty cool, but they did not even use the environment to inspire fear or dread. They left it for cheap sound and video effects and for the three "infected" characters. The movie becomes boring in so many scenes ...; 3-sound: talk about editing ... this movie has no problem in showing how weakly edited it was. From computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So what I liked about the movie ... (SPOILERS) the only thing I really liked and In fact, it was quite scary the succession of two scenes in which the car is stopped and you notice something / someone walking in a distant. At first I really thought it was me seeing things, but when the character realizes that the "figures" coming toward him were his own reflection, I was surprised! Very scary idea done well! Besides ... I had a horrible time. <br /> <br /> And I do not recommend this to anyone ... not even "teenager meets" because you can not even laugh about it .... <br /> <br /> I give a solid 2. Only a few technical achievements worked here ... besides ... yes ... nothing
