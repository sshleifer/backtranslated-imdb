I would like to know who deceived the producers of this film to pay for their production - That persion is a kind of genius. This movie somehow caught my attention for about two-thirds of it until I realized that it was going nowhere fast. I think the song made it seem like something was happening, but nothing really was. It was not scary. The dialogue was misspelled. The first 90 minutes should have been done in about 15 minutes. This would have been a moderately acceptable episode of the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> At this point, I'm just crazy to have lost all this time. It's a few hours I'll never come back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments prevent someone from spending the night. Take a nap or go to the gym instead. Or, if you want to be afraid, turn on a cable news channel.
