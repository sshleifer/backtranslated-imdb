It's sad what they're leaving at the film festivals these days. I had to go through more than twenty minutes of this short and melancholic that was not at all funny to get a good place for a movie that I wanted to see at a local film festival. The festival planners put together this horrible short with a great feature. I am very happy that the appeal was good, otherwise I would not have been a very happy camper! <br /> <br /> For a comedy short film there is no laughing. The title says it all.
