The first 4 episodes of Season 6 are just to vomit, to the predictable and worst-case scenario I've ever seen. No and I hope I do not buy it. Also seen in the back seasons that the episodes about the space they made, they suck even more. All I want to say to people who do this is: do not make an entire episode about space because they are bad. The point is that Season 6 sucks even more than the previous seasons. It gets worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and frustrated watching the first 4 episodes of season 6 that I just had to write this. Only people who are brainwashed can watch this crap. It seems like the people who write the scenery are running out of ideas for a long time. I think my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people.
