Scarecrow Gone Wild begins when high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his teammates decide to take a 'trot' to imitate the diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. Mike and his companion decide to take Sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to an amazing scarecrow, and leave him there all night, it seems fun right? Well, things backfire when Sam goes into diabetic coma after suffering from a hypoglycaemia and Sam's vengeful spirit enters the scarecrow that comes to life and begins to hunt down the children responsible for the unfortunate situation threatening Sam's life. Sam's best friend, Jack (Matthew Linhardt) and his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling), can save Sam's day and life? Written and Directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third direct entry to the video in the Scarecrow series, and although I have not seen any of the previous two, after seeing the Scarecrow Gone Wild, I certainly I'm not in a hurry to change this situation for sure. The script really does have an almost decent premise as Sam's victimized soul seeks revenge and his friends have to keep the real Sam alive somehow, but the way it is told is bad and I suppose basically it's just irrelevant to the fact that this is a movie about a terrifying murderer running around killing people in ways not too bloody or imaginative. Having said that there are one or two scenes here that save her from a star rating, the joke on the cornfield is funny and something that many immature guys can do (like me), the part where two guys bury their partner in sand and then get on top of it and pee on it is also pretty funny on a youthful path and a little cold when a guy starts singing a horrible song to the scarecrow throws a pole that impales it! However, these OK bits are few and far between and, as a whole, it's a silly, boring and poorly written teenage horror movie with a highly annoying character that irritates. It's also very predictable and has a stupid twist that does not really present the scarecrow at all which is a problem like when you watch a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild you expect to see a scarecrow go crazy and I have to admit that it looks good cool as the horror character goes. Director Katkin does a reasonable job here, in fact, though what on earth is with that hospital at the end and all the neon illumination everywhere and the fact that there is only one patient there and two staff members? Cinematography is much better than the usual low-end horror film for low-budget video and there is a nice, yet totally unreal lighting. The movie has no real fear or tension and some of the medical terminology used is a little doubtful to say the least and I say this as an insulin dependent diabetic myself. There is not much boring here, there are some scenes where some actors have some fake guts in their stomachs to portray them being gutted, but it seems very fake, there is also a burnt face and a couple of impalements, but little else. There are a fair amount of naked female breasts on display, if that's what you like. <br/> <br/> Technically Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good, considering some of the low budget abominations I've recently gone through, unfortunately it's still a bad movie. In general. The less said about acting, the better. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the scumbags of straight-to-video horror that has come out recently, but having said it's not much better and it's still a bad movie when all is said and done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), which also went directly to the video.
