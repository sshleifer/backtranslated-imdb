I went into Heart Of Gold thinking that I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-sufficient tribute to the arrogance of baby boomers who lost their minds and forgot their roots. Highly rated by the aging baby boomers, directed and performed by older baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a festival from start to finish, that is, if you can watch the entire movie for almost 2 hours. Neil Young and the crew have long since lost their advantage and want the rest of us to join them in a mid-swing mediocrity rocker. What happened to the guitar daring of your first solo efforts? I think all their down boxes rusted and their vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of their generation. As far as Demme is concerned, this is the daring director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a bolder film than this poorly-seen surface performance film. Do not waste your $$ on Heart Of Gold and go straight to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to delve into the personality of a rock and roll icon, get a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock And Roll, which is extremely exhausted. And baby boomers, do not bother to complain about how this review is tired by someone younger. I'm also one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl in acid and danced in the streets for the Stones Street Fighting Man. Go back and watch Do not Look Back or Gimmie Shelter and then come back and tell me that Heart of Gold has some value as a document.
