We thought this was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to watch the finale. The novel was not credible; the characters were not developed; the love affair hardly made sense; was miscast; and landscape was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) how the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATION ... just creepy, gypsy and cheese; and the OUTERBANKS do not typically look like those houses in surfing; and who would spend the night in a hurricane if it were not for them. It was not realistic either. Hurricanes give you enough warning to close the hatches. The friend too was superfluous; and did not coincide with the story. What did the civil war have to do with the outside? I also have to mention the wardrobe ... D. Lane have to have a scarf / pashmina / shawl in every scene? It was an exaggeration. She looked good enough not to have to hide things; without making them obvious, as with light pants. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm worried about the impact on our landfills when everyone has to get rid of this stupid movie, and I say STUPID !!!! Do not fall for the hype on this one !!!!!! We did. Not even watchable.
