This movie is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by the strong and powerful performances of Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he also features a talented actress, newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but this is only the only positive element in a mess of another movie. While Lopez de Ayala struggles to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her handsome husband, it seems she has not been able to develop her character through this one-dimensional feature; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and politics of the time was essential in her history ... but here she is presented as a romantic protagonist of a novel; this is a real shame, and the film is a missed opportunity to show how personal life can influence history and vice versa. Worst of all, the Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri end up performing in terrible performances, which, in Liotti's case, is a real problem, since he plays Felipe el Hermoso, a central role in this story. It seems a clear choice to attract young audiences as they both seem top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors like Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely wasted in supporting clearly underdeveloped roles. Even if this was a big-budget movie, it did not bother to bring in a good screenplay or create "period pieces" on the screen. The costumes are particularly grotesque in some scenes of the group, as if they were taken from stock material, without considering a real coherence. In short, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and this is what makes the difference with much higher historical films like LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director's point of view. This is a strange turnaround in Aranda's career, as he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and LOVERS come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA is no more than a historical academic piece routine. and a not very good at it!
