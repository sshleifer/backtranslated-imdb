When Hollywood is trying to understand how she is an "intelligent person," they fail so miserably, finding it difficult to put words into the mouth of the supposed "genius." <br /> <br /> Sure, any genius goes around trying to rub in his superiority in every instance. Of course, they go out in bars and choose fights? it's not like they are (uncontrollably generalizing) autistic nerds who never have a tan. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if you are a genius you know all about Mathematics and History and Politics and of course you are constantly dating the current events and a thorough analysis of them. Because all these things go together and things like that, you know? <br /> <br /> Besides, you walk around with a smile all the time. You're just a presumptuous son of a know-what-that's how it is, all of you. <br /> <br /> And of course you smoke, like someone who has never smoked before, but you smoke because it's cool, you know. And you are different. That is understood. <br /> <br /> Of course you can fight? You're a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10,000 books whenever he does not lift weights. And whenever he does not smoke or drink beer, because he follows a strict health regime. <br /> <br /> And you go out with a college student in his early thirties? Minnie Driver. Well, I will not even comment on Matt Damon. Team Am√©rica has already hit the head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Beavis & Butthead student's dream (in other words, 95% of them): "Yes, that's how I would be if I were a genius." But stupid people and stupid writers in this case can not imagine the life of geniuses.
