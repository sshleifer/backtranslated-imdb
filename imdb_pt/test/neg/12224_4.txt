RKO was trying to raise her little star, JOAN FONTAINE, when she was cast as a flying nurse who has enough willpower to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) accept the drain of responsibilities on this little programmer. The TCM conveyed it as a stepping stone to Joan Fontaine's career. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is serious and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is well as his love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the arrogant looks and looks of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared the best billing with Fontaine. What happened to this handsome actor? Why did not RKO promote it with Fontaine? He showed ability as a lightweight comedian. These are the kinds of thoughts that went through my head as I watched this rather lukewarm drama that never gets to the hard promise of its title. The story itself is quite tiresome, only occasionally gaining life because of Fontaine's spirited heroine. <br /> <br /> She photographs beautifully as the nurse and uses her serious expressions skillfully, suggesting that there was more to be enjoyed in the future. meeting. Beal has never been to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. Strictly lackluster. <br /> <br /> But what happened to Philip Huston? The evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career. Trivia Note: Pay attention to Dwight Frye (of "Dracula") as the out-of-control patient on board the plane.
