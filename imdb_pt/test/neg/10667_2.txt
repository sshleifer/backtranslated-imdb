Who filled up this stupid idea of ​​acting and producing a movie in Hime's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of the face all the time? I just hope it's the first and the last too, for God's sake! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything, to create an aura of his singing talent, which is nothing more than atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love . songs. Why does not Himes smile? Simple, because it does not use toothpaste close Up! Now this friend of yours, who haunts you everywhere, and this number one lawyer in town, who has to sexually molest herself and try to seduce Himesh, of all the pretty Germans she might have known before, maybe the male lawyers . In this part of the world you can be cursing your destiny, destined to deal with the hard and unattractive hill every day! The action scenes are just as fun, as the thief-attacked event planner, cars walking on cars, and so on. The bride's father seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her, that he flies here and there. Very hypocritical, he praises HR for distributing love among the people of the world, as if they were sweet, and behind him, coldly gives a talk to his daughter about these show business men. when Himesh is proven innocent, he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy, as if it were a musical chair game! I could not see the face of the poor guy, right? Hansika in the role of Ria, looks like she's in need of an eye-exam up, for tension in her eyes! The guy in the role of friend is good, has acted naturally and should be in better films, such as Sharman Joshi, for example. The childish artist in Trishu's brief appearance is sweet but wasted. It seems like the young generation of today has gone mad, since they prefer this kind of mocking of letters and scores, and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost will come. This is a strange taste in music and quite funny. I am surprised, as such classical lyricists as Gulzar, have opted for Himesh of all people, to give music. There is a story in Panchtantra, that a crow attaches so many feathers of a peacock, to look beautiful, and appeal to the birds; but the feathers fall at the end, and the true dark raven is revealed! Hope Himesh gives a hint, and refrains from fabricating such meaningless things, and wasting precious money, which he earned by charging so much his short nose! Your friend tells him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the DVD! and correct these misspellings, will you? an extra and in the movie, and not in love! There is also a famous number from the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, in which Mallika Sherawat moves once more, but this time with Himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, Ria, her so-called true love, and her new bride is not this way! Now that was very clever, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie that you did cleverly, to justify the presence of Sherawat. But does not she look a little washed?
