A terrible farce of Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz evil miscast as a Greek cephalone girl (there are plenty of good English attractive? Speaking Greek actresses so why choose a Spanish lady for one of the main roles and with an English actor as his father, supposedly a Greek physician !? the cast of support are well known actors and actresses of the Greek theater and TV series. The only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic point guard in the Greek mogul, and as a Greek colonel in the arms of Navarone. <br /> <br /> There is some historical truth reflected in the film. <br /> <br /> People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not hard , unlike the Germans who succeeded them, and Mussolini's forces, as suggested in the film, were defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign, after the Germans intervened in the Bal and allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece, the refusal of the local government to surrender to the Italian forces, not the Germans. as pictured in the film is quite plausible, although I'm not sure that this actually happened.
