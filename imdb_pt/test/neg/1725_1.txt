Peter Crawford discovers a comet en route from collision with the moon. But when the government does not believe in it (dumb fact # 1). He builds a shelter underground and is drawing lots to see who will. In addition, he is willing to kill to save mankind (mute fact # 2). With millions of dollars in technology, how could a civilian see what NASA could not? Moreover, the ends justify the moral means of this story is simply wrong! This movie is unlikely and totally unbelievable. What was going on in these minds of people, why the hell did piles of crap like that get green light? Sometimes I wonder who has to fuck to make a movie in this incredible city.
