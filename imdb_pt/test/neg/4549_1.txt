This has to be one of the WORST movies I've seen. I tried to like this movie, but they managed to ruin virtually every single aspect of this movie! Dialogues cheap, no character development, no tension, no story enough to lure him, no action beyond some REALLY cheap scenes. It looks like they tried a few things on the set and they said to each other, "Hey, this looks really cool, why not put that in there," after which the director probably said "Yeah .... YEAH this is great!" and smelled coke again or something. When it comes to acting, I think the only person who tried to make the film work is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it's all for nothing. Because this movie SUCKS !! 2/10
