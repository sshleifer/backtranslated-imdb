The Mystery Science Theater 3000 would not have been able to bring any redeeming quality to a display of this "gem". <br /> <br /> This is like an 80's porn pirate copy that you could have bought at a VHS from a 42nd. before Disney bought everything and closed them. <br /> <br /> But, wait - all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse movie. This film could replace water boarding as a human method of interrogation. <br /> <br /> No, I accept that - I prefer water-boarding. <br /> <br /> The only credit that this movie could win besides being the worst film ever made would threaten the Middle East to solve its problems under penalty of having to watch this movie.
