I do not expect much from ghost stories, but I hope a story makes a little sense! Is that too much to ask of writers and filmmakers? When the villain suddenly becomes a homicidal maniac just because a bunch of ravens starts pecking him, then I have a problem in spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. Has anyone learned anything in their 101 Cinema class? A good movie has an interesting story at its root! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages from this movie: If you have desperate financial problems, move from Chicago to the middle of nowhere in North Dakota to Grow Sunflowers (I'm not joking!). If your baby has serious neurological problems resulting from a car accident, move away from some of the best hospitals and speech-language pathologists in the country to a small isolated town, which at best has a community hospital. Hire a tramp to live and work with you, out of nowhere, without checking any reference, when you have a teenage daughter, a wife and a child. (I'm glad they're not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows that everything would have no problem in losing a triple homicide, just out of town. And, of course, blame the madness of man for a bad harvest of sunflowers! (Nothing else grows in North Dakota?) A couple of days after buying his decaying home - with huge creepers growing everywhere - you remember Jack and the Beanstalk, a guy from the X-Files, Smoking Man happy to see that the cigarette did not get him, I think he does not inspire!) It will suddenly surprise you while you are working to offer him the sale price of your house, plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you get it. I've seen so many horrible movies forgotten by God last month, it just drives me crazy! Is it so difficult to make a movie that does not treat audiences like an idiot? I'm happy, at least the crows in this sad movie turned out to have a few brains! I wish I could say the same to anyone who thinks they're going to make money on this celluloid rubbish!
