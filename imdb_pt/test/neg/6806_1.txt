In order to enjoy 'Fur - An imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus,' Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is the very use of the name and knowledge of Diane Arbus for her life and work, which causes this film to fail on a grand scale. <br /> <br /> What becomes apparent very early with the release of the film. The beautiful and fascinating Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamorous Jewess Diane Arbus, is that Shainberg did not get Arbus or what his work was about (non-sentimental realism) and seems attracted only by Arbus on a superficial level through his photographs of freaks of circus. <br /> <br /> What follows is a kind of beautiful, trivial biography of Beauty and the Beast, with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's fictional love interest. However, it is not the banality of history that is the main flaw in this film, but the director's misogynist stance that Diane Arbus, one of the most unique and original photographers in the art world, was unable to form her own ideas about her work . While her previous film 'Secretary' was a study of female masochism, her continued portrayal of the woman as submissive spoils this film altogether - and shuns Diane Arbus' real-life courage, tenacity and fearlessness while exploring alone. Imagine an imaginary biopic about the life of pop star Madonna with Guy Richie as her Svengali, the man behind her career, and you'll get a sense of how seriously flawed and imaginary The movie is: It can only work if you do not have it absolutely no knowledge of the subject, or just choose to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because once you remove all reference to Diane Arbus, this movie could have taken itself as an interesting study on fetishism and a nice addition to the secretary. 4/10
