There's nothing particularly unique or interesting about this low-budget sci-fi movie. Regardless of its pedigree origin (the film is loosely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and general themes of this film are not in a remarkable or original way, science is weak at best and unfortunately the film does not can even involve convincing action sequences. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and although the main plot does not actually begin to roll until the ship lands, most of the more interesting scenes take place along the way. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers touch each other, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculation about cosmology and the meaning of life, and all that is interesting about the film, give way to a just remotely coherent plot about the Martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not webs of very convincing deception. <br /> <br /> There is also nothing extraordinary about the quality of the film's production. It is acceptable. And most of the acting is, although slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually very good and plays a nice character. I think the best quality of this film, from my perspective, is its fashion sense. The Martians have really cool clothes! If this movie had a point, it could have been a lot more interesting. Oh well.
