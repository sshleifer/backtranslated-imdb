Chapter One: Once upon a time ?? At A Table (1941) <br /> <br /> In which a German Nazi and a French dairy farmer talk for 20 minutes at a table; first in French, then in English. <br /> <br /> Chapter Two: Three Years of Inglourious Basterds in Sixteen Minutes ... No Tables (Mainly) <br /> <br /> In which an American Lieutenant speaks to his newly formed Jewish- American male of 8 men. There are no tables present. Cut to Adolf Hitler three years later. He is angry with his men's inability to deal with the bastards. Hitler has a table. We returned to the Bastards in a flashback. Again, distinct lack of table-based content. <br /> <br /> Chapter Three: German Night in Paris ... On a Table ... Speaking <br /> <br /> In which a Jewess who escaped under the table in Chapter One somehow managed to get herself become the owner of a cinema. The Jewish woman talks to an actor at a table in a bar. Later, the Jewish woman, the actor Joseph Goebbels and a translator talk at a table in a restaurant. The actor and Goebbels speak German. The translator translates German into French. The Jewish woman answers in French. The translator translates French into German. Goebbels decides to make a film debut for the Jewish woman. The actor and Goebbels leave. The Nazi (who talked to the dairy farmer at a table for twenty minutes in chapter one) arrives. He talks to the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman collapses; overcome with emotion by having spent so much time talking at a table. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In which Austin Powers sends a British officer to join the bastards and an actress on a mission to speak German at a table in a tavern. After 21 minutes talking at a table, they all kill themselves. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying down at a talking table. <br /> <br /> Chapter Five: Revenge of the Giant Table <br /> <br /> In which, the Bastards decide to continue the operation speaking in Italian and suicide bombing the cinema. The Nazi takes the actress to a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe he found under the table in the tavern fits her, so he kills her. Then he takes two of the Basterds to a large room, where they sit and talk at a table. Meanwhile, the cinema burns, Hitler is full of bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up without good reason. <br /> <br /> The End
