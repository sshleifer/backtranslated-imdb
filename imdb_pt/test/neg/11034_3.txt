What did Rajiv Rai do to himself? Once, a successful director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is making one bad movie after another. I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre, but that soon disappeared. As a fan of Rajiv Rai, I thought I should at least try, but I left after an hour. One of the reasons I left the movie so early, then the amount of flirting in the movie, this was not in Rai's previous venture. <br /> <br /> Many directors tried to flirt Japan, but I did not expect from Rajiv Rai. Another disappointment was the music. Rajiv Rai has always had good music so far. There is only good music and this is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not so good, not even Rai Loyalist Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Avoidable rate at one time my favorite director.
