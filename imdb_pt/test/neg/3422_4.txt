Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Since then many other versions of the play have been produced, including the remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth. in 1957, entitled "Kumonosu j√¥". The play begins with King Duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle with the Irish and Norwegians. After a quick promotion from Duncan, Macbeth instantly has a strange sense of lust, greed and power and does all he can to get access to the crown: even if it includes murder. Geoffrey Wright attempted to create his own version of the famous play in 2006, placing it in the modern underworld of Melbourne. Imagine a humble Macbeth killing hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 and making his own version of "Low" at the same time. Joking about the latter, but one thing he does is pronounce the traditional Shakespeare. And it continues throughout the film. That's right! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. It's all you could hope for! Not?? The younger Macbeth is violent and violent enough to match any other modern action movie but lacks decent acting, the right jargon, and a good camera work technique. The modernized film begins with Macbeth (Sam Worthington), who works as a drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug dealer in Melbourne, Australia. After being promoted to the Thane of Glamis by Duncan (as the three witches had predicted), the aspiration begins to take care of Macbeth when he fixes his eyes on the throne. After promoting Macbeth, Duncan invites himself to Macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the festivities begin, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) tells Macbeth to kill Duncan to take power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone is asleep, Macbeth enters Duncan's room and stabs him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all of Duncan's belongings, including the title and the hidden crown. As soon as he thinks he has what he wanted, he finds that it will take more than a bribe and escape to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> One major flaw of the film was acting. A Macbeth, once seemingly extravagant and powerful, suddenly turns into a sissy. And he looks like a sad puppy all through the movie. I do not really know if this was Worthington or Wright's fault, but either way, one of the two should have realized that Macbeth was a king, not a knot in a log that carried everything his wife had to say literally. As I said before, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant, and spiteful. But when your character changes to a drug dealer, he changes personality too, I suppose. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to clean it by the roots when it came to recognizing and embodying her character. She did not look as spiteful as in the 1971 part or version, but Macbeth reminded her that, compared to murder, anything else he could do, would not suit her very well. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found unpleasant was all nudity. This had been Wright's fault. The witches did not do a bit of acting unless you call them parading in their acting birthday suit. At one point in the film, I began to wonder if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Position Vol. 2. Do not get me wrong when I say Shakespearean dialogue is out of place. It is spoken without fail, but when it is spoken by an Australian gangster, it is really very strange. When Macbeth begins to kill people, he first informs them, talking to them in Ye Olde English. Macbeth contains a lot of action, blood, blood and nudity to last a lifetime. You forget all the positive facts when you start thinking to yourself, "Okay, what the hell did he just say in the last sentence?" At some point in the movie, I do not even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age of the film could have been easily ripped out, but not for "Thou's" and "Thee's." <br /> <br /> The camera work was simply fair to me. One thing I could not stand was the constant rhythm between the characters. The camera technique used gave Blair Witch some sort of vibration and made me vomit a bit in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to try the same concept of camera work, but that just does not work. It makes me want to get out of the chair and look around, looking for the little beard bags that they have conveniently planted in all the seats of the airplanes. <br /> <br /> Looking back, the gangster 'Macbeth has a positive: a lot of action. Other than that, the film contains nothing more than an uninspired performance, the correct use of English and the camera work that revolves the stomach. The soundtrack contains one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. There is never an interesting or catchy media variation used. From now on, directors must leave the dangerous underworld of the drug to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Future versions of Macbeth must be created exactly as Shakespeare intended the piece to be 400 years ago. I would recommend wearing medieval clothes, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But anyway, modern Macbeth makes you yearn for good folk music, a campfire, and a bustier.
