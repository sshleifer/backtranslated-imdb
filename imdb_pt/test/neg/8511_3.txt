I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer when Jim Salter filmed Three. <br /> <br /> I made some pictures for him, one of which I was told was the movie poster. I did not see the movie until years later. I thought it was bad. Too bad, because the elements that were for him were compelling. Robie Porter's girlfriend was as beautiful as Rampling. Salter asked if I would be around and would be an extra cameraman so they did not have to shoot everything twice. I said yes, but I had to go back to NY, promising to return. I never came back. One of the unknown melodies of life. <br /> <br /> I wish I could post the photos I did somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
