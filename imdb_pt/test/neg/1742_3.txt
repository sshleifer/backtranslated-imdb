I thought it was weird and just bloody, not scary. I saw some of the Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon, and I loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. He never explained anything about the curse. I just did not see any horror ... it was not scary for me. The whole time I was watching, I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why this was happening now. If this was an old curse, why did not this happen before Shuichi's father? And that never told us what happened to her father. I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it was over. I was very disappointed.
