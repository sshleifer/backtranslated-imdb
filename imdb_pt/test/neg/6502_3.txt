Let me say from the beginning that I am not a very artistic person and I do not "get" new art. That said, this movie is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion it's not crazy in a good way. Filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, Avida is a movie for anyone who can look at modern art and say "wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting". The only reason I give this movie a 3 out of 10 is because I actually managed to laugh at some parts, albeit mostly laughing at the sheer insanity of the movie. Two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, like doing what these characters were doing, I have no idea. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
