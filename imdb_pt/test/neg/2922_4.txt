This movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I'll talk about why but first it gets four stars and should stay in four stars because of the ridiculously insipid directors portrayal of rape and sexual assault. Not far from the movie, Oyama sexually harasses a woman he rescued earlier, and while she briefly gets offended by his actions, this attitude lasts only about five minutes before she loves worship and brings her character to the rest of the film. I know many will argue that it's not that important in a Kung Fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genre I can not say it's all so unusual, but that does not stop it from being completely insipid every time I see that. What I'm going to say in the defense of the movie, however, is that it's a bit refreshing to see martial arts, or even action movies of any kind, that offer no real hero to the viewer staying behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a social outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being killed by the police. The final photos of the film leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a major collapse and does not seem to care about the woman he previously attacked to love him and has followed him with a dog-dog devotion . If this was the real message of the film, we can not help but feel a little hopeful that Oyama might be on the verge of suicide when the movie is over. This is a rare emotional treatment of the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a movie that leaves you with the feeling that your violence should not be celebrated. If only the Karate Bullfighter had better dealt with the issue of sexual violence, whether it created more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or putting them all aside, this would be a much more interesting film.
