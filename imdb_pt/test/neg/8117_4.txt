Almost everything Stephen King has ever written seems to have been turned into a movie or television series; in fact, I'm surprised no one has tried to make a miniseries from the guy's grocery list. Let's face it, if they did, it could not be less interesting than Sons of Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of King's many tales, this 1984 horror movie sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing a couple on a long drive that comes up against a problem when they run into the sleepy the city of Gatlin in Nebraska, where all adults were murdered by children who love an ancient evil that hides in the cornfields. <br /> <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch manages to build a good amount of atmosphere in the beginning (after the silly music and dance of Hamilton, but before we meet the bizarre Isaac, leader of the murderous boys), he explodes completely with endless uninteresting scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted by the town's homicidal tights. Courtney Gains, like the violent redhead Malachai, can seem genuinely menacing, but the rest of the children are not at all menacing; As a result, many of the movie's "scary" moments do not work. At the end of the movie, when we finally got to see the malevolent force that inhabits the countryside around Gatlin, the movie descends into an overflow of terrible visual effects of the 80s that probably seemed quite ropey almost 25 years. but it seems positively laughable nowadays. Corn Sons may be of interest to King's fans eager to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but his fan of horror films will be more impressed.
