For three quarters of an hour, the story gradually develops toward a crux of some sort. Although overwhelmed with scenes that seem intent on annoying the viewer and drawing him away from the actual plot, there is something going on. Not much and certainly not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and story-driving scenes adds no depth or insight to the entire cast of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile, since there is no development of any character. Everyone keeps turning and centered around their own cliché and paper - the cute and stubborn girl; the überwoman fighter, the aristocratic snob. The male protagonist does not seem to have any distinction; he is a perfunctory presence, which, in fact, does not matter how he is there just because the storyboard required him to show up - it looked like he was on vacation and was caught up. When it comes time to turn the corner in terms of what is happening, the film first gets completely empty for a few minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or rather dissolves - with a Deus Ex Machina in writing, more clichés and some of the cruelest devices and choices I've ever seen. It's history, fine. First, the film is a drama, although it must be comic, and then it turns into a farce. The protagonists do what they must do and there are no surprises. The first set of somewhat serious antagonists, however, is replaced by a couple who were literally bored. Maybe this was some kind of nod to the audience. <br /> <br /> This film receives no bonus from me for an underlying philosophical meaning (since there is none) nor for its technical realization. The animation and editing are fair and therefore the sound mixing; but it is by no means remarkable or even above the average of the Japanese productions of the late 80's. In fact, the visual tricks seem static, uninspired and unoriginal. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that he can not entertain even if you do not mind characters and all those things. There is very little happening here, and the rest is tacky at best. Get a real Ghibli instead, have a banquet with this and keep your fingers off this.
