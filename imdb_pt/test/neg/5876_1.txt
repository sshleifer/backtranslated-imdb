The only good thing this movie did was that it left me hungry for ice cream, without its dead parts. The film is one of the most cheesy I've seen in a long time. When the "Ice Cream King" dies in the beginning, I was laughing so hard because the boy took his ice cream and started to eat it. His mother asked him to say something and should have said, "Leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so I can watch my actor's career down the drain at a young age." That looks right for a line. Then I wondered why the prince of the ice cream was behind the bars of his ice cream truck. Would someone steal it from your twenty cents? I've never seen bars in an ice cream truck window. He looked very stupid. You can also forget the acting because it is horrible. Forget this movie and go to the dairy queen to get an ice cream.
