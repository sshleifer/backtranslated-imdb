The only people I would recommend this movie are blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sitter would like it. This movie had nothing; no acting, terrible music, horrible script - just the power to suck any happiness from your soul. You may be wondering now why or even how I managed to sit for the whole hour and a half of sheer inanity, and honestly it's a difficult concept for myself. In the first place, I had to walk from side to side as the film progressed, as I found it extremely difficult to be comfortable. Secondly, I just did it without biting my own arm in order to have something to kill me to death through phone calls for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was that it was a source of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes, and that was a fatal mistake on my behalf. I usually like movies to leave you with something at the end, but all this has been done ... For the sake of your sanity, do not watch this movie.
