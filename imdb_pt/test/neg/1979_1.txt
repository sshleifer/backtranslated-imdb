Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will continue to be a classic example of style over substance that went awry. Instead of taking advantage of the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix produced a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa knows Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to change by the second? Can that Cloud effortlessly suspend itself in the air for a minute while uncontrollably swinging with its 2-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. Although not badly notorious, it is far from being well produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. <br /> <br /> Here's what I'd like to say to the diehard FFVII fans who can not stop fudging this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have expected from Square Enix, but even a CG movie like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due course. The days of its newness are numbered. <br /> <br /> Movies like Advent Children make me wonder if Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offense), it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can offer fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly superficial. They are absolute psychopaths, however, when it comes to quality of production. Advent Children features some of the most impressive renders in CG history, but this does not save him from his complicated plot and cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> Any fan who accompanied this movie knows that Sephiroth comes back. Doubling the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The only point I give to this "movie" is in homage to the 10,000 slaved Japanese entertainers who gave their lives to make every blonde hair bleached. on the effeminate white head of Cloud.
