I can laugh at almost everything, but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb !!!! I honestly watched this movie from start to finish, and did not even smile. I'm shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade, etc. would put their names on this crap. Worse than the worst that has ever come out of the worst that has ever come out of the old SNL players. What else can I say? How could such an extremely bland boredom come from such a group of apparent talent !! Maybe I've lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but I do not remember a movie that I did not like so much in a long time. What a waste of 2 hours I will never go back.
