Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the movie store to rent a movie. I like stupid horror movies, so I saw the variety of terrible movies they had to offer while he went out in search of Michael Moore's 'Sicko'. So I found the worst of them all (as I would soon find out). It looked good on the cover and the description on the back looked decent enough. The fact that there was a quote from IMDb as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. So the next night we put it on the DVD player and for the first five minutes we got so incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> The movie is totally incoherent, with misplaced time jumps from the past to the future that leave you wondering a big 'WTF? The plot does not have any kind of coherent story - other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but that only comes into the picture in the last twenty minutes. So, practically in the first hour you have this: a random and confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who do not grow old; poor performance; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes the color of his hair; and a series of nasty characters for you to get bored! <br /> <br /> The movie moves so slowly that it is a difficult task to sit there and watch. I'd rather be scrubbing the bathrooms, honestly. Do not bother with that.
