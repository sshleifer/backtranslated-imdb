I saw this movie once in a children's matinee at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959 when it was released and I was 11 years old. It was one of the three features that were shown that day. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it since, but I wanted to because I'm a movie buff and I appreciate the awful thing along with the big, good and medium movies. <br /> <br /> What I most vividly remember is that the most sophisticated audience members, consisting of children ages 8 to 15, howled with laughter at the tree monster. <br /> <br /> A triple bill in a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget, but I can not remember the names of the other 2 movies. (One of them starred George Montgomery and David Farrar.) UPDATE: The other 2 films from this triple project were much better. They were "Watusi," 1959 with George Montgomery and David Farrar starring and "The Raven Red Planet," 1959 with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden watching. Mrs. Hayden wrote some books on health and fitness as well.
