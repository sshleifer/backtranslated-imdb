This movie could be so much better if they did not use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they did not start the movie with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were many double crosses and twists to make the movie believable. The movie deserves a 0, but since there is no 0, I gave it a 1. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, I would rather poke my eyes with some rusty scissors from the who watch this movie again. I'm telling you, this was an hour and a half of my life, I will not be back. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, do not get it. Watch "Going Off Big Time" or "Lock, Stock and two barrels of smoking" instead.
