Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can not believe it was directed by Wajda. There is virtually no plot and 90% of the film consists of several people coming and going on the screen, faintly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes at the end, but at that time I just stopped caring when trying to stifle my yawns. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole film is filmed with a handheld camera, which supposedly convey the feeling of "personal immediacy", but there is nothing personal or immediate about most of the film. Instead, the camera's constant movement made me sick. To be fair, there are also great photos (no pun intended), but nothing that makes you stay "Wow!". <br /> <br /> If you're not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the movie will come out. You're scratching your head. If you are familiar, you will be scratching your head too, though perhaps for different reasons. Basically, the film repeatedly affirms and reaffirms that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is repeated as if one in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in the other camps of Soviet prisoners of war were not harmed and were released in 1941. It has also never been adequately explained how many people have died, although the number 20,000 has been thrown a couple of times. <BR>> The performance is adequate, with only Komorowska (old) and Chyra (Lieutenant Jerzy) giving noticeable performances, but they can perform for perhaps 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matinee appearance than for their acting skills, but I will not mention their names. Suffice it to say that they definitely are not the Oscar material, so any claim that this movie was "stolen" from the Oscar is simply laughable. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is also wrong. On the one hand, it tries to be a precise historical drama, on the other, it resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, like showing a Russian soldier ripping the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some intriguing scenes that have absolutely no impact on the plot, such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the University of Krakow. <br /> <br /> There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting. , such as adding a political angle to history, or showing the German discovery of graves, or even portraying Anna's trip from the occupied Soviet part to German-occupied Krakow. All of these aspects could have been the greater part of the film, but were reduced to a few minutes. In the end, we have a collection of loose, confusing and boring scenes about the reaction of the Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of World War II. Not very attractive and not worthy of Wajda at all.
