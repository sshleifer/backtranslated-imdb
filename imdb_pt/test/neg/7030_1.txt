I did not think this movie was very good. Basically, they took a lot of phrases from various Shirley Temple movies, put them together and made Orr act like Shirley Temple acting on screen. "O my God!" was said several times. If you are familiar with the Shirley Temple movies, you will recognize several lines directly from your movies. The problem is that they have Orr saying that in Shirley's everyday life. In the end, what we have is a miscellany of films recreated from Shirley Temple, rather than any kind of real look at the life of Shirley Temple. Save your work and rent movies from Shirley Temple, it's so much better than watching Orr try to recreate Shirley's acting style.
