This movie made me so angry because of your stupidity that I felt the need to create a IMDb account to share my opinion with you. I liked Ashton Kutcher in "Much like love" and that's why I still wanted to see this movie despite its current rating of 4.2. It is highly rated. I trusted that an actor (any one of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in a low-quality production. It's very disappointing. The home-sitting theme was much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that did not make sense here: first of all, the owner of the house leaves his precious pet with someone who knows nothing about taking care of him. Second, the rule is not to let anyone in the house, but the home owner does not follow this simple rule. The door is not locked? And so on..
