One of the worst theatrical films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins lowers himself by appearing in this joke. I can not believe that the name of David Mamet and Ridley Scott appears in this farce. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was to refuse this. Julianne Moore was as emotionless as a Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the makeup is so good that I did not know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars ?? Give me some time! Rumor has it he did not want his name even mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding his own brain to Ray Liotta ... I was laughing at the absurd, do not do that stupid thing about this movie right now. I have not seen so many people coming out of a movie since Who's That Girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone to go to you if you need but miss this at ALL COSTS !!!
