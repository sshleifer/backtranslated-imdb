A new guard in the armored truck is recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. No thugs, so no one's going to get hurt, right? Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and fix things by saving the life of a dying man. <br /> <br /> I admit that I really had no interest in it. film, but I also had no interest in Fantastic Mr Fox, and this movie made my top ten of the year. Armored is even more a disappointment, so I thought it would be. As an assault movie, he can not deliver the products, it's boring and full of holes in the plot and jumps in logic that will hurt him thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie somehow has a very good cast. , but the movie does not even use it to your advantage. Everyone seems lost in wooden characters who make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting leadership that is never charismatic and never makes the public want to suck. Matt Dillon is the brain behind the robbery and he plays Mr. Nice Guy in the beginning, so when things do not happen, he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the impressive cast includes Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco of Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia of Heros. Neither of them does much and when they actually do something, it's without much reasoning behind it. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even with its run time less than 90 minutes, it has been dragged out. How long can you make a movie about a guy stuck somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and was even more restricted. The leaps of logic about the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are check-ins every hour or so? The whole plan of my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to get hit and burn the trucks. They would then leave with the money. Of course something goes wrong, or there would be no movie right? Through a series of unfortunate events, the so-called hero was trapped inside the truck with a wounded officer. The rest of the film is Dillion and his team knocking on the doors to enter. How very exciting. <br /> <br /> The script asks our hero to have financial problems, he can lose his house, which would in turn make him lose his brother. You see, both parents died and it's just the two of them looking at each other. So now he has a reason to join the robbery. At first he did not want to come in, but his financial problems were just the right impetus to throw him in the middle of things. How convenient. All Armor's turn in the assault genre is that it's from an armored truck, from the guys who drive it. After this basic premise, the film falls flat on the floor. I found myself wanting it to end more and earlier each time someone spoke. Speaking of the end, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
