I have to say that there is a redemptive particle in relation to this "movie". Establish firmly the bottom of the barrel. Now, filmmakers know what to point up when making a movie. Besides, I'm sorry to see this mess. How shameful to abandon the production of this "movie" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's it folks, 100% of dollars). This "movie" reminds me of the "Adult Video Awards" program, in which the group of "industrial prostitutes" self-praise, believing to be real actors, actresses and filmmakers. Ironic, then, as I watched blue movies with better acting, direction and writing. I also found it funny that the executive producer, Justin Ament, just had to be in the "movie". He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I'm sure your acting career has taken off ... Ted Pfiffer, the writer, has a part. He was undoubtedly wallowing in the clich√© glory he created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea has a leading role in the film. You can remember her from the "Elephant" of Gus Van Sant. Although I'm not sure she'll want to write this movie on her resume. And I'm not sure which is a most depressing point; money was spent to make this movie or people will watch it. Along with 'Torque', 'Godsend' and 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow', one of the worst films, IF NOT THE BEST MOVIE, 2004.
