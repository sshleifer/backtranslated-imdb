I loved the first Grudge, I watched in an empty theater, and in all honesty, I was terrified. Never before had I heard the unique sound of chilling sounds, it was really exciting. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2, however, had a couple of good jumps, but the actual plot was confusing, and not entirely believable, and all over the place, with some scenes (like a woman peeing in fear , or another one from a young woman drinking a jug of milk and puking it all over again) which really did not make sense, and did not help improve the film's creep factor. During these scenes, and a few others, people in the exhausted audience actually laughed out loud. This was a good indicator to show how this movie had no emotions, chills or chills. The acting was decent, the emotions portrayed were plausible, so I took off the actors' hat, but the messy plot and lack of direction were something I could not shake all through the movie. I was more irritated than anything, the same loud grunts, some unexpected quick scenes to make me jump, but overall, I was very disappointed.
