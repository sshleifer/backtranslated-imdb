This episode sucks. <br /> <br /> In recent years I've watched all the episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and now I'm watching "Enterprise." <br /> <br /> I'm completely enjoying this series. Until this episode. I looked at the screen with horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It's more like an attempt at clowning. <br /> <br /> He does not build the characters, but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience panting. Does little to build the series. <br /> <br /> Why was this allowed to air to surprise me. Was it the writing? Was it the direction? Was the producer? We'll probably never know. <br /> <br /> But a rotten apple is not bad, I suppose. I say I hope it's just one.
