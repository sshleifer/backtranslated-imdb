* The elite ELITE sniper team who entered 24 hours or more before, instead of digging and becoming invisible, decided to hide behind a large rock in one of the first scenes. * When the hero "runs" to rescue his wife, he really runs. * When inside a building and aiming at a target only 20-30 meters away, the hero USE YOUR SCOPE. Apart from the fact that most non-elite soldiers would do this hip shot and still knock, there is also the fact that the telescope would probably not be able to focus so close. * There is a satellite that can actually look horizontally at buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest pile of crap I've ever put on my DVD player.
