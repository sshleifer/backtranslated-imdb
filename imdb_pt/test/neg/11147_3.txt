The plot of this boils down to Ah-nuld against Satan, and what I remember most about the movie is a bunch of explosions, shots, blood, noise, and let's not forget that satanic flammable urine. The story is nonsense, totally predictable and so full of holes I could not take a little seriously. Stay with "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a really good devil movie and ... um, well, I can not think of any good "Action" movies at the moment (probably because they re so far and few among), then you are on your own in that category. This movie gets a rating of 3 out of 10 for me for its camp value, and for a very good performance by Gabriel Byrne like that old debb Satan!
