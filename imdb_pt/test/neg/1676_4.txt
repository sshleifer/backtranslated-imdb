A child puppeteer for a children's public access program goes to the bottom of the pit when he discovers that children he entertains in a hospital have been victims of horrific abuse. This movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could find. It is not as much of an exploration film as a special post-school on the dangers of child abuse. Apparently harmless, Rabby takes things on his own when it appears that the police are castrated for lack of evidence to convict repugnant parents of their terrible abuses against their children. Children are emotionless and zombie-like (... because of the amount of abuse inflicted on them), noisy parents, inconceivably harsh, despicable and bellicose. Mothers, in particular, are so obscene that you will twist their execution. They are essentially miserable people taking their frustrations out on children. Our detectives are very tired, frustrated with the whole judicial process, as the police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat up their children. Although the crimes themselves are heinous, the film does not explicitly elaborate the hideous activity on the screen. I would say the reason to see this is for the performance of Tom Basham as the unbalanced man-child who goes into psychosis. There is a strange sequence of dinner table between Mr. Rabbey de Basham and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for his son's death, about how he lives in a fantasy and how he had just done left an indelible mark (.notice the changes in behavior, quite impressive work, going from innocent to scary). Peter Renaday is Lieutenant Hayes, the detective in charge of homicide cases, expressing in his face the tension that is taking hold of him. There is an initial performance of John Ashton as Detective Matthews, always arousing Hayes's anger over his inability to follow instructions, not to mention how opinionated he is toward parents who abuse their children. Relaxed and sloppy scoreboard that looks unfit for a movie like this. Controversial conclusion that even children can only tolerate much. Slightly moving to my taste, but there is an effective use, I felt, of Basham's eyes before he takes care of the business, waiting patiently as he prepares to attack.
