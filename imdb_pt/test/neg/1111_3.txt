The concept of this film is quite convincing: zombie kids coming out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the interior of Pennsylvania. Nice. The problem I had with the film is the lack of creativity in dealing with zombies. The creators could have really tempered this movie with some terrifying images like "The Ring", like stop action, reverse camera walking or things like that. When zombie kids are strolling through the woods, they look like a bunch of 9-year-old boys walking to a playground in western Philadelphia. Instead of picking up axes and shovels, they could easily carry baseball bats and gloves. Why would I fear these little children? Anyone could run straight for safety. Besides, who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that sinister, decaying house? The moment I opened the front door and looked around, I would have said, "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Son, go and turn the car in. I'm coming back to pee in a bush and then we're out of here." unbelievable. Do not waste your time.
