There are so few movies in which only the title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. Such a film is I was a Communist For The FBI. Another example would be I married a monster from outer space. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie is how, in the name of heaven, was this named for an Oscar in the documentary category? It is not a documentary in any sense of the word, not even in this hybrid category of docudrama. It's just a very exploratory film about the work of an FBI undercover agent named Matt Cvetic who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and made an effort to take over the Metalworkers Union for the Communists and report on their activities to their FBI manipulators. <br /> <br /> A documentary of this work may have been interesting, but what we got was a movie to fit into those paranoid times. I found it fascinating that, when Cvetic finally broke the lid, he went to the House's Anti-American Activities Committee instead of the New York trial of Communist Party leaders. There was a moment in the film in which the head of the communist James Millican told his followers to start spreading the word that the American Activities Committee of the House was composed of a bunch of right-wing yahoos trying to get their names in front of the camera. Now, what could have given you that idea? Anyway, just connect the dots and no doubt their word came from J. Edgar Hoover trying to give some credit to the HUAC for having an effective disguise coming up instead of a real judgment. Small thing there called crossed interrogation. Warner Brothers who produced I was a communist for the FBI later produced Big Jim McLain who starred John Wayne about a HUAC investigator in Hawaii. The HUAC was able to credit the work done by the Honolulu PD by dividing a communist espionage ring among the stevedores. But at least in John Wayne's film no one claimed it was a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy is in the title role as Cvetic and his FBI handlers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a teacher at the Pittsburgh school who says that about 30 years ago, as here, in that school system that teaches young people, including Ron Hagerthy, son of Lovejoy. She has a change of opinion about the Communists and Lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by her superiors. Ironically, Hart left the theater and went to work everywhere, the United Nations which, as we all know, has often been accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br /> <br /> More than half a century later, we actually have very few objective or printed works on the US Communist Party. They were indeed a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes in stopping them were the organizers of the work, such as Walter Reuther at the UAW or David Dubinsky at ILGWU. But as they were left-wing people, they just do not have the right to be proper propaganda material. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was a Communist for the FBI is an explorer job based on a real life. character and a testimony of those paranoid times.
