It is beyond me that two million Danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible spectacle. The dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are empty and simplistic. There is a tough man, a tough woman, and a sensitive man. The writers say they modeled the characters after Greek mythology! Give me some time! All the characters are, of course, brilliant cops. When I watched this show, I craved "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue." These are brilliant shows, and "Rejseholdet" is a bad copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish television is currently suffering from.
