A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of an H-bomb explosion that ends in the world. Not only do they fear the radiation, but also the mutants on the surrounding slope. One of the group is already contaminated but strangely poses no real threat to others. Just surviving the attrition of several personalities up close is the sub-plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is near the edge throwing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to begin to populate a brave new world. Not one of Roger Corman's best. This is a predictable black and white science fiction.
