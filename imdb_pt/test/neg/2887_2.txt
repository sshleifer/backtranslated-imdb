Again, it is not bad enough to make it enjoyable. In fact, this is just annoying. It's reasonably well done, even if the script is bad, the effects are good and the acting average. (In addition to James Mason, which is always great, but this underutilized) <br /> <br /> I suppose it's hard to write anything about this movie because it did not evoke any reaction in me than ever. without shine, without shine, without shine, without shine, without shine.
