What really surprised me about this movie was that it sounded so fake. First of all, who in the late 80's (when the movie happens) lived like this family? A college professor would not make enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in the movie. So he and his wife at home would be plagued by financial problems, especially when she gets cancer. Secondly, Streep is my age, and most women, particularly in their class (educated, white, well-being), experienced the feminist movement. However, this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior. I really felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child, taking care of all her needs. <br /> <br /> The fact that so many people have been moved by the film is incredible. I've admired Carl Franklin's movies in the past, and I really like Meryl Streep, but damn it, what a manipulative and lying liar is that.
