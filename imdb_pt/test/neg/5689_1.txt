OK, please believe me when I say this is a terrible and terrible science fiction movie. It is so poorly done that much of the film presents itself as unintentional surrealism and is absolutely a waste of 100% time. Horrible, but somehow also deeply bland. I watched this as a double feature with "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior movie, that's not saying much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so completely complicated that it is impossible to follow. The narration is puzzling, often meaningless, seemingly endless and exhaustively exhaustive. Literally half the film are duplicate scenes of the female protagonist, who looks like Brian Bosworth, walking through the desert. The movie really starts out really cool, but then plunges into pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. Absolutely awful and truly an Absurdist Endurance Test. Zero stars. --- | Reviews by Flak Magnet
