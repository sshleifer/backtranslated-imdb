This is a beautiful run of the mill family movement that I'm sure most kids will enjoy but with really not much to please any adults viewing the movie. The premise of the film is that Belushi's police character retires but is drawn into a case that results in him becoming a private investigator. The plot of the film is so obvious that most children will certainly choose the ending before it happens. But in addition, there seems to be forgotten story arches and subplots as the film progresses. This added to a sub-plane where the titular K-9 is attacked by Belushi. One to be avoided, I'm scared.
