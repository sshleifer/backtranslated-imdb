I saw this movie years ago, 8 years ago, when it was first released, and the only memories I have about it are: 1. That was awful. 2. That in a scene Linnea Quigley applies sunscreen on her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes in a row (she looked so long so). 3. A scene in which a character gets a sledgehammer hit his head. In this scene, when the hammer connects, the head breaks like glass. Is very bad.
