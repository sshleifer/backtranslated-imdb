I was watching TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm, which I liked in films like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It all started well, but you could tell that the story was missing and, in half, began to deteriorate. I do not remember this movie being in theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it would not be long. The acting was obsolete and unconvincing, the dialogue was foolish and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I like movies like those that were compared to Fight Club, but this one does not come close !! Heather Grahm has done much better things ever since. I gave a 2 out of 10, but this because I clicked on the wrong number, I wanted to give a 1.
