This was undoubtedly the worst movie I ever watched. And that's saying a lot because I've seen my share of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen a movie in which each character portrayed was a less intelligent loser. Seriously, there was no respectable character in the entire script. How fitting is that the plot was equally lame, with no intelligence at all. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would agree to participate in such stupidity. And while I have not seen all of his other films, I've always enjoyed his performances so far. It was not that acting was bad, only the whole story was stupid.
