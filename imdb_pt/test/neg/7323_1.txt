Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and false. It is the same on and off the screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves in exactly the same way as in the movies. Their silly facial expressions make me want to change channels. She was in two good movies, but it would have been better if someone had been cast for the role. Steve Martin also does not add much to the film. He also acts and also ruins an old favorite. The ridiculous part of Martin Short only adds more idiocy to the film. I tried watching the movie twice but both times had to be turned off.
