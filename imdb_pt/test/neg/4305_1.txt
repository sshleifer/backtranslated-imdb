I rented this tonite from my local video store. It was titled "Black Horizon." I think someone felt that this was good enough for a 2004 revival ... Micheal Dudikoff is not, unfortunately, a ninja in this movie, one of the main flaws of this film right out of the blue. Another major flaw would be that Ice-t's action scenes are stolen from other films, particularly the first scene of his rescue, which is directly from Wesley Snipes's "The Art of War" movie with the Ice-T edited. I hope they paid for that footage. <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible, the special effects had little effort put into them (love those wires that hold them in space), the performance is wood (also loves those New York / Russian accents). Ice-T being in the movie is useless. These guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space, but I think they were not worried about it. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should go back to doing what he is "good" and doing the American Ninja. 6
