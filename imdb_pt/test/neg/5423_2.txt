By all accounts, this series could have been made at any time since the mid-forties. The cardboard sets, the moon kings with spokes sewn into your aprons, you know the drill. This is a Rocky Jones adventure, featuring the business of the space officer with the unbearable Queen Bitch of the planet Offeecious, a planet that will not join the United Planets. When the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that Offeecious is on a collision course with this other vaguely Slavic planet, the Queen of the Bitch decides to blow up the other guys instead of evacuating their lands. This introduces a moral to the effect of "The greatness of a nation is not in their land, but in their people," which is hammered home five or six times in the storm weather. The constant nasal pronouncement of HRC on "OffEEEEcious" provides relief from some seriously desired spatial effects, is this a TV program?
