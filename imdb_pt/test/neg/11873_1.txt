to begin with, I am easily satisfied. I am by no means a true critic, and movies that authentic critics, friends, family and newspapers can find horrible may even be entertaining for me to watch. <br /> <br /> Not this one here though. <br /> <br /> I got it since it was the newest Wesley snipes movie in my DVD store. I like snipes, but this was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> A bad story, bad actors, failures in continuity, bad sound, depressing places, a pseudo-legal snipe, I really had to force myself to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> They still left some marks in the shots where a car should stop. <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about "small production company / young director / low budget" bad medium where you can skip some mistakes because you feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> An action movie that disappoints you like no other in a long time.
