This film was beyond horrible, it was a spine in the a * s of the film industry. I know all movies can not be a hit or even an average, but the responsible parties who joined in for this epic failure should have realized they had a time bomb in their hands. I can not help thinking that the cast would join in the scenes and would be comforted by being in such a heap of dung. I can hear now, "Are you getting paid?" "Not you?" I understand that this movie was more than likely done on a shoe string budget, but even with that taken into account, it could still have been better. You wait for the appearance of a monster / creature and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn. I'm so mad at myself for spending a 1.07 on this stinky !!!
