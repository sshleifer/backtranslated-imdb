I can not beat this movie very terribly, because it's obvious halfway through the time watching it that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. Either way, many of the parts they tried to make funny, in fact, are, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'Space Invaders' game, actually played as real life! Scratch your head on the clumsy robots ... oh, the madness! And watch the whole thing get to the top near the end with the 'time warp'! And the sexual innuendoes just keep flying ... I'm really surprised that this went away with a PG. Oh well. A fun way to waste a few hours, but Star Wars / Trek this is not it, folks. 3 out of 10.
