by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I was kind of looking forward to this. I like Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star makes a vehicle for itself or when someone who writes decides to make their own directorial debut. But when the star's head gets too big for the rest of its body, there's always the danger of a Hollywood budget vanity with big budget. <br /> <br /> Will the filmmaker keep the reality? or would he just waste lots of money (studio money, ours) and time (studio, ours, and his own) banging on his back for an hour and a half? Unfortunately, it's the last one here. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really like is when someone gives new, fresh life to an exhausted, dry genre. None of this here. The movies in nightclub at war have become so worn that even the parodies are sad and dead. <br /> <br /> Murphy does nothing. He does the most cliché: he connects to a conventional image of a formulaic gangster and plays it as seriously as if it were "The Godfather." It's like a script where the next draft, they put the jokes and the new ideas. But it seems that someone with influence just looked at him and it was, "No, that's good." <br /> <br /> Probably Murphy. He is credited in all this. In the opening photo of beautiful white satin sheets, his name gives a headline in the credits about five times. <br /> <br /> THE LOT: A young orphan saves Pryor's life, and Pryor adopts the little ragdoll. <br /> <br /> 20 years later, the Pryor eviction became a first-class hot spot. They are making lots of money and a gangster wants their action. He still has a dirty cop on his job. But Pryor comes up with an outline, "THE STING". <br /> <br /> Murphy's script plays like a first unfinished sketch that no one had the pair to call it. The actors are not allowed to stand out much, if so much. Even the all-powerful Murphy seems to be on autopilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows class and gentlemanly ways like Sugar Ray (maybe it was better to name his BROWN Sugar Ray character - another proof that he needed a polish), but everyone here is basically just vacationing . <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination that the film received is richly deserved (Joe I. Tompkins' Best Costume Design), but production figures are the only part that makes the 1930s feel authentic. <br /> <br /> Some sets look a bit fake, but this should be some kind of comedy. It is rare for a film to be nominated for either a Razzie or an Oscar (unless it is one of the new chapters of Lucas' "Star Wars"). It's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988, particularly the comedians. This is a formula of the prehistoric white man. And with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to spit the genre or at least bring new life to it. No. Murphy is basically a good example of that. <br /> <br /> The great Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he commented in his review: "Murphy addresses his story more as a fantasy party in which everyone looks great while fumbling through a plot that is not fresh since at least 1938. "Jasmine Guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging in her role and Michael Lerner has all the looks, evil and mannerisms of the mafia boss prototypical down pat. And there are times when Pryor gives you an idea of ​​how a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound. It gives each scene a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> Was it too much to ask Della Resse to sing? Or did he at least give up being ashamed of all of his "Kiss My Ass" talk? <br /> <br /> And the late Redd Foxx can not leave much of a swan song here. He has some comings and goings with the Resse, which could have been a great thing. No. Murphy misses another opportunity again here. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and friendly. But those moments are few and far between, for sure. Murphy never looked better and was never duller. Your character made me laugh twice over the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer with a horrible speech problem is not only painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. There is more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant. You have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation. Watching him struggling even for some of the easier words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed at Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write a script? Good?? there was "Raw", but this was actually stand-up stuff. He wrote the sketch for "Boomerang" and "Coming to America" ​​for sure. But she did not have the last word there. Maybe a team of medical writers like ER could have revived this one. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet that you would swear he was sleeping on the wheel most of the time. It has lots of static shots and does not seem to know how to build and release suspense. On some level, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot-headed and ambitious. But occasionally charming. Now, if it was just funny at some point. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where Murphy has a femme in bed who plans to make love to him and kill him. You can probably guess how this happens. Like everything else in the movie, this could have been better, but ?? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly," Murphy has not directed another film since (he received a Razzie nomination). And he no longer writes the draft for his movies (he WON, the Razzie, for writing this!) It's great to see and the music is beautiful, and there are some really cool scenes. But this just falls into the category of "jewelry among all the garbage". Not enough of them. <br /> <br /> It could have been. Should be. It was not. Oh well. <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef
