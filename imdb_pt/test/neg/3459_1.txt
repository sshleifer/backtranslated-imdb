I also made the mistake of thinking that I would see the 2003 Swimming Upstream with Geoffry Rush. That was worse than many student films I've seen. The script was forced, the performance was inferior and the editing annoying. It was so slow that I could force myself to stay. But I always give the movie a chance, so I suffered until the end. Apparently, there was a memo about this movie, because me and my friend were the only ones in the theater. Why did not someone send me this memo?!?! That's why I'm posting as a warning to others who think of spending lots of money to see this. I just hope you have come to this page, and have not got stuck like I was, looking at the wrong "Swimming Upstream". P.S. Sorry for the cast and crew if you are reading this. I know you worked hard to do this. I know what happens in making a movie ... keep trying!
