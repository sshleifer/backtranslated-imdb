The actresses are cute and the sets, although simple, okay. Also, there is nothing to salvage from this movie. Incredibly bad acted, dumb to dialogues of tears, long-awaited plot, a lot of nonsense and inconsistencies (for example, a pretty girl gets banged on the head by a morning star and not only does she survive but barely with a scratch!). .. To make it short, why not worth more, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
