A ripening story of a teenage girl rebelling against the church and her father minister in a small Norwegian village. The countryside is picturesque, but the story is quite pretentious and slow, with much of the film dedicated to quoting scriptures. It's like watching a religious propaganda film. Theisen, who made just another film, is very good as the sensitive young protagonist as well as Sundquist as his stern father and Riise as a woman that Theisen is fascinated. The film purports to be fresh and charming, but looks rather obsolete and tired. Director and co-writer Nesheim, who has worked mostly on TV, is not up to the task.
