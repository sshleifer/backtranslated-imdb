So far I did not like every Jean Rollin movie I've seen, and it always bothered me because it's an acclaimed Euro-trash monument and extremely popular with many regular reviewers on this lovely site; people whose opinions I always value and generally agree. Apparently everyone always seems to point out some gloomy and stylized filming trademarks in their work that are completely lost on me. Rollin's movies are unimaginably boring, all feature the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the wonderful gothic setting is always underused and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a ticket by bus. I had already given up Rollin's repertoire (especially after supporting "The Iron Rose"), until I found out about "Night of the Hunted." Allegedly, this film does not feature any lame lesbian vampire and presents itself as a genuine horror film with repulsive murders and macabre twists. And the verdict is ?? Yes and no! On the one hand, this is undeniably the most attractive and inventive Rollin film I've had the pleasure of seeing so far (and also the only one I watch without snoozing ??). On the other hand, it remains an idiotic movie with a meaningless plot and unemotional sex sequences to make up for stupidity. Jean Rollin tries hard to create an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mainly through the lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but can barely conceal the fact that he does not really have a story to tell. The beautiful and daring actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautifully sinister musical orientation are the only elements that keep her addicted to the screen. During a night trip to Paris, a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and poorly dressed girl who comes running from the forest. Her name is Elisabeth, but in addition, she can not remember anything about herself and what or who she was running from. Her amnesia case is so bad she continually forgets who took it. The next day she is abducted again by an old man and taken to a sinister apartment complex where several people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. Elisabeth does not know anything, but she feels she needs to get away from here. Obviously, I will not disclose the outcome, but I can assure you that it is completely idiotic, illogical, and improbable. Apparently Rollin realized that too, because the explanation is kept very brief and quick. There are a lot of overly weird and meaningless sequences, sex filming is terrible and filmed without passion, the nasty makeup effects seem cheap and randomly played with no real purpose. As said, the score is mesmerizing and the perfect body of Brigitte Lahaie is addictive.
