I was looking forward to this movie. I like traveling thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great soundtrack. And I was especially interested in making the film trip across Europe to see if I recognized any of my own travel spots. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, however, this movie was unattainable. What was Guy doing driving on the wrong side of the road? What could have blown the van that gracefully rolled down into a grassy slope? If they are such bad drivers, why would they have a delivery job? And this is just the first scene! Not bad enough to be overdone or silly. Just horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Waste of time. Change to something ... anything else!
