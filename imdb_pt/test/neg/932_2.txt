It's like someone picking up a fancy-type video game and putting it in the blender, and the resulting confusion in the scene is what we have to do. <br /> <br /> Now, let me register how much I love Chinese Fantasy Films. Fun and silly, for those who focus on martial arts, for the most dramatic and romantic types ?? It's a genre that I really like. Movies like "A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The bride with white hair"; "Butterfly and Sword"; "Green Snake"; "A Chinese Ghost Story"; "Swordsman II"; "Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain"; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"; and others. That's why I was looking forward to "A Chinese Tall Story". One of the characters in the film is the "Monkey King" (also known as Sun Wukong), a character well known in Chinese mythology, first narrated in the stories of "Journey to the West," the epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the "Chinese Odyssey" movies, among many others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So how does everything go wrong? Well, let's give a familiar example to the western audience. How about the mythology of Robin Hood? A well-known story from the old days. Let's say our Robin Hood movie starred Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's give Sir Robin a Uzi too, because you never know when you'll have to squander the sheriff of Nottingham. They may need packets of rockets as well, and while we're at it, give them a nuclear tactical weapon because that could certainly come in handy. If you think this sounds like a very cool rereading of Robin Hood's tale, then "A Chinese Tall Story" is the movie for you! As I pointed out above, this movie is a messy mess. In the first 30 minutes, we are introduced not only to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also to monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "millennium bug" (which shoots laser beams ), a subterranean tree god, a lizard tribe, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor's turtle, a Dragon King of the Sea, a magic gold team, a talkative impostor girl, earthworm holes in space, and Four heavenly horsemen. All of this would not be so bad - tales and myths passed over the years certainly have all sorts of fantastic elements. But I assure you that Chinese mythology does not include much of the material to which we submit in the last half of the film. (A helpful advice to filmmakers: Just because their computer effects faces may come with cool spacecraft and intergalactic war representations, does not mean they owe.) <br /> <br /> You know your movie mythology Chinese is in when the director asks (and I'm not making this up? it's a direct quote from the comment) "I asked the composer whether or not we could have a rock-and-roll type of music when it turns into some sort of thing similar to an android. " Is there a hidden story here somewhere? Yes. Yes it does. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse's "Gen-X Cops," "Time and Tide," and "Meiyan, the Hangman Girl" (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing in this movie. You may know her as half of the Twins singing group and other films like "The Twins Effect" and "Just One Look." Poor Choi, being an impassioned lizard and all, is hardly recognizable with her warts, ripped teeth, a hooked nose and bent back. That is, until computers get it and embellish it, which somehow makes it worse. Tse is acceptable, but all the supporting actors were lousy. Some recognizable faces in small pieces are wasted. <br /> <br /> At one point I was debating with myself whether "A Chinese Tall Story" was a parody. I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very handsome Fan Bing-Bing) came out and lit a Marlboro (!) While talking to Tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a Spider- Fantasy man's (!!). But this is not a fake. Of course there is the typical nonsense of Hong Kong, but the film takes it seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and ducks (marked by a violent scandal of violins and evocative cellos) and stimulating action and adventure. <br /> <br /> You may think you could watch this on a Netflix rental and it would not cost you anything. (Oh, but this will cost you, alright). <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? Right. The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). And the filmmakers were certainly working hard. Too bad that all this effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.
