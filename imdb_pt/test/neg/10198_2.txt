Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. As a fan of science fiction, the notion of a UFO film interested me. <br /> <br /> Instead, this movie quickly turned out to be an evangelical Christian propaganda film. Suitable for an audience of like-minded but very un-Christian people, they like to explore the mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code did not hold back its madness with wide eyes. So this B-movie production (and I'm being kind) will be appreciated in churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to youth groups on Wednesday and Sunday night. But whether you are a Christian or a non-Christian, you will not feel comfortable.
