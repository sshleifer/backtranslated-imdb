This is a good model for a study of corporate power and the dichotomy between the public life required and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor was prepared by corporate chief Burl Ives as a substitute to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate an agreement, where Taylor is surprised by the ethics and morality of the men with whom he is dealing and manages to fall in love with a refugee while involved. He returns in peace, doing his duty, but having told the truth to the English about his motives. He tries to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece, and thus begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. It could have been grander, more unpleasant and less romantic - the amount of time spent in the novel distorts the movie away from the points it is trying to make about corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the costumes have been nominated (undeservedly for an Oscar - they are all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work once again, CinemaScope in black-and-white cinematography - that's if anything deserved the name of the Oscar (it was MGM's first full-length black-and-white film) Not as good as it could have been, but not terrible either.
