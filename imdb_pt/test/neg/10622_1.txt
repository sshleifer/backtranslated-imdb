This movie made me want to hit my head against the wall. It is difficult to compare such evil as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding under your fingernails. And this comment comes from the writer's cousin. This movie was so bad, that made "Hulk" (The second worst movie ever) looks like "The Departed" (One of the biggest movies in film history). If you like boring family movies with predictable story lines then you will love this movie. If you have a brain then you definitely will not have it. When I rented this movie, I fell asleep while watching it. The next day, I finished where I left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.
