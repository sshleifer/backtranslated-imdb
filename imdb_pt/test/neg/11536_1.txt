I know that when you buy a used DVD (oops, sorry, seen previously) for $ 5.99 you should not have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this poor disc in the box. <br /> <br /> It will give producers credit for providing a complex challenge for the viewer. . . to determine which is the worst, the acting, the script, the work of the camera, the special effects. . . they all practically tie in for simply terrible. Oh, there's the worst fake car accident ever used in a movie anywhere. <br /> <br /> Now all this is very serious ridicule for a movie fan who proudly features 'Police Academy', 'Naked Gun', 'National Lampoon-loaded Gun' and a host of other albums in his collection. But at least these people know that the tongue should be planted firmly on their cheek, the PW cast will unfortunately use their tongues in an attempt to deliver futile And although it is almost unbelievable, movie characters seem to think they may be really doing something of value. A backroom pornographer would be ashamed to release this mess. <br /> <br /> Oh. Lucky I bought the worst video ever made at one time ... "Fraternity Demon" ... maybe the name should have given me a hint.
