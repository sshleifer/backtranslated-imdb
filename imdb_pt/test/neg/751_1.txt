Is it possible to give a score 0 out of 10? Because this deserves it. Although I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I went through this with two women who are. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad that movie is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with some charisma in the whole thing, although he overdoes it as he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But that was not enough to save this stinking man from total suckitude. It's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what's "really" going on, and there are so many holes in the story that you can barely figure out what's going on. Too many loose ends and the end looks like a climax to "tune in again next week". The lead actress is very docile and strange to be a heroine, the protagonist is too dizzy and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the song sounds like some kind of cheap pet design of the director's hippie daughter (I mean saxophone mixed with some sort of female whine operated spacey). So in conclusion, I suggest you write your budget and order a DVD of this as fast as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.
