Contains the Main Spoilers, on the chance you really care about the plot. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker that defeats the power grid. <br /> <br /> Predictable schlock from the start, and if that was not enough, the 5-second action between the movie and the commercials kills the little suspense that could have happened. For example, will they arrive at the airport on time? Things look gloomy when we go to a commercial - and the action is triggered before the ad shows them jumping inside the plane! Well, I think they will do this, after all, but again, they had to because they are good guys. <br /> <br /> The performance was not very impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tornado Tommy), the effects were kind of lame, the thugs did, and the good guys came. The real disaster of this film was the script, especially the ending. Not only did they wrap things up as quickly as a soap opera, given 24 hours notice of cancellation, but they glorified the hacker as well-meaning. So he caused a bazillion deaths ?? he meant well. And, of course, a final TV report about people coming together. Barf. It was all I expected from the commercials, and I'm glad I wasted my time watching. You're going to have a great conversation at the breakfast table tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Is CBS insulting us by doing this? Of course, but we watch, do not we? Did you count out many ads that there were for backup generators at home during this pig? <br /> <br /> Here's the hope for the next Plan 9 of the Outer Space (which looks best with each view). Is not it. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
