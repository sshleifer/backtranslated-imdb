It is unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem to be influenced by previous prejudices. (that is, anger against gay characters, thinking that French thriller films are bad, etc.). I admit that I'm not familiar with the novel, but as a film after about 45 minutes, I was rolling my eyes . I hope I can eloquently explain my grievances in writing before I get tired of spending more time with this movie in the two hours of its run. (2 hours that look like 3) do not get me wrong, I can sit for an hour and a half silent movies, 3 hour epics, I do not have little attention, nor am I so tired of the mtv generation that I can not enjoy a subtle and slow movie. here goes, my shopping list of complaints. first off, the end. yes, it had a scooby-doo-esquire, the character explains everything in the end. Now I really think for this movie, this was necessary .. the movie had so many twists, emotional revelations, new facts popping up and being discovered .. one critic said well: "... yes, it's a very logical story but no the essential story (childhood stories, the relationship between the three parents, the relationship between the two lovebirds and Big Man's son), this does not seem right. I did not put too many spoilers here, I could name specific revelations that I thought were unnecessary, but according to the comments here, there are many people who seem to really love this, so I do not want to give anything away. In the end, I do not really care! There were not necessarily open plot holes; this looks like it could make a great book, in writing it's perfectly logical, but if I should believe that this is reality, something does not fit with the parts that were inserted at random. I often felt that crucial characters that we were never able to meet were played to further complicate the plot, increase the excitement and develop the mystery. the acting had no complaints about the direction, huh, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, SEVERELY lack. Sorry for those who felt this was a perfect suspense, but I could not get into it. I gave him a 3 simply because I did not want to sound completely unfair, and he had moments of little intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * MAJOR SPOILER * and I have to mention this .. but when dad is making his revelation to alexandre and JUST when you think the plot could not fit into another turnaround .. "his father didn do not die in a hunting accident ".. I almost died .. when was the father in all developed or even really mentioned much in the history back? !! are you serious!! as the already complex plot involving characters from all families and their relationship with each other was not enough !!? the protagonist NEEDS another emotional punishment than it has ever been fed! sorry, I had to play in a spoiler, but this only bothered me as much as I've ever been bothered in any movie.
