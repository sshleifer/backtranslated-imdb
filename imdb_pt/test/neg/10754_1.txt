I went to see this movie last night at the National Film Theater in London as a birthday present. It was the first time I saw it, and I think it now overcame the terrible "Twister" as the worst movie I've ever seen. Disarticulated by no reason, self-indulgent and full of images that ranges from gross and obvious to obscure and unintelligible, not particularly beautiful or gloomy, I really do not understand why this is considered classic, gay or otherwise. I usually like movies that push limits or even movies that are difficult to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. But that was truly, truly horrible.
