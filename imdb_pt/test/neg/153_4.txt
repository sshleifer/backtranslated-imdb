I suppose I can see why critics give this movie two or five stars, not fantastic, but I think it's worth a look, from director Shawn Levy (The Noise of Dozen, Night at the Museum). Basically, 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in the Middle of Frankie Muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will fail his whole semester and have which repeats the degree during the summer. So he completes his work, but getting a ride from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he manages to leave his paper with the "Big Fat Liar" story in the car. He discovers from a movie trailer that Marty stole his newspaper and is turning it into a great movie, so he and his best friend Kaylee (She's Amanda Bynes of Man) are on a mission to prove that Jason is telling the truth a turn. Marty, of course, is too nasty and presumptuous to make a phone call to Jason's father, Harry (Michael Bryan French), and he says he burns the role of "Big Fat Liar." So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as infernal as possible, until he agrees to call Jason's father. They put blue paint on their pool, and orange hair dye on their shampoo, and much more malicious jokes creating the chaos for Marty's career. There's the obvious point when Jason seems to want to give up, but do not worry, all the characters who despise Marty help in the final operation, and with Jason's parents coming, he wants to finally prove their truthfulness, and the boy delivers great style . Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and John Cho of American Pie as Dustin 'Dusty Wong. Muniz is friendly, Byrnes proves a surprisingly talented support and, despite wasting his time and talent a bit, Giamatti is great at being nasty. It's a children's movie, so if it looks corny, tacky or predictable, just keep that in mind and try to enjoy the performances and antics. OK!
