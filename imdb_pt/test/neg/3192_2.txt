Probably one of the worst movies ever made, I'm still trying to figure out if it was supposed to be fun, but I certainly did not enjoy it. Maybe the movie lost something during the English-Italian translation, I do not know, I sure miss the courage to watch it again in the original version. <br /> <br /> My rate for this is 2/10, and I feel like I'm very generous (let's say 1 point is for Liv because she's a good cat, and the other point is for those decent actors who got stuck in a useless, useless and pathetic movie) <br /> <br /> Careful Alex
