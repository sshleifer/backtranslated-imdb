I picked it up during a brief run in a theater in Philadelphia. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to the tragedy of a hometown, ie the death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to work hard on that film. The director, for better known reasons, decided to film the entire guerilla-style film, with non-stop handheld cameras and quick cuts. Such a technique may work for scenes of violent violence, but it is totally inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the bulk of the film. A walk on the sidewalk, a discussion of brother to brother on a couch, hell, even a kiss on a first date are all filmed cusinart style, distracting the viewer from entering the drama. Martin also reduces his narrative by putting on too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we have anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse ... have I missed something? No doubt a better cast (and a more focused direction) would have joined those wires together, as Martin certainly intended, to demonstrate how a moral failure leads and sustains a number of others ... but good intentions are not necessarily great to make movie. Just a sprawling mess. Martin, I know you're from my city, and I'm with you man, I really am ... just do a better job next time, like you did at Two Plus One.
