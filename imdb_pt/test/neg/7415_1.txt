I think this is one of my top ten movies I've seen! There is how to disappear every two minutes. If that were on TV, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But there is a visa that I personally liked: that is when the blonde is going to bathe in a boiling water pit with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body without towel! That was the best scene in the whole movie, because you see Sasquatch starring them, but the last 10 minutes is when we see your whole body. Also, most of the deaths are off the screen and just the scream or roar. And I was hoping Sasquatch would die. But it does not shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole movie. I was hoping that 8-10 people would die. Do not watch this movie. I give an F-. Do not waste your time.
