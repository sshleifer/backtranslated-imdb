This movie, despite its list of celebrities on the list B, C and D, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. The plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. It was so silly that I can not believe I'm taking the time to write a review. Flex, to his credit, has grown in his ability to perform since playing Michael Jackson in a TV movie made a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, regressed, since she was more talented in her role of felicity of Felicity a few years ago. As I watched this train movie, with its lamentable production and horrible sound quality, other four-letter words came to my mind to qualify what I thought of that film. However, in an effort to keep my G Rated writings, I'll simply say that this movie is another four letter word beginning with a LAME LAME !!!
