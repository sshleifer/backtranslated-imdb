SPOILERS, BE CAREFUL !!! Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. Some things confuse me (for example, Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to dance so well, Alex replies: "About 25 years," Alex should not be 18?) And some things fascinate me (I loved the rounds! ). Overall, though, that intrigued me. When this movie was made, I was not even born. I did not really try the eighties (I was born in 85) and I have to ask myself: sometimes Alex would run a little bit, or throw himself from one side to the other, not really dancing, just hitting things, throwing it head back, and waving his arms, was this considered "dancing" back then? If it was, I'm not sure I could handle it. The rounds, the movement, the fluid movements were great, but some of them - my neighbor's child could have done better! Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, would not she be tired after a hard day's work? When she will not be working for almost a week, will not she be fired? Living in a warehouse, I can almost see, but not quite. It does not seem right that she is a welder, owns a warehouse, and is trying to get into the ballet. None of this really makes sense. I should not be too critical considering my own past, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I do not know. But either way, they could have chosen a better actress. The actors were fine. I even liked the novel. You make your own decision. But mine is renting it once, I do not see it again - it's not worth it.
