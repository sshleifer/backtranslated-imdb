Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Long, confusing and little rewarding. After about three hours of this painful confusion, the end is truly the last nail in the coffin. Not even the magnificent, sexy and beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this poor adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The plot drags on and on and time passes slowly and suddenly you realize that you have no idea what is happening. Until the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, there is still much that is left unexplained and then ?? Ended. A complete waste of time and undoubtedly one of the worst adaptations to take the name of Agatha Christie.
