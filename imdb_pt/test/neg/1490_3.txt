I found an old VHS version of this movie at my parents' house so I thought I'd test it. From the beginning I was not expecting much from this movie and I'm happy about it because overall the movie was not good. <br /> <br /> The overall performance was pretty bad, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. A scene with a radio controller stands out as being so unfortunate that I found it hilarious that this scene was not cut. The first 30 minutes of the movie had almost no plot developed and I did not know what was going on. <br /> <br /> The story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was bad or was trying It's very difficult to put your own unique flair in the style of the movie. I got to watch the whole thing, but I'll probably never see this movie again.
