When I checked the movie review after watching it, I was surprised there were people giving good grades. <br /> <br /> This is a bad camera movie. Everything "scary" happens off-screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone yelling "Did you see / hear this?" Well, no, we did not see that! We can not! And when there were no close-ups, the camera was doing something weird like turning it upside down, or shaking it back and forth very, very quickly, both to convey action and to make us physically sick. <br /> <br /> The characters were unpleasant because every two minutes, they started yelling the same thing over and over again. I do not care if this is how 'really' it will be, I did not rent a horror movie to see things that were reasonable! I expect irrational things like aliens, demons or good acting! They were stupid too. Let's have intimate relationships in a cave! With all our clothes! Speaking of which, the end contradicts a little what Domingo said just before he died. It bothered me a bit, though not as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a ... serious invasion of a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> No plot, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera-work. What was left? Oh, right. The ending may have had a "twist," but usually with horror films, the turnaround at the end actually has a comprehensible relevance to what occurred during the film. The sixth sense explains a lot. Hide and Seek too. But the Cavern had a twist that served as an "explanation," if one can call it that, as it does not. Explain. Anything. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. Please.
