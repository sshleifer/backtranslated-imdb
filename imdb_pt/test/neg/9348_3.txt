Wow. The plot for this was incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie should be a comic genre. But even so, even the absurd must make at least some kind of vague sense. <br /> <br /> Has water become an incredibly rare substance? <br /> <br /> Well, this is strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most abundant substances in the universe. It's very easy to do. Glomp together hydrogen atoms and oxygen, and voil√†, water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or something like that should have been used as a plot device as something pirates would pursue. Water as a plot device was simply stupid, stupid, dumb. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" seemed worked, forged and forced. The comedy in the TV series "Red Dwarf" was worked out and planned and forced, but, in fact, it was fun. Here, instead, I felt like saying, "Ha ha, this was so funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> I sigh ... all this money put into sets, costumes, actors ... What a waste ... <br /> <br /> Instead of just whining and whining and complaining about your limping, my recommendations to make it better: 1) Use a plausible plot device. 2) Get rid of "comedy". Neither actor was really good at it. The movie would work best as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br /> The writers' obvious intention was to make a cheesy comedy, but they could not. I'm not likely to watch this again. It's quite a total hack job.
