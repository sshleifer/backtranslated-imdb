What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not so much. With the average production of indie films, this movie has all the time wrong. Editing is just awful. As far as the gangster story is concerned, it could have been ripped off if the gangsters had not lacked character. Everyone seemed to be there for some kind of joke. None of this was funny. The usual suspects in this movie are the prostitute with the heart of gold, the dying father of the Mafia who wants her son to do his legitimate business, the best friend of one-liners. But the main character, the gangster who likes to dress like a girl. Just your motivation to dress up as a girl is that he was robbed by a woman? Weird. The end of the film had to be the nail in the coffin. It was anti-climatic to say the least. I mean, I understand how indie filmmakers do not have the equipment for an appropriate shot, but they could also be using water guns. Overall, I would say the hype that preceded it (premiere red carpet in Vancouver), was a disappointment.
