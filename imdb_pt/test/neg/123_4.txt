First let me say: If you have not liked a Van Damme movie since the bloody sport, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best scenarios or best actors, but I like that kind of movie for who they are. This movie is so much better than any other movie that the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought of releasing in the last few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the film is only worth watching Van Damme fans. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I recommend for any one of Van Damme's tastes) or in hell, but in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same kind of feel as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!
