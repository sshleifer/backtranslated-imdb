I think I've finally seen the worst movie ever made, and it hurts me to say that. As a big independent movie fan, gay or not, I had high hopes. Several minutes into the movie, however, the sheriff appeared and got my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century. His performance and the dialogue he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the DVD on his track. Hours later, when I had the guts to push the play button again, it was no better. <br /> <br /> In addition to the sheriff and his racist counterparts, the film has a compelling cast for whom I felt genuine. sympathy since they had such a miserable script. The idea behind the film is good - using gay lynching in the "New South" just as it was used in black men in the Old South, leaving "strange fruits" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> With a talented writer and director, we could have had a movie. Instead we have false detective work, superficialities about homosexuality, and a clich√© with a good white man trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism still flourishes. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver at the back of Louisana who forced the black boys to reach the bottom of the bus. But this town is a cartoon, and it's hard to believe anything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are some subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three-dimensional, but for the most part, they too fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For the truly masochistic, the DVD contains some deleted scenes that will keep you running to hide. <br /> <br /> It's probably the first movie that makes me believe that the writer / directors should pass a test and be licensed before making a movie. Although I look forward to seeing several of the cast members in better movies, I would be hard pressed to witness anything else from this director.
