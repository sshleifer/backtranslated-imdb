Okay, I'll admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason why I went to see this movie. But it was so annoying that I almost slept. Sorry, but your acting talents are not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented as having excellent special effects and CGI. Yes, for a B-Movie it's not that bad. After having seen her in "Marquise" a few years ago (also a very bad movie), I thought she would play it more convincingly. But La Boum (and may be the James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movie with her. Is it your "talent", does she have a bad taste in choosing her movies or simply bad luck?
