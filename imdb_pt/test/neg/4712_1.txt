An annoying and untalented American documentary filmmaker learns a legendary South African monster, Half-Caste. Tradition says it is a half human creature, half leopard, with the closest parallel being the werewolf of the European tradition. Instead of focusing on the creature, the film follows the intricacies of the film crew. There is little action or suspense until the end of the movie. This problem is exacerbated by numerous annoying characters generating an incessant amount of even more irritating conversations. The basic premise is wasted since it is marginalized by the inexplicable focus on the documentary team. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Regardless, the movie fails at most levels. Avoid at all costs.
