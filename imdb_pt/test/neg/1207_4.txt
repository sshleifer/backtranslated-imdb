I rarely laughed so hard at a movie. Note that I laughed AT Iron Eagle, not with him, because this is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of sci-fi monstrosity CyberTracker). You must also remember that this movie is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> Even with a view to the absurd plot (the idea that a 16-year-old boy could enter a US Air Force base, steal an F-16, fly to the Middle East and kill about of a thousand people without anyone noticing that it is unbelievable), the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense. For example, at various points, Doug Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to fire a steel beam, a control tower, and a tent. All these things explode in a huge fireball. Because? The enemy aircraft also explodes in a strange way, remembering a paper plane being blown up with a firework. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I really liked this movie. Of course not in the way that the manufacturers probably wanted it to be appreciated, but even so I laughed and then bought the DVD. It is also enhanced by the impressive presence of David Suchet as the evil terrorist leader (perhaps you remember him as the Belgian detective Mustachioed Poirot?) Overall, then, the film is a laugh and a carefree alternative to a more serious fighter plane. movies like the Top Gun. Even if it's so subtly homo-erotic (check out the embrace between Doug and Chappy. Something is happening between them!)
