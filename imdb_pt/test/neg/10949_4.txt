The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District in Los Angeles getting ready for family reunion on Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and how to make an American quilt (I think there is a law that Alfre Woodard has to be in all these films) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a treat. Instead, I felt cheated. They display about 40 characters, and all but two are clich√©s of a note without any subtlety. Writers and the director should spend a few more years learning about life and learning how loving people from different generations actually relate. Instead, you have a lot of holes flocking on Turkey Day to act as an extra-nasty hole. Now, up to a point, that's what Thanksgiving is. But this is not mistaken. And why bother having Julianne Marguiles, so give her absolutely nothing to do. This was a difficult task, and Mercedes Ruehl is a highlight, but I give 4/10.
