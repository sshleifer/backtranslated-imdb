I am a big fan of horror movies, particularly from the 1980s subgenres. Name one ?? I've probably seen it. Last year, a new horror film that seemed to slip under the main radar called "Saw" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having heard nothing of it, I thought it seemed quite promising judging by the previews and posters (well, except the backs and the white ones with their hands and feet severed ... the ones that looked horrible!) I saw the movie on the night of opening. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This movie was literally mentally and psychically painful to watch. Why was it scary? ... NOT! Because it was one of the most horrible movies I've ever had the dislike to see! First of all, the construction of the script and editing was extremely atrocious, even by horror movie standards. Beginning a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived a serial killer attack, showing a flashback of what she survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any kind of tension, knowing that the victim mentioned above was perfectly fine. Of course, that shiver-bursting thing was scary ... but why should I feel a little scared when CLEARLY, you just showed me that she survived the ordeal? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built that way. It starts with two guys in a basement. So they show flashbacks of how they were kidnapped ... NOT SCARY! Because? Because we already know what will happen to them, seeing as we have just seen the result of the attack. THEY ARE WELL! Move on with the story! Even more unfortunately, the real story was sparse at best. I could not have cared less about these boring and unfortunate "character" excuses and the acting did not help. Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and all of a sudden, in the end, he started crying like a lost child as he struggled to keep his American accent in tact (it did not work - the audience I saw with it was in stitches). This led to a rash and stupid decision that even the simplest would not try. He had other options. Best. SMARTER. Even given his intense emotional state (horribly communicated through horrible acting), it was still irrational. I did not buy. BAD WRITING ALERT! Moreover, even when certain sequences were reproduced directly and without flashback, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found my foot beating impatiently waiting for the silent sequence to finish. This happened throughout the movie. I saw every "twist" coming. Twenty minutes after the movie, I had already called the killer's identity, not to mention his connection to his "accomplice (s)" as soon as they appeared on screen. Best acting may have been able to overshadow the horrible script. Instead, the actors could have tattooed "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" on their foreheads. At the end of the film, I was totally indignant to have wasted even a fragment of my life on this film, and the whole theater was laughing hysterically at the absolutely horrendous end. Seriously, you think they were watching a Monty Python movie. I'd have been laughing too if I had not been so annoyed by the total and utter failure of the movie to do ANYTHING that I set out to do. When we left, there was (no joke) a line to talk to the theater manager to get his money back (it did not happen). I was absolutely certain the movie would be a box-office bomb. The next week, you could not have imagined my shock to find that "Saw" had hit number one at the box office and EVERYONE was talking about it (most people thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was a thought-provoking epic and thought "satire "was some kind of rubber). I am so disgusted to hear people compliment this movie that I often feel like I will vomit. It is entertainment for the weak and simplistic of the human race. Those who find it strange that some Jigsaw clown clown on a tricycle threatening (it's a puppet? Tip it and get out? What's so scary about it?). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I own every "Friday the 13th", I love my splatter movies, I thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was hilarious, I did not get tired of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface, I enjoyed fonts of horror and I rated "Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers" among my top 10 favorite slashers. However, do I realize that these films are not the most sophisticated that American cinema has to offer? I thank you for what they are ?? Fun fast and easy. "Saw" is cinematic trash. The film tries to be a ride of intelligent and semi-sophisticated, unpleasant emotion, and bogged down in an irritating and irritating loss of time, money, energy and celluloid. Atrozes in all accounts. Each copy should be cremated, along with its faint-minded fans. Shame on you all. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Saw II"? Maybe after I take a double photo of Liquid Drano before tearing out my own eyes and impaling hot shish-kabob brochettes into my ears and colon. My Rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
