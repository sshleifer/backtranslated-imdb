This was a Hindi movie. Hindi = Horrible Reasons: Cheap Dialogs, Cheap Special Effects, Cheap Direction + Extending a 2 hour movie at most in 3 hours. <br /> <br />% spoiler ... little %%%%%%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Specifically for this movie: 1. dialogues are not funny. they are cheesy and cheap. Although akshay tried his best acting for what I admire, comedy was not funny at all! I only laughed 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the movie was useless for the story of the second half. the second half was the actual story / film. the first half was to pass / increase time. 3. Characters are not developed properly. paresh rawal is smart in the first half, an idiot in the second half / rest of the movie. we really do not develop any feeling or care for akshay and govinda. your characters are just stupid. they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. Jokes are funny, but they are not funny in a very serious scene. gang characters and drug smugglers are cheeky and have been used in the last 20 films. There is nothing new about these characters. Again, they are shown as asses for being funny. however, stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the movie. the only character that made sense was the lara dutta with a real story. 4. Special effects were crap. in the end, falls from the ladder of a fire truck. You realize they are not really on the ladder in the air. Second, people begin to fly when the ladder begins to move. ppl can not fly from a ladder when it is moving ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity. 5. The whole movie was dubbed. all dialogues were recorded after the movie. The lips of the actors hardly synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie sucked, but I can not remember them. look at this masterpiece of bad Indian movies by the unintelligent, even stupid director, and you will agree with my comment. people who enjoy Hindi movies, please raise your expectations of decent quality in Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all Hindu movies are bad. I like some. I did not like this one. <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the effort of akshay and lara)
