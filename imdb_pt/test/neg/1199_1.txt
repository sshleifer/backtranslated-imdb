Okay, the idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not have airplanes 2. Children do not fly with dirtbikes 3. This made the Air Force look like a total idiot 4. The boys' father would not risk his whole career to to allow his son to get involved with him. 5. Nor a colonel of the reserve. <br /> <br /> The sequences, I'm sure they were worse than this gut. The soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry, but I just do not understand why in the world someone would write straight and produce this garbage that is inaccessible. The Iranian Air Force is fortunate enough to get some parts for an aging F-14, and this kid does not have 1, but 2 F-16s fully loaded and loaded? Gimme a break.
