I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions, and I even liked the tension of Wade / Quinn in the early episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting scenarios for their stories. However, as the show continued, there were more silly disputes between friends and less of a real bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescending. And everyone had one of the characters falling in love. The writing got boring and everything was way above the top. Too bad it would be nice to have a group of friends (a la Star Wars) traveling to different dimensions on TV for several years, rather than a weary bunch of knit lanyards.
