I really should give this stink more credit than 1 star because the movie has so many lines rolling your eyes that it's almost worth the price of the rent. <br /> <br /> The acting, if you want to call it that, is so flamboyant and invented that it makes Ed Wood's actors look like life. "Sammy," the lonely black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in his other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are invaluable due to his absurd delivery, although I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old makes up in his other turkey ("pushed to the limit") is non-budget, quality collegiate with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray-painted hair. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone actually buying this video unless people like to launch their own Mystery Science Theater parties and need a copy of something like this at hand. It's really Beyond Fear - it's actually Beyond Funny.
