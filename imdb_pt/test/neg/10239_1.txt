I've seen several adaptations of Alice in Wonderland on stage and in the movies, and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD without thinking and could not even pass the first semester. Later I came back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a Christmas present for me) and I was shocked. The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show is Mark Lin-Baker playing Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent.) It's one of the few moments in the play that has some charm and can be taken a little seriously, and the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even Meryl Streep can not make that direction look good.
