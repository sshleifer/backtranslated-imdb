Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson perform well with Southern / New Orleans accents in this detective film. It's worth seeing their scenes and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors have fun to entertain us, no matter the movie, it seems. The plot for the movie shows potential, but you get the impression of watching the movie that did not go as well as it could have been. Being confused by a rather uninteresting subplot and hijackers, mostly uninteresting, really confuses things. The movie is worth it, if nothing more than entertaining presentations from Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
