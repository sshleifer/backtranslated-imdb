Despite the fact that this was a made-for-TV movie (and an obvious one in that: ie cheap-looking), CLASS WARFARE left me wishing I could have my money back, and considering that this thigh production was partially funded through Canadian dollars, I could just get right. <br /> <br /> What made me sit down at first was to see the actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I have seen in the last two years in her role of "goody-goody" Mara Lewis in the novel GUIDING LIGHT, taking the turn of interpret "bad girl" for a change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she does very well, as Kristen, a spoiled rich girl who suddenly finds herself wrong, but with a conniving tendency, and a twist of fate, that possibly will change her luck. back. The twist of fate is provided in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially radical outcast who discovers he has nothing to win $ 23 million in a lottery ticket. Now put Richard, Kristen, her boyfriend Jock (Wade Carpenter), and mutual friend Graham (Dave McGowan) obsessed by the camcorder together for the weekend in a remote cabin, isolated from the world by storms, and just guess what unfolds. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the congestion of both the story and the personas and motives of the characters. Everyone is very one-dimensional and you do not have to be a rocket scientist to find out that some things, and some people, go very badly, very quickly. I do not think this is an original storyline and it does not go out of your way to do anything else. The acting is good, McKeon is the female manipulator leader, and Dunne is very good, sometimes a little too good, but no one is worth writing about. The only other real credit I can give to the movie is the one thing I did not see coming to an end (it's not the end though, it's so obvious it hurts). Regardless, I sat through all this and lived to tell the story, so I can not say it was a complete cancellation. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A "something to watch when nothing is" movie.
