Now I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also like hygienic humor <br /> <br /> Like Young Ones and Bottom etc. <br /> <br /> This however failed to bring even a small smile <br /> < my face. The story follows Johnny after his wife expels him (as he got his good wife and son I do not know) as he tries to fuck anything that moves. Failing normally. I was looking forward to this, but found it was totally annoying and a waste of my time altogether. Unless you're stuck for something to do for 90 minutes plus wash the car, then do not bother ..... <br /> <br />
