"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the continuation, although you do not really need to see the first "House of the Dead" to make this movie. That said, the production value is definitely here with great zombie effects and is edited very well with a very effective sound design. However, that being said, it is about all that is good here. <br /> <br /> The story and the script are terrible. . . There are glaring holes everywhere. It's also funny how soldiers do not care if they get blood on their faces (unlike 28 Days Later, where blood on any part of the body will infect you). It is also realistic as there is little order with the soldiers here, unlike the usual US military discipline. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10.
