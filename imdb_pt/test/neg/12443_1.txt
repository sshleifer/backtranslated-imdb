My mom brought me this movie on a DVD. A guy in a rental recommended. But in fact, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I did not expect much from this movie, but it did not have a good story, nor was it funny and it was pointless. I was looking forward to seeing Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved it step by step. Even she was a big disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the party guys is dead (he was not actually dead, he woke up later), the house looks like it blew up a bomb and there are two guys who have 3 hours to deal with everything. But here comes a homosexual, cop ... There is a total mess to the end and the guys got tide and everything in about 15 minutes ??? Come on, just be realistic, at least. Waste of money. Same...
