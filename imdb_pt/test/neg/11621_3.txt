I really enjoyed the BG Seasons 1-3 and really could not understand who did not like it. But I can not defend this absurdity. Here are the spoilers. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things regularly. So if Starbuck thinks he knows where the Earth is, why not send it? in a raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the Quorum elect its new member, the unelected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience and is the son of a man he suspects. Would Adama send Gaeta and Halo along with Starbuck, leaving him without senior officers? Would Adama make a man have sex with Cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I just do not buy any of it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, as long as I accept, it was miracles and references to God until the end of Season 3, now it's all over the top. I started watching BG because I thought it was science fiction, not some biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently, and I wanted some good explanations for some of the strangest developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character in the series, but now he seems totally insane. It is not illogical, considering what he has gone through, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to be just puppets dancing at the request of others (some divine entity). This is not a good drama, it's annoying and it's a cop. <br /> <br /> OK, so what are the good points? Beautiful battle at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well represented) when viewed in isolation. A good final scene, a beautiful curve curve of development. <br /> <br /> But this is not Sci Fi, turned Fantasy. I can not imagine how writers can retrieve this.
