A single mother, her son and daughter and her hippie puppy friend are camped in the woods. A muscle tied, machete wielding maniac in a yellow ski mask appears. He begins to terrorize and sexually rape the family before murdering them with a machete . Wilderness "is loaded with ugly hardcore sex, forced incest and flagrant racism.It is politically incorrect as XXX roughies get.A score is stolen from Hitchcock's seminal classic horror" Psycho "and also" Jaws ".The acting is hilariously terrible, editing it is bad and there are some huge lapses in logic.The repetitive nature of the sex scenes crunches the movie after a while, so the brief run time is a blessing.The scenes of violence are quite unpleasant, for example, the hippie girl is stabbed with the machete in his groin and one can see the blood in his groin.3 of 10 and this is generous.
