I tried. Lord help me, as I have tried. But there are only a few people almost incapable of creating quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To his credit, "The September 11 Commission Report" looks like an honest attempt by the company to move to a more sophisticated state of narrative and film production. But for all intents and purposes, it's another true movie in his gallery. At the opening, the notice notifies the public that all names have changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Mussaui tries to learn how to fly a plane. With a grimace of cold stone that would instantly make anyone uncomfortable, this "disguised" agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer. And you have to ask yourself, not how he got into that program so easily, but how these people did not even ask questions; because this scene is so absurd in its presentation, and the actor who plays this guy is extremely exaggerated. And you can see that director Scott tries to imitate Paul Greengrass with a brilliant grainy photograph that is followed by a very stunning and annoying hand direction that, throughout the film, tries to take off from Greengrass guerrilla film techniques. . <br /> <br /> You may feel Scott imitating the Greengrass technique for realism, but it becomes half inefficient halfway. Meanwhile, the film comes out less with a "Traffic", and another takeoff in "Law & Order" where we will have the notice notifying us the names have changed, the logo almost resembles the "Law & Order" logo and then , ninety minutes of actors pumping their breasts and discussing politics. <br /> None of which is as attractive as it tries to be. And then, when the movie seems to be trying to be an adult drama, Scott trusts his old security spot, the sex scene. Scott's new film looks like it really does want to be thought of as a low-budget "Munich", but it's not, and it succeeds in being nothing astounding on every possible occasion. "The 9/11 Commission Report" is unclear, and this is because it is limited in its attempts to imitate other films. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate the inherent ambition behind the camera, this new perspective on the events leading up to 9/11 is flat and lackluster. As difficult as it is to try to be a "budget" Munich, it's just as much fun as a normal Dolph Lundgren movie you'd find on Cinemax.
