Wow. Just Wow. Never before have I seen a horror movie in what looked like a poor self-insertion fanfic that someone wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then I happened to find "Lady Frankenstein". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it completely upside down ... and not in a good way. If you watched this movie, or saw the version dubbed in the 50 Chilling Classics Box as the number 24. And let's just say that there is a reason why these movies are here. Because they are not very good. enough of that, in the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with Dr. Frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant, which is ... obviously not for some reason. Your graduate daughter (?) Appears and declares how she just graduated with a medical degree, because yes. There were so many doctors back then. So she states how she wants to help her father with his job and he says no. And then he does the monster and it kills him. Then she suffers for exactly 7 seconds and then invents a story with the assistant as was a thief. The monster escapes and goes into fury. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can not believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the movie. He dies like ... 20 minutes later, and then his daughter takes over. which ... does not make much sense, but of course. <br /> <br /> So, Lady Frankenstein decides that the best way to kill the monster that is now furious ... is to make another monster! oh yeah how I love your logic. So her new monster, she gets the body, killing someone and putting the wizard's brain in it ... I know. Just nod and move on. Then the monsters meet and fight. I love how the wizard asks "why do not we let the monsters kill him?" and she responds with "They would not know how to kill you!" and in the end he kills with an ax in the head. haha oh yeah, no one else could have realized that. Then in the end, the brain changed again monster kills lady frankenstein. The End. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. was seriously as someone wrote a self insertion fanfic. There's no other way to describe this movie. there were some strange and bare scenes as well. Like, this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster catches the girl and the guy goes away. haha cool guy She then tries a little and dies from ..... to be honest, I really do not know what she died. But anyway. It's Lady Frankenstein. It does not have to make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie had many of these "Why?" moments to the point of giving up. Movies should not do that, but for some reason I see it more than I probably should. <br /> <br /> So, final word, it's not the worst movie I've seen in this package, but it's a bit boring and full of many holes and random stuff. <br /> <br /> So, Lady Frankenstein gets 3 Porn scenes of Frankenstein, 10
