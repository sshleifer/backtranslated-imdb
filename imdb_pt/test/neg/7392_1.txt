I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which can influence my opinion on this. I've seen all the Dogme movies, and this TKIA, is by far the worst. The story intertwines with themes from Shakespeare's play: King Lear, but can never capture the audience and make them care. The direction of the actors is very loose, even for films in the Dogme style, and results in an indefinable performance. The story has no momentum, and I've lost interest very soon. There are some scenes in the movie that are there to shock the viewer, but I do not think they have improved the story. Mifunes sidste sang and Festen are both Dogmefilms that have proven to be well-directed, and had good stories, so I look forward to improving the Dogmefilms in the future. Maybe "An Invisible Man-Dogme 6", by Aake Sandgren, will improve the quality. For he is like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is a qualified and educated director.
