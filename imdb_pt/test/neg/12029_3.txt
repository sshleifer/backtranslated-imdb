Detective Burt Williams is on the trail of Poe's infamous killer almost three years ago. Burt's daughter, Kris Williams, the FBI's homicide agent, along with her partner Sean Michaels, takes office. Burt reluctantly walks away from the case and retires. Over the next seven months the "Poe Killer" continues its murderous fury until Kris finds out that the killer uses chat rooms on the internet to seduce her prey. She enters as Annabel Lee and is quickly captured by Poe's killer. It's time to find the sadist and free your daughter before it's too late. A Mauritanian horror film and supremely indecisive, without suspense and a little nasty. The acting is hilariously terrible, the characters are painfully mute and the killer is not menacing. I still watch indie horror movies worse. 3 out of 10.
