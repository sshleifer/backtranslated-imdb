First of all, I just want to say that I'm a big fan of Naruto. I love anime and manga stories. In addition, the first film just confirmed that Naruto is all very fun, great action, great story, ... But then came the second film. I was really excited because the first movie was great. But that did not please me at all ... The story was lame, the action was not so good ... especially in comparison to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of the animation. I found it very wrong ... Could the story have any lick ... ANY ??? Where is Naruto's kyuubi? Not once had he seen a demon ... I mean ... COME !!! My advice is ... see the series (until episode 140, so it's just fillers) and then read the manga because that's still great. Ignore this movie and wait for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone I gave a 4, just because it is Naruto ...
