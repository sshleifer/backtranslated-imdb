This movie has to stay in the history of bad movies as the worst I have ever seen. It was not even a bad movie ... I would have rated it as a z. The special effects were ridiculous ... if you could call them special effects. I think the reviewer before hit the head ... was the box that sold the film, while the cover art was great and the intriguing synopsis (which is why I rented it) was a waste of not only time but money also. I did not last long. I took it back to the store and moved to another movie that I believe my local video store took off the shelf because they had SOOOO many complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old could have done a better job filming him / writing the script!
