I was a little old for this show that I was 6 when it first came out. First off when I was a small child there were some children shows that were on the sesame street that I watched and learned from, but other than that there was not much else. My cousins ​​were born a few years after me, 7 years was the first to appear later. Barney was a very important part of what they watched. When I first saw this show, I told my grandmother that he teaches nothing, just uses magic to fix everything. I was 9 years old at the time, how many 9 year olds have any idea of ​​what's really going on with a TV show. More and more that I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were more and more I told people how bad the show was. Funny is my parents who had a child in the mid 80's that I was by the way. They agreed and said the same thing I did. The sad thing about this is my cousins ​​who are now 13 and this still agrees with what they saw. It is not deceiving your creativity, it is not right to think differently than someone tells you. Its ok to steal if the person will not find out or cares that it is gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney wants to make money and not teach kids anything. The more flashy the program, the more inclined will the children watch it. Children are stupid not because they are not educated, they just do not know anything better, according to Barney made a show and parents bought. I never believed TV could affect people the way Barney does. If you have a small child, read to them to watch a program that teaches them numbers, do not let them get involved in that program. Barney is like smoking once is too much, smoke a little and your addict let your child watch this show they are addicted and one day your kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought
