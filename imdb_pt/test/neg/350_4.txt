That's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishmen. The shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and the crew landed on the island, or they were caught by fishermen or tied to work on the treasure hunt, the lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, has kept the disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years, so the fishmongers can discover a treasure under the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete madman. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This insanity was directed by Sergio Martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. It is fast, reasonably well represented, and the fishmen seem quite convincing (though it is unlikely anyone can prove that these things do not look like real fishmongers). There is an excellent soundtrack by Luciano Michelini.
