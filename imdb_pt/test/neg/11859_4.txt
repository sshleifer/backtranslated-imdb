I go in this game and it's okay, I guess. I just expected a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions that you can not. Also, the graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and the Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if the guards are in the water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry, but nothing happens. In my opinion, this is the worst of the three. I did not play the first one, but I played Pandora Tomorrow, this one and Double agent. This game deserves a 4/10 though. Could do with some improvements.
