The first movie was pretty hip and had fun times, this movie does not have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to keep his barber shop running, but this is not only against designer Gina (Queen Latifah) with a beauty salon next door, but soon a large chain of barbershops called Nappy Cutz opens on the other side from street. Calvin, along with co-workers and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eva) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), are doing everything they can to keep regular customers coming and , finally, your business running against the competition. Also starring Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Bad Company Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Loretta. I did not like this movie as much as the first one because of the unnecessary flashbacks about Eddie, and it's not so witty, I got tired of it. OK!
