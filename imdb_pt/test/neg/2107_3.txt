To his credit, this is one of his most competent pieces of junk, and that's because there's so much good blood, and an interesting take on ripping "Snakes on a Plane." But if there are more examples of the inconsistency behind the latest Asylum assault, it's the two characters at the outset who are illegal immigrants and can not understand or speak English to a Texan who cheats them across the border, but when they arrive in a train and meet a friend, they begin to understand and speak perfect English. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a lousy representation of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a Train" is completely boring. At least with "Snakes on a Plane" we were given the chance to watch the comedy of comedic actors and try to be remotely interesting. The Mallachi Brothers part features some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (hey, I wonder how it comes in handy later) to some skinny surfers, even our two main characters trying to fight out of the curse of the snake that hides in the husband's wife. <br /> <br /> "Snakes" is never fun, and even when it's very bloody, it's never as good as it gets, because "Snakes" could have been a funny short film, and instead , takes himself very seriously, and never camping it at any time. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent, they force their small budget to work against them in those starts. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train looks incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It looks almost like a play with those fickle and terribly dull parts that desperately try to look like real train cars, while every now and then it shakes, the bottoms of the windows blur, and the effects sound from time to time to inform us that they are actually on a train; not to mention that in such a large and extensive train there seem to be only about ten passengers. And in addition to the train fight and an extended sex scene, we are forced to submit to a plot that does not make sense. And not even the directors can circumvent the fact that the "lethal" snakes that go on this train seem far from poisonous or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film comes in just a minute of snake carnage. and a bad subplot of a former drug agent trying to harass a passenger. All this dull exposure ends with a really ridiculous climax, in which a computer-generated snake (I saw a better animation on Super Nintendo) completely swallows the train and is then dispensed with a method that should have been exercised from the beginning. . Asylum scores again. <br /> <br /> The asylum punctuates once again with a ripped, lazy, horribly driven and boring of another better movie. "Snakes on a Train" takes it too seriously, and that's why it's never fun or memorable.
