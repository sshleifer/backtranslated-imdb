This film was produced by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Although its authors boast as Costa Rica's biggest film ever made and its actors dare say they did not get an Oscar nomination because of their political relevance to oil (he, alright) ... Well, that's all lies. This film was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera on a love triangle (supercliché novella subject) and its secondary story is about an oil problem on Costa Rica's Atlantic Coast with an American oil company that wanted to explore oil deposits in the region, but in the end was never approved by the government. Now, there may be some cool scenes on the beaches, but that's all; nothing bigger than that ... it's all in the camera. Most of the actors are terrible except for two or three. The rest have no notion of what it means to act: they exaggerate most of the time. The story is completely ordinary and cliché, worthy of a cheap Mexican novel like I said .. because the team has published as a protest movie about oil, but 80% of the film is based on a stupid love triangle. The script does not impress, it's very simple and the dialogues are not very thought-provoking. It also has some editing problem in some scene changes ... but beyond that it's pretty decent. The director did a good job, I mean, he's not like an Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources he had at hand. I would like to question him because, instead of using the Costarican actor, he spent most of the money on foreigners. I mean, after all, they bragged about being a 100% Costarican production ... that's what you at least expect. Final the end is not well done, there are flaws and details that do not match or are useless. Besides being the most elaborate film in all of Costa Rica's history, I think it is mediocre. You can make more interesting and better photos with less money. Never heard of "Pi"? Anyway, if you are curious about movies from Costa Rica or Central America, this will do, but you are definitely not missing out on anything.
