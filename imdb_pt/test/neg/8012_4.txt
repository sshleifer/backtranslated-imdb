I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this movie made me cold. I was expecting another American in Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I was expecting a lot. <br /> <br /> The film was short on songs and lacking in impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by Kelly's very expressionistic dance as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed with the Nicholas brothers in Be a Clown, sorry that the music was so annoying. I also liked Judy attacking Kelly with bric-a-brac. See Lorna Luft's autobiography for interesting information about the scene. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film has what should be one of Cole Porter's most annoying songs, especially "Nina." Besides, Judy and Gene constantly yell like strident children. <br /> <br /> The plot is fine - which is par for the music course - but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor. Please, some movie restorer, find those pieces of film and show us what the movie could have been!
