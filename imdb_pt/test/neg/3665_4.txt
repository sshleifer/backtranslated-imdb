8 days without a script is what the DVD tells you is how the movie was made. It is shot in unfocused video which is occasionally used for a good effect, but it is actually partially naked women sitting around a room for most of the runtime. It is very well represented and it helps a lot. But the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls / women sit and moan they do not try to escape or do something very interesting, so the whole thing grinds to a halt after about 20 minutes. It would have been a good short maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. Because? Because they had no script. How many movies were made without scripts. Not much. I wonder why this is? How many great movies were made from bad scripts. Not much. Why is that? Working against this great problem, the management tries and does some interesting things, but with what is essentially nothing. The topless girls, filmed in a colorless and grainy dark video, stand for a while, but not for the short but long duration of the feature. Actors again deserve praise if only there was a script. <br /> <br /> Also the quality of the video, or the lack of it, is really low, they try to use this to advantage and sometimes some photos look like Miami Vice, the recent movie that is. But this is not meant to praise Miami Vice or this failed venture.
