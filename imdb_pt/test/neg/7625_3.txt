weird.this is a TV movie, but the rating on the box says it is rated R. There is nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for a R rating. Also, the movie is very slow and meaningless. The idea was good, but nothing was done with the plot. It was not developed. It's a little scary, and the acting is really very good, better than the movie deserves. I do not see myself watching again so early if there have always been other movies dealing with the same concept that are better done than this. I have not seen many Wes Craven Films, so I can not really compare it to any of their others. As for this movie itself. though, I think it's poorly designed and poorly executed. For me, I can not give Chiller a rating higher than 3/10
