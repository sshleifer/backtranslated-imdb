Three young university students, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic) embark on an adventure traversing the Kolpa River, dividing their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia in this 2002 Slovenian film by Maya Weiss. What might have been an Eastern European version of the well-known and exciting "Deliverance" of 1972 turned out to be quite uninteresting to me with portraits of flat characters denying the solidary identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and Zana are not at all convincing as students, although Alja expressed the desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language. Alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to be just drifting in life. Zana, even less erudite, is an adventure enthusiast who cares about other women. I had some sympathy for the relatively innocent, conservative and starry Simona. The idea of ​​these three traveling together does not work for me. The disdain that Zana and Alja demonstrate about Simona does not make sense - why would they choose her as a travel companion to begin with, as surely they should know her behavior and attitudes? The three begin a carefree journey the river in two canoes, not discouraged with a news about the disappearance of a woman along the river. Things become more somber with the mysterious, sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory appearance of a radically conservative fisherman politician (Jonas Znidarsic). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the scenes along the river and small villages to visit the trio. It may be because of a lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not move me any other way. I was surprised to see that the movie won a few awards.
