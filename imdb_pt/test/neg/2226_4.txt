The social responsibility of Warner Brothers is very contained, with sermons every five minutes about how we are Americans, we do not run away from problems, we face our responsibilities. It also suggests that if you are willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly mortal thugs, you are anti-American. Walter Huston, seemingly bored, is the frustrated DA, and the "common American family" includes familiar faces like Sally Blane (looking a lot like her sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, like a supposedly lovable girl. Both are regularly crowded out of the frame by Chic Sale, only 47 then playing a veteran octogenarian of the Civil War, jumping heavily and "playfully" pinching Hooch's ban and moralizing on how American we are, dag nabbit. Your St. Vitus Dance rogue performance is tiring; It's as if Walter Brennan had based his entire career on it. William Wellman drives efficiently and quickly, much like his previous Public Enemy, but he and the writer do not show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout - that is, they would probably be wiped out by the crowd.
