Kate is a tired young woman who has problems meeting and dating men. Throughout the movie, you meet several of your loser boyfriends. And throughout the movie, you are subject to Kate's cynical negative view of love and relationships. This negative viewpoint is continued and presented as Supreme Truth. I had a real problem with that. Why would anyone want to be taught about love, life, and dating someone who is obviously so confused? It would work if that were the joke, but it is not. For the movie jokes (which are not funny or original) to work, you have to believe what Kate is saying: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad sex or no sex, that the highest level a relationship can evolve is When you are able to fart in front of your partner ... You get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no recent memory film that comes close to disrupting the stomach as much as Love & Sex. Why did the filmmakers waste their time on such junk? Every joke on Love & Sex is something I've experienced in another movie or in my own life. There is NOTHING original or creative about history, production or style. It's cynical, dumb and meaningless. Mind numbing!
