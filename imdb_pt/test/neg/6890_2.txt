Skeletons In The Closet takes the parent-adolescent child genre to new low levels. This is a movie that is no good. The plot is presented in the first few minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are clich√© and despite the twists that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything unfolds exactly as you think. In the middle of the movie I could not take the rhythm of the snail anymore and started to move forward quickly. The film ended exactly as I had hoped. Linda Hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction. If you truly believe you need to see this uninspired and uninspired whodunit, watch it quickly.
