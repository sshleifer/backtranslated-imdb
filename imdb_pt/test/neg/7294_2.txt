I will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all the characters are transformed into something they were never, and should never be, animation that was demoted to the bare minimum, and finally why did someone who did wonderful narration work for Obi? -Wan Kenobi in "Clone Wars" want to copy Michael J. Fox? I happen to have an answer for that. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately, it's true. <br /> <br />.
