Young writers, young author, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? All. Even lame is a very good description, which suggests that three of the four legs were working, when in fact none of them were. Just enough recycled plot for a 48-minute television hour, gradually extended to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence cabinet. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops make good cops. Again, how many times? There was no original fragment throughout this invention. Giovanni Ribisi made a valiant effort to sustain the lack of script, drawing the only laughter from the entire film. And the thought of him and Claire Danes working on a real screenplay with an adult director and photographed by a real director of photography intrigues me. Note to writers: Buy one of these story-makers. It can not be as bad as pulling out bad television. Note to the author: There are shots available for you in addition to closes. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes ends up getting tiresome in close-up. Note to the director of photography: Learn a professional for a few years - you have a lot to learn. Note coloring timer in the lab: at least try to convince the author and the filmmaker that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this has paid for your new condo. It's time to get some professional management and start reading the scripts before entering.
