This is the first movie I watched from Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani, also known as Miles Deem. The above title was added superfluously later, as there is another 1961 film, also titled, starring Richard Basehart, which was the only Michael Carreras hit by Hammer Films in the Western; the genuinely Italian title was originally translated as HIS NAME WAS SAM WALBASH, BUT THEY CALLED IT, although in fact it was WALACH in the Italian variant which, of course, implies a tribute to Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> Although certainly not terribly bad, there are cases of ineptitude and ineptitude, so that I was often bursting with laughter: a horrible number of a pretentious irresistible French singer; a totally irrelevant bar fight; actors doing somersaults while being shot; an elderly villager doing an improvised dance routine; ineffective (actually, abuse) slow-motion use; and, most easily absurdly, see Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two gunslingers hired by the villain to kill the title character and never have them appear in the rest of the movie! ! <br /> <br /> The lead actor, Robert Woods, is exactly the same as inefficiently whispering the Amens over the bodies of their victims. Supporting the actress Simonella Vitelli (actually the director's own daughter!) As the villain is pretty good, but unfortunately she can not do much in the film? despite having a change of heart in the end. The main theme song is actually quite good, but again, the title song itself is pretty bad.
