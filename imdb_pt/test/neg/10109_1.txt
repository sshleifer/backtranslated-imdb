Well, I'll start with this: I love horror movies, not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. Second; this is the worst movie of all time. He even kills Medium Weapons and the attack of murderous tomatoes. And that's why I pay tribute. <br /> <br /> However, the involuntary humor was only funny until half of the movie had passed, after which everything was so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews were a bit split; and you who have classified this piece of film C from 7 upwards; I know you're joking! A GOOD!! HAHA HA! Because if there is any reason in the world, and we have only a little bit of the same notion of quality; you can not be real. <br /> <br /> Everything worth being mentioned about the content has already been very well raised, so I'll leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where the hooded rubber mask drags the woman from side to side in the kennel for ten minutes, with a soundtrack so terrible and the mind-blowing dialogue between the two, really does it for me.
