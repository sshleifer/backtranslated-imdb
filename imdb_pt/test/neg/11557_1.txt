I think I can safely say (without actually giving anything) that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in "robot" fantasies have not acted or talked like that, and the evil entity behind the whole "plot" is not a robot, either. <br /> <br /> The whole thing seems to have been filmed in a city park somewhere, with photos fallen in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can not even use words to describe the acting ... <br /> <br /> That could not even offer the hilarious ending of "Star Crystal". In short, it's clearly one of the worst science fiction films of the '80s and I would be so bold as to say "all-time."
