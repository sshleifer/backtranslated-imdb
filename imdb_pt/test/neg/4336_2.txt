Talk about a snore. This third-rate motorcycle movie was putting me to sleep once the initial credits appeared on the screen. The shame is that the cast included many fine actors, among them George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. <br /> <br /> A Takeoff of the Western Classic, High Noon This is basically the story of a former US Army Green Beret (Henriksen) trying to get someone to help him rid a town of a horse from a gang of scary motorcyclists. <br /> <br /> Everyone tries, but the script is at the elementary level. It's sad to see the Academy Award winner Kennedy in such a comedian of his outstanding performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have trouble sleeping at night, this would be a perfect video to rent .......... you will be sleeping in no time!
