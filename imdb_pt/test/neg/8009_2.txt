they (dueringer, dorfer) are good comedians, young people, they are not ugly, they have money, the girls love them, the audience is enjoying everything they are doing <br /> <br /> and then they made this movie ... <br /> <br /> No story, some jokes were old in the fifties, the acting is horrible. Save your money for something useful, as a gift for your girlfriend.
