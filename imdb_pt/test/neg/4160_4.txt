*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I saw this movie last night at a screening. I started liking Tim Robbins and loving science fiction. The first third of the movie was really cool. The score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the vision of the filmmaker's future was realistic, yet completely interesting. I remember thinking to myself, "This is the most intelligent science fiction movie I've seen in a while." So they just could not keep together. <br /> <br /> Although, from the beginning, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" issues with this film (namely the editing, and later some of the written compositions). / plot development), these issues were forgivable. They became unforgivable once the movie lost its momentum halfway, and then the movie got boring when you realized you were not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robbins could not bring his character to life, but he did the best he could. Her female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the film's intricacies seemed to be that filmmakers could not decide whether or not they wanted to make a science fiction. -fi movie or a futuristic love story. They ended up with none. <br /> <br /> Good: Part of the cinematography: grainy, looked like "21 days later" a few times. <br /> <br /> Very suitable for a futuristic movie like this. <br /> <br /> I dug some of the locations. <br /> <br /> The music was cool. <br /> <br /> The vision of the filmmakers of the future was realistic, but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with the other secondary characters of the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the texts were interesting (right at the beginning). . <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (name does not remember), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> A few questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story. That is, VIRUS. Obviously, the virus they gave her at the end of the movie that physically left her "scared" of him was there just so they could stay in another sex scene and then she could wildly denounce him by Code 46. So they took him and erase your memory and the movie ends. Classic dream sequence if you ask me. tie all loose ends very well if you just make it all a dream right? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus? <br /> <br /> Why not? Do they exploit the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of her mother? That could have made an interesting story. <br /> <br /> At first I like everyone's greetings in everyone's speech. But it became intrusive, especially since his accents were not convincing. I understand, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it began to feel like a AT & T Global Networking commercial at the end of it. <br /> <br /> If they were 'outside', how could they have achieved it? arrested by Code 46? <br /> <br /> 'Cover' has never been well defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and sometimes it was as vital as life or death. Once again, loose definitions allow them to use it to join different parts of the frame. <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm starting to get negative about this, so I'll stop. There were some cool scenes and interesting things about this movie, but this only gives a 4/10 rating.
