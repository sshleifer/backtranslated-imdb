Let's get right to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the main actors seem to have been forced to participate. History asks us to believe that there is a clandestine lesbian sex cult, in which members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson, whose work seems to be the recruiter of the cult. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad pornography and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, poor Ellen seems to be in pain. Barkin's talent is totally wasted on this piece of garbage sexploitation B-grade garbage and hopefully she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this movie.
