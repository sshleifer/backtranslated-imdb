I do not see what the whole deal is about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the movie charming, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want to get all the benefits of this, buy the Patricia CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if you omit the "dreams"); the main characters seem to love each other instantly, and also instantly forget their other acquaintances. Relationships seem almost "mandatory," and the small "detective story" just makes things worse. What at first seemed like a perfect ending to the movie, was first spoiled and then came out as just a dream. I measure movies for how well I would remember them, and for this, I've already begun to forget the details.
