The film itself is just a compilation of scenes that have no inherent meaning for someone living outside of Russia. I will not deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it has no interest for the intellectual or ordinary man. We are just observing an organized form of photos, ranging from a man with an arm hitting a horse to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is awkward, random and completely unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum that kept the viewer interested, but that would not be the case, although the director's method is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> On the whole, one should see this if they are an art. student, on hallucinogenic drugs, or a pre-Tarkovskian film student.
