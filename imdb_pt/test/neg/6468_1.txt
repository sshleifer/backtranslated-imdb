I'm really at a loss as someone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). It is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad antics, etc. I never thought I could see a performance worse than the purposely misinterpreted scenes at the beginning of UHF, but that was it. And when you think it can not get worse, it happens! Again and again! Could you really have seen it in a theater? Not worth it on TV! My four year old and a one year old liked it but wanted to see more the cat and the cat almost never was.
