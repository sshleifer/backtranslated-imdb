This movie has not done that for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. The portrait of Jamie Gertz was OK, but there was something so discouraging about the movie itself. The facts presented in the film are totally distorted. But Merv Griffin produced, so that would explain a lot. He's never been to SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was in SNL are back. When we see her for the first time in the SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is around 1988-1989, not 1975. And let's talk about the cast - who are these people? I've never heard of one of them. Truly unsatisfactory. This movie shows why TV movies are just that, TV movies.
