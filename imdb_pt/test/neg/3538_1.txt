The only reason I saw this movie was because it had Giovanni Ribisi and it should be "Horror". Do not be fooled, this movie has to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. It's about these people who go to a secret location that has a "monster". The monster is a man with a deformed face running out of blue pants that has a craving for brains. Some people die, others do not. In the end, they throw the monster out of an airplane and then fly away happily. BUT NOT! MONSTER STILL IS ALIVE AFTER CUTTING A PLAN! It will spend 2 hours in some other way, like watching paint dry on a wall, trust me, it's more fun than that crap.
