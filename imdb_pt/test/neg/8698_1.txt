This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time .. in the first 10 minutes I was already annoyed as I am familiar with the actual version of the story according to the Torah (5 books of Moses) ... but I decided to watch it to get the value of my money and also see how bad it sucked. Well, it sucked .. more then I thought it would. First and for most let's start with the script and the skeleton characters that make up the body of a movie. If you study the Torah, you will see that the story is all wrong, are some of the distant errors: Moses does not do slave labor because he was in the tribe of Levi, Moses does not kill anyone on Mount Sinai. But still the movie shows Moses being whipped and Aaron and himself killing people ... reeeealllly not! When Moses speaks to the burning bush, he knows who is speaking as well, but the film makes Moses look like an idiot, he claims that he does not know who Gd is in the bush. his distance growing, Aaron was known for his peaceful, calm and composed nature, but still he is described as angry and arrogant in this film. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie .. how ridiculous .... Pharaoh the real was really and ugly dwarf who sat on top of a pyramid of stairs so he could look bigger then he went and Moses was over 10 feet and in the movie Pharaoh is taller than him and he is warm with light eyes! The wife of Am Israel (the nation of Israel) covered herself by signifying her hair and bodies and they did not dance or sing in front of men, they did not participate in the golden calf so they definitely would not dance with a man in public as the film portrays . The wife of Moses, Tzipora, was married to Moses and therefore covered herself and, being as humble as they, did not embrace or held hands in public. The daughter of Batia Pharoah (the one who adopted him and saved her from the water) was converted to Judaism and therefore would have taken pride in Moses when he said that he would free his people. The fast fast to mount the Sinai Moses descends the second. time with two sets of tablets ... with scribbles writing about it .. at least put the writing in the sacred language, Hebrew or English and put it in a tablet not two sets .. Bottom line is the film is terribly written, directed and the characters are all wrong.Basically EVERYTHING is wrong about the movie ... The old one is inaccurate too, but it's more realistic, and the actors are believable. I'm Israel Chai!
