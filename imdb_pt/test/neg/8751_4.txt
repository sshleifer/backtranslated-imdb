While guiding the water, a young psychic named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) comes across something completely different. She discovers a chest buried for centuries at her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure that his aunt hopes for, the chest holds the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Controlling telepathically the hired hand that opened the chest, Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body? also buried in Jessica's aunt's farm. While Jessica is sure that she feels the presence of evil, she can put an end to Drew's plans and she will arrive in time to prevent him from becoming complete? <br /> <br /> I thought I was quite familiar with most of Universal's horror production before 1960, but this is a Universal 50's movie that is certainly little mentioned. While The Thing That Could not Die is not what I'd call a "good" movie, it has a few things to it. First, the film has some interesting ideas and is really quite ambitious. Director Will Cowan, whether by luck or intent, is able to give the film a pleasant atmosphere from time to time. And the special effects that surround the head are certainly scary. But the whole project is broken by acting. I am shocked to learn that any of the supposed "actors" of this thing appeared in anything else. You might think this was a kind of movie "one and done" for most of those involved. Kearney is the worst offender. She is awful. Besides, the thing that could not die may have been a little too ambitious for her own good. Given the budget and other limitations, there was no way the film aspired to its higher ideas. Finally, the movie abruptly ends. Just as things are starting to get interesting, The End. About what is it?
