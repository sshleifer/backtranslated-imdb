The people who criticize this movie were looking for it to be as cool and smooth as the first, which it is not. This movie was supposed to be the complete opposite of Ocean's 11. This was said by many of the cast members and also by the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, despite not having an exciting plot, is being knocked down because it was different than people wanted. If it was released before Ocean 11, it would be done in a very different way, not as a failed sequence. The problem with sequels is that people come into this with a pre-defined idea of ​​how it should be and have high expectations. They should get into this movie with an open mind and do not expect it to be "Ocean's 11, again."
