This is by far the most annoying and frustrating game I have ever encountered. Every time you turn around, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can not walk through. The cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements, but only slightly. Also, you have to play the game for about two hours just to pass the intro / tutorials. It's terrible! I'm afraid if I play this game, I'll end up breaking something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, the game, however, is horrible. To say that I hate this game would be a huge euphemism. I got this for sale, but I want my $ 20 back. What a waste!
