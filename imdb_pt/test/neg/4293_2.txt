I saw it as a child, before it was torn from the rotation, and yet it left a bad taste in my mouth. There were some jokes with competence, but making joking villains out of American citizens who had been interned in camps strictly because of their run was incredibly insipid. <br /> <br /> Moe himself might have wanted it buried. He was a liberal guy. In his autobiography, he said he had visited a segregated southern city, where he saw a black man coming off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close. Moe entered the street to show that it was not a problem, and the man then went back to the curb. Then off again. Finally the man told Moe nervously that if Moe did not stop trying to split the sidewalk with him, he could have both lynched. <br /> <br /> Another thing: there are ostrich eggs exploding, but no boi in the film, so the title should be (if anyone cares) "The Yolk on Me".
