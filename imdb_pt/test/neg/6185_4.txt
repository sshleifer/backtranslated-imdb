Anyone remember BRAVEHEART? It starred Mel Gibson, who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace. The movie contains more than 200 errors. Does anyone remember the GREEN BERETS? This is John Wayne's western, where the duke saves a home called Vietnam from a handful of communist tribe injunctions. If you watch WE WEERE SOLDIERS, you can not help but remember these two films. <br /> <br /> First of all, with that Scottish lament that was played three times in the movie, four if you count the final credits? I mean, what is the connection between Scotland and Nam? Maybe Wallace is using it in the vain hope that, because BRAVEHEART was bombed - imbecilically I might add - with several Oscars, then, could that movie be? Whatever the reason, it actually included it in jars. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was waiting for him to say something like "They will never take our freedom - Hell they go" and it is impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS as the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about the guilt in a scene almost identical to that seen in Wayne's movie <br /> <br /> When he is not reminding the public of others The WWS does not either is based on actual events in 1965 but does not seem to have the integrity needed to do justice to the story, never seems like 1965 and has no concept of time and place, probably because it was filmed in America not in Asia. Hal Moore could have brushed the French experience in Indochina, but if that is the case then it was unique because the American military struggled not to read about the Indo-Chinese war in France, indeed when asked about In the previous conflict, Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French "who have not won a war since Napoleon's time," so I was confused by the interpretation of the NVA in this film when in 1965 the American high command overflowing with arrogance, the North Vietnamese and the capitalist were despised. It is as if the story had been rewritten to show that Vietnamese rice farmers are superlative warriors. They are, but very few Americans believed in it in the mid-1960s. Are there any other things that confused me as housewives get telegrams saying their husbands are dead? No body is shown being taken back to the base and no one on the screen is seen referring to who was killed in the valley of La Drang. Likewise, we do not see reinforcements coming to the screen, so how do we suddenly see the Americans outside the NVA? I put them as directing / editing errors on Wallace's part, which does not impress me much as a director, and his biggest problem seems to be conveying the horror of the battle. Take the scene the American burned on a crisp is whisked away, "Tell my wife I love you." This should have an emotional impact similar to this death scene in PLATOON, but here there is no impact. In fact, I found the scene clich√©d and paternalistic, and he is not the only character to utter the words "Tell my wife ..." while mutilated or dying, I have counted at least two other characters using the phrase. Did characters really say that in battle? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS making my eyes water, I laughed at the FULL METAL JACKET, I watched my watch with the deer hunter, and after seeing that we were soldiers, I felt totally patronized
