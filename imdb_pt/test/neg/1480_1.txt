This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who stars as the energetic grandfather, Charlie, is in superactive mode hoping that the more flashy he is, the better his performance will be (ringing). Rod Steiger is one of the latest movie legends and seeing him in this movie (though End of Days being the second worst movie I've ever seen) is really bleak. From the bad plot to the non-existent direction, it becomes vaguely clear that the only reason this movie was made was that the producer's surname ended at DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad, it's really hysterical. Look at the flashback scene where Rod, where is a Superman Jor-El wig and a big black mustache. It is only expected that his follow-up film, I Believe in America, by Uber-producer Kevin Arbouet, rescue and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
