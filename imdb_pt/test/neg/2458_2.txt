What I left after watching this movie was a guilty conscience. The movie itself has a rather intriguing plot and premise for this, but unfortunately it is a movie that you can not watch without being bombarded with pornography. If you plan to see this and have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act to the pleasure of the audience, then you are making a big mistake. This is not the kind of movie with the symbolic sex scene that you can skip on your DVD player. Near the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character is filming his sexual exploits without his partner's knowledge. This tape and similar ones continue to appear throughout the film at unpredictable times. It seems the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of women. Ironically, in doing so, they turned many women into prostitutes. I only gave 2 instead of 1 because if they had dealt better with Baldwin's promiscuity, it would have been an interesting movie.
