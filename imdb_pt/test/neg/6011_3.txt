I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I could see, along with his reductivist verbiage, he offered reductivist narrative lines. This AF2A film transfiguration in a simplistic, pessimistic and elaborate narrative does not disorient me from my suspicions: a guy who barely sees action on the European battlefield (Hudson) falls in love with a nurse (Jones) and conspires to spend time together. Was Hemingway's great contribution to the narrative the romantic script? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so generic. The film never mentions the total irresponsibility necessary to abandon the front in favor of the adventure of a lover. The two have a season in the Alps, straight from a J. Crew catalog. A number of better scenes are hampered by corny and conventional melodrama elsewhere. The film continues to accumulate minute, improbable and non-specific details that combat epic treatment. The cavernous hospital where Ms. Barkley works is virtually empty, so that no secondary plot can distract from the fragile main story. Complicated, it is not. <br /> <br /> Camera work is better than average with an amazing location photography. Director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) Does remarkable things in the first hour with a big screen camera on the spot ... there are no second unit outputs. Vidor shows massive and panoramic mesas, on a row of hundreds of soldiers moving through the mountains; and then, with a 90-degree turn of his camera, he reaches the Hudson ambulance. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks great. He is a better actor than he deserves credit, but with an unshaped material like that, he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional muse. Jennifer Jones is swollen and miscast in the lackluster female lead. The movie is best when it's off screen. The love scenes are as affective as a coffee commercial.
