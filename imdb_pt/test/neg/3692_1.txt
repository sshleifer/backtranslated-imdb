In Moscow, Father Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him into the underworld to find his missing friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell under the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting photos on the cover. I'm totally disappointed because this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer agreed to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews on the IMDb promoting this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review on this site. There are two possible ways to see this annoying and terrible movie: my wife and I often doze off because of the monotony of this meaningless story, and we use the DVD rewind button to repeat every scene lost. However, the correct route should have been the use of the fast forward or stop button, to end this crap faster. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Shadow Town" ("City of Darkness")
