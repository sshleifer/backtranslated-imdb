It's been a long time since my wife and I did not see such a boring thriller. It's definitely not an exciting story and it's so slow that we almost fall asleep. This could be a series of TV crimes with very low budget. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one in which the mafia boss Pirano wants to see the lady of the jury in a red suit or another mafioso can not stop to think about her and so on. Okay, maybe this should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me, you really do not miss anything. We gave it 4/10.
