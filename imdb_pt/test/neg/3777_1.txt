The parallels between this film and Captain Walrus (an independent film screened at the 1994 Team Projection Film Festival) are so incredibly obvious that any compliment to "Sally Marshall Is Not An Alien" should be seen with the knowledge that he is walking about the success of another job. In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen, respectively) examine the bizarre behavior of their new neighbor, Britney (played by Louise Farley). ). As the two boys peer through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform whom they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis on Captain Walrus is on the useless and somewhat hungry actions by the power of the neighbor Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> A critical success at the film festival, Captain Walrus's plot was obviously appropriate and rewritten in order to give the Australian Film Community another level with regard to child product. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien is a great movie, and a credit to its producers, its lack of authenticity leaves something to be deserved.
