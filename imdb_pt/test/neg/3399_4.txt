This is just a long ad for the movie "The Death Tunnel". Although an interesting story from the Waverly Hills Sanitarium, the whole theory of ghosts depends on their interpretation. More "Ghost Orbs" that you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and the "Ectoplasmic Haze" is just the cigarette smoke of someone lit up with the camera flash. I could not see any "Shadow People" until they drew an outline around the blurred distortion of the image. No scientific explanation was suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. Maybe these are just events you would have to believe in, so be sure to make plans to visit the Sanitarium on your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
