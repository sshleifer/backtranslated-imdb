I saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented as interesting. I saw the rating of IMDb and 6.8 confirmed it would be an above average movie. So it was to see. <br /> <br /> Is the story about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ?? a pretty girl in high school who is a guy of male sexual desire. The provocation of Michael's friend Emmett (Michael Welch) to another colleague to show his love for Mandy, leaves the student drunk and leaps to death. Nine months go by and Mandy is invited to a summer weekend at a ranch isolated by her teenage friends? three girls and three boys go there! There is a Garth security guard (Anson Mount) who works at the ranch. During the first night itself do the kills happen ?? one by one, the group members are killed. Who is behind the murders? Am I not going to say here to ruin sports? I like the movie? DO NOT. After the usual interesting opening ?? the film takes a downward turn with every unfolding of the event. At intervals, when the killer is revealed, all interest in the remaining procedures is lost. There is one last twist in history to shock viewers, but it made me shake my head in disbelief and laugh! All this for suspense? There is??! Does Amber Heard act and play her role as a shy and self-conscious girl? who is aware of her beauty and the desire of men for her. The remaining cast is usual ?? nothing to say about. Are there so many movies made of teenage boys and girls going to an isolated place and slowly killing them one by one? that does not interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine struggles to make the film interesting using contemporary conversations of teenagers, loaded with sexual connotations, but does not allow the film to outweigh the mundane. <br /> <br /> The only and most attractive saving grace of the film is the cinematography of Darren Genet ?? who captures beautiful perfect images!
