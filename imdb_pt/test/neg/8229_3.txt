This is not a very good movie, but it's easily the best Troma Studios movie I've ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - the "brains" behind Troma - is not worried about a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining movie. His main concern is to do something bizarre. And its definition of bizarre often mirrors my definition of terrible cinema. <br /> <br /> In this movie we have the character titled Luther - whose favorite pastime is not Baseball, but bite the heads of the chickens - getting their release. Block. The board considered him rehabilitated despite the fact that he did not talk - he just shits like a chicken - and has a set of razor blade dentures at his disposal. Of course, once Luther is released, he will cause chaos, first in a grocery store and then in a farmhouse. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Much violence in this often tasteless Luther sinks his razor blades into a poor old lady who waits at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the movie terrorizing her mother and the daughter on the farm). <br /> <br /> NUDDADE: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk delivers a skin noteworthy in her photo, like the old Lois Lane (I can not remember which Superman edition she was) gives us a scene of bathing followed by bedtime play with her boyfriend - a guy who does not do anything I have no chemistry with Mrs. Haiduk.The shower scene scene in the DVD extras gives the viewer a little more of Stacy.It is a thing and so much). The manner in which Luther is released from the asylum completely excludes all credibility from the window. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!!) The script of Whitey Styles may be the worst ever written. preschooler can write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd.It's as if Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations. : The movie belongs to Edward Terry, who actually does a decent job as the Geek. He is quite menacing in a stupid barn fashion, and Joan Roth, like the mother, does a super supportive job, but the lack of chemistry of Haiduk and her boyfriend made their roles strange at best).
