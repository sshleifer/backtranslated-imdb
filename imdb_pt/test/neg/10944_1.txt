Most people have the luxury of typing the title of a movie and discovering the movie before watching it, but unfortunately I've never been one of those types of people. I would not even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to it, because if you ignore these warnings and even give the movie a chance after it flies in theaters, you're coming in at your own risk, a bad taste in your mouth, which is exactly how I feel about this stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only good thing about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap are some of the songs (and seriously excluding the title track). Even the ever-promising talent of Kangana Renaut (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here while playing Ruhi, the woman who captured the attention of both male protagonists played by Bobby Deol (who makes AJ a rootless music producer ) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, a close artist who crosses the path of AJ). Celina Jaitley provides the right amount of OOMPH required from a socialite that is abandoned by Reggi (whom she helped put her foot in the door of the music industry). This does not look like a mix or movie that should have included Anupam Kher, right? Well, you're wrong because he's in him as the father of Reggi (another wasted talent). <br /> <br /> The movie may not have been so bad if they had not killed the text behind the character of Deol too much. The moral message was very preaching (revenge had a dark and somber side) and the ending was too exaggerated for you to wonder why you sat for such a silly movie in the first place. Truly, this is the epitome of crap.
