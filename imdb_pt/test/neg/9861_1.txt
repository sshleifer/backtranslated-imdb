What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine do best is plunge into the psyche of Garry Kasparov during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unraveled, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that looked very human to his preconceived notion of chess computers. Kasparov then thought, and still does, that IBM cheated. <br /> <br /> Game Over attempts to sound impartial, but of course the director thinks IBM cheated. However, they do not give real evidence to support the cheating claim, only hints that IBM's security around the computer room was because IBM really had great hidden masters replacing the computer on certain important occasions, and the assertion of Kasparov's that the computer did not play like a computer usually does at one point in game two. In game two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer by trying to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to computer loss. Deep Blue did not take the bait, and Kasparov was so shaken because the computer seemed to play like a human who did not even see that he could have played Deep Blue for a draw and ended up giving up. This game got him so excited that he could not recover, and after playing 3.4 and 5 in draws, he lost game 6 horribly. <br /> <br /> The question of whether IBM betrayed everything boils down to that single move in Game Two, where Deep Blue made the move that any human would, but that, up to that point, stumbled on computers. Joel Benjamin, a great chess master of IBM's programming team, explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always stumbled in this situation and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue not to make the mistake of other computers they do. If you believe Benjamin's statement, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM's explanations for the rest of the film, preferring to cut pictures of 19th-century chess The Turk and photos of Deep Blue, implying that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human as well. As someone who has an understanding of programming, IBM's explanation makes perfect sense - if you knew what you were doing, it would not be too difficult to put something into the code so that if so and so the conditions were met, then do so and so - in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one Kasparov created in Game 2 has already happened. This is not cheating, you are doing a good job of programming a chess computer. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is eminently clear that the director thinks IBM cheated, and repeated comments on IBM's stock rose 15%. the day Deep Blue won suggested the idea that IBM cheated to raise its stock price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there is an abundance of external opinions, both in chess and in computer science communities, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply could not get over his view of computers as "idiot machines" for a machine that did not look so dumb after all. I just wish the director had let us see the alternative opinion. <br /> <br />
