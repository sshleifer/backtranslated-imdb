Is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscellaneous? <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave, despite being a top actress, seems to be joining her kids instead of napping on the couch. (I would love to see Brenda Blethlyn in part, despite her connection to the latest Pride and Prejudice). <br /> <br /> Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only ones who felt that they lived with their characters spirit and performance. Everyone seemed confused or out of place. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I'm not very familiar with Dr. Who (I've only seen a few episodes so far) or would have definitely soured this even more. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Mansfield Park has not yet seen what it deserves on the screen (whether big or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully.
