This is a horrible movie !! Some people told me it was not that bad, but I certainly disagree! The monster is incredibly cheap (and funny), but that's something we all knew, I guess. Besides, the dialogues are horrible and the writing is just terrible. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, this movie like the quality of being fun. Not always for the good reasons, but it's a good movie "so bad it's fun". <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no such thing as "La Castagne". According to a secondary character in the film called Pierre (described in the film as a Canadian Frenchman), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It sure made me laugh though ... :))
