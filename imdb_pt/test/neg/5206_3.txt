I kind of liked the movie, it's just that the characters run with no real point to their madness. Like I was saying, poor goat. The goat was nah while the guy was pretending to stick it. I wish the rape scenes were more graphic (not the one with the goat). Jane Ryall who played Celia just made this movie. She was very naked everywhere. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about the couple of gay transvestites who are also chosen because they are sinners. If you like crazy things, then this is your movie. 3/10
