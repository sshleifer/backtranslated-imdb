With all his technical flash, the movie "Stalingrad" of 1993 is very disappointing. Before watching, I had read non-fiction accounts of the Stalingrad campaign and seen many documentary footage and photographs of the royal battle and its participants. I do not think any film can really portray the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German production would look like. Although there are some good elements of this film, overall it is a failure. To me, the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some well-planned elements and clichés, most glaringly in some encounters between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also some ideological elements in the film that result in very distorted perceptions, including what amounts to a caricature of a German chaplain, some exaggerated class war messages, and problematic representations of "good" Germans, versus "bad". Certainly the German Armed Forces of World War II included men who managed to maintain some decency during the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the film to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I credit "Stalingrad" in the sense that it does not completely portray German troops in the sheer demonic quality that is the stereotype that many people now have, although the film includes stereotypes of its own, almost as well. to be a true infantryman who behaves more like the 1990s than the 1940s, and two completely evil infantrymen and a high-ranking officer. Some recent films like "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private" Ryan are often praised for their "authenticity" in describing graphic combat scenes, but these same films are deeply flawed and distorted in their representations of attitudes, values, and behaviors of soldiers and civilians of 1940. "Stalingrad" and "SPR" have larger and smaller characters who lack the unconscious stoicism that was common among ordinary people during the Second World War period. of history have been notorious for their frequent grunts and occasional cynicism, but the selfish, full-bodied, and sensitive characters in both films are something else, and are far more prevalent in our world today than in the other days. many people nowadays like to denigrate war films of the 40s and 50s that present more patriotic messages and are not as illustrative as the combat, m Uses of earlier films such as "Battlefield" are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers. Attitudes, and they are often successful in showing the horrific effects of war in more indirect ways. A well-made piece of "Stalingrad" is a battle between the German infantry and Soviet tanks, which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such fighting. "Stalingrad" does a lousy job of showing the front-line soldier's common appearance. Part of this may be due to the difficulty in finding skinny and downcast extras in our hearty, well-fed America and Western Europe today. In addition, many of the German troops in the film do not wear their uniforms and equipment properly, and do not show the professional bearing that was common in the German Wehrmacht, even during the years of German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of ​​what the German troops looked like, I recommend the following documentaries that contain images from Stalingrad's campaign: "World at War", "War of the Century" and "War of Russia". Paul Carell's books "Operation Barbarossa in Photographs", Geoffrey Jukes' "Stalingrad" and Paul Carell's "Stalingrad" contain many useful photos. It is also recommended books written about the battle by Antony Beevor and William Craig, and the latter is especially good on soldiers and civilians common on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films that, in my opinion, are far better than "Stalingrad" and "The Rescue of Private Ryan" in portraying people's attitudes and characters during World War II, and the general feeling , horror and cunning of this war are "Der Untergang" ("The Fall") and "Talvisota" ("The Winter War"). While "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Longest Day" cover events on the Western Front rather than the East, they are also excellent war films, and are very close to factual accounts. The last two films lack a part of the grain that is most prevalent in more recent films, but they compensate for this lack with its other strengths, including veracity.
