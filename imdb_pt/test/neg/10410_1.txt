Are you kidding me? The music was so loud in this show that I often did not even hear the dialogue. And the music was not good at all. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door ??? And the cloud of mushrooms seemed very close to having so little instant devastation. Anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this. I felt like a bunch of sit-ins with actors been sent on the spot and did not know what to do with the dramatic dialogue. And what a Kansas teenager knows about shopping in Soho ... could not we have a better line here? He was bored to tears and only kept awake by the strident sound of music mixed with loud music.
