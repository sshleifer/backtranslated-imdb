Creating a comedy is like walking with a fine rope. Either it works or it does not work. Grandma's Boy is one of those movies that does not work. It may have some very funny parts, but for the most part, it's just a terribly bland comedy of the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler's films (without Sandler himself, he's just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35 years old and is the best tester and game player in his boy-filled workplace. He ends up getting his apartment and his things taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just spent the money of rent on Filipino prostitutes and did not pay the landlord). Desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and his two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the basic plot of the movie, played with subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha. (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as Velma in Scooby Doo) trying to get the testers to conclude a new game as quickly as possible, a robotic game that creates prodigy JP (Joel Moore) who works with Alex and uses the same clothes that Neo in The Matrix and, of course, all sorts of sex-related jokes and drugs. That's it. The problem with the film, aside from the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is solved in the last fifteen minutes of the movie, is that this is not funny. It's totally boring, and just moderately funny. Nothing really happens at all. No emotion, no real sense of direction, and a ton of intense swearing. You find yourself laughing at some funny jokes that the actors say, but you feel completely bored, wishing you did not even care about the movie. How this movie was lit up and how Fox thought he could make money will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is simply no entertainment value to come from it. Neither actor is actually performing well, they are just acting like idiots to the camera and hoping for the best. Stoner's comedy was made several times and, from time to time, it works (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here, it just makes the movie even less funny than it already is. The random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of naked breasts does not really make the movie any better. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few funny phrases, this movie must be completely lost. It's not very funny, the whole plot is silly, it's annoying, and it just makes a horrible movie. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
