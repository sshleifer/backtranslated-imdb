Let's get one thing straight: I really like Snipes' work. Unlike his other contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme), he may actually act. This film, however, does little to improve its reputation; is not exactly indecipherable - but I'm also in no hurry to watch it again. In fact, if I never saw him again, it would not bother me - there are just a few better movies to waste my time! It's a shame, because with a little imagination and some subtle changes, this could have been a worthwhile movie. Instead, the director chose to almost pitch his audience into submission with too much exaggerated violence and too little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have is with Snipes' co-star, Silvia. Colloca It confuses me that the producers of this film have bothered to hire a gorgeous and gorgeous (by my money) and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then give her a pathetic and one-dimensional character to play with. If she was hired to simply add a bit of "glamor" to the film, she does not even do it very well; there is no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worthy of mention. Strange, really. Given the amount of violence in this film, it surprises me that the producers have adopted such a conservative attitude toward sex and nudity. Are we living in 2007 or in 1957? What the producers of this junk (and probably the actors too) have forgotten is that movies are meant to be costumes. Like most of the inhabitants of this planet, my real life is very boring. I would love to be chasing terrorists, to be able to behave like Mr. Snipes and get involved with a beautiful young lady like Miss Colloca. This movie does not suit these fantasies very well. Which is precisely why I'm giving you such a bad review!
