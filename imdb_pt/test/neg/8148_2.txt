This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene where we have the appearance of Mel Torme as a big bad leader of the Jaguar muffin gang (and this is a party in itself), for the final image of Mamie Van Doren, now a rehabilitated angelic teenager coming out of prison (err .. the house of a kind girl run by iron fist nuns), you can not stop shaking your head. The cast of this film is a cheesy list of Mel and Mamie for the talented Paul Anka (all I wanted for most of the movie was for him to just STOP SINGING!) And the King of Forties, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, playing a humorless teenage girl with more than a few chops (judo, not acting), last saw me in the horrible misogynist 50 of the Leech Woman prank, with a hairdo so bad it looked like a dead groundhog that had been crushed by a Mac Truck. Mamie is a bad girl - she smokes, scolds, runs wild, beats teachers, and walks around with gang leaders. She leaves her idiot, Jaguar, driving her boyfriend Chip (we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl, before he falls for a nice guy) and starts talking to Dick Contino. If that's a step forward for her, nobody knows. Mel appears at a party where she is with her new boyfriend, and accuses her of pushing the nasty Chip off the cliff. While I'm sure she would have liked it, she was not there. A stupid fight scene between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz freaks follows, with some hilariously bad moves on both sides. <br /> <br /> Mamie ends up being sent to the girls' city, a reform school .. errr. ..level at home for errant girls ... led by Sister Iron Pants and their fellow correctional sisters. She irritates the nuns (and us), spreading out, throwing away the phrases in a bad mood and usually showing how bad she is. She quickly encounters Gloria Talbot, playing one of the ill-behaved girls, who gives her a talcum so she knows her place. She knows a pasta from a girl obsessed with Paul Anka's character (why?). This little trickle becomes your "henchman." <br /> <br /> There is a long movie in which nothing happens except that St. Paul of Anka keeps showing up and proving how holy he is. He sings too much in this interval, until you want to slap him in his huge snozz to keep him quiet! And Mamie's younger sister, played by Father Know's Best Princess, calls her to tell her she's in trouble. It turns out it was sis that went out with Chipster, and now Mel is blackmailing her because he found out. All the girls go out to save her, with a hysterical fight scene between the girls, Mel and her boys. this is after a run between Mel and Dick that is so stupid that it confuses the mind. The gifted teens in this tacky movie have a fabulous time playing with what is basically a silly, poorly written, and morally boring movie that does not carry none if your goals - unless your goal is to make you laugh out loud.
