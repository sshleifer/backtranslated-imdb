This show is perhaps one of the most boring, boring shows I've ever seen. While the mood was subtle and I'm all for subtle humor; The jokes were not funny. <br /> <br /> The show is about two Kiwis in their thirties who live in New York trying to start their musical careers. <br /> <br /> I saw that episode in which Brett leaves the other Kiwi behind during an assault. Okay, the plot idea has potential; but I had the feeling that half the episode was just filling, and the other half was really important to the story. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that they kept explaining how the one left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust of the other guy. I have some advice for the writers: mention this once to idiots who can not understand the way he's acting, and move on. <br /> <br /> And I thought the characters were annoying. . The character who left the other behind, Brett, came across as being overly innocent and naive, the one left behind was out there talking in this monotonous, robotic voice. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was the manager of the band. was obviously incompetent, but he was the character I liked. He is also the only one who won the show a star rating. <br /> <br /> All in all, a show that I have no intention of watching again.
