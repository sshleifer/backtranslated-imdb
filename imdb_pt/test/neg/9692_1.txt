I could not believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors appearing in this terrible effort that should never have been done. The plots are terrible and the dialogue appauling (at first I thought it was a parody), and the acting terrible. Everything is bad, from cheap scenarios to fake scenarios, a lot of enlarged paintings. Reputable filmmakers struggle to get their vision noticed, but this blasphemous and pathetic attempt at a mini-series hits our televisions, with three Oscar winners making appearances. I can only imagine that everyone involved somehow hurt the screenwriter and director and were forced (perhaps under gun-toting) to star in this useless junk TV.
