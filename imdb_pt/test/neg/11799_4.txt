Ted Nicolaou has made many horror and fantasy films. I'm looking for all your movies to see. I have not been able to find this for 3 years, until I found it unexpectedly on youtube. To tell you the truth, I wanted to see more ghosts and fewer conversations here. It seems that in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis, maybe in cash. Its features from that time seem more like junk thrash z movies with real low budget. But I do not claim he's a bad director this time. Everything happens. The ending has some scary and suspenseful details, but the whole movie was long bland dialogues. <br /> <br /> Just for the true fans of Ted. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
