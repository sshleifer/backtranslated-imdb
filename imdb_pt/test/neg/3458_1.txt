FILTH! I accidentally watched this movie thinking it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003. I regret seriously missing an hour of my life sitting me through it. What a shame for who gave this garbage a prize. I totally hated this movie - in fact I did not see it until the end. After an hour I could not take it anymore. I'm disgusted that people have fun with such a bad script - that tries and can not get a dozen other stories of human interest and such BA-AD acting out. PAINFUL. I rated 1 star out of 10. An amateur could make a much, much bigger movie.
