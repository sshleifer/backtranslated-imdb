This howler monkey from the 50's is so bad that it is, unintentionally, funny. Tom Conway plays Dr. Gerard, a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo. His poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is being held captive by her wacky husband who has no time for her, but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. Along comes Marla English as a greedy assassin who has already killed a man to find a treasure in the jungle. Her idiot boyfriend, played by Lance Fuller, is on the safari. They hire "Touch" Connors, (later renamed as Mike Connors of Mannix) as their guide. English is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast was turning into academic rewards as well. "Touch" (I'm sorry, I can not even type the name without cracking, I mean, what ...) gave half of the group just decent performance and that's saying a lot. The monster is seen only briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. I would say that this movie fits into the movie category "it's so bad, it's almost good." It's good on a rainy night when nothing else is in the tube.
