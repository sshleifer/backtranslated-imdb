What a prolonged painful experience. <br /> <br /> This is more than two hours of my life, I will never go back. <br /> <br /> The pleasure of the Director of the Film Festival - is flooded with the excessive use of the long and slow shot .... however - that is not the only thing that makes a script. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
