From weeks and weeks of promotion to this, "The One" by ABC, should be "The Real World" and "American Idol." We should see these singers perform, compete and see how they lived together in a house as well. The drama! The tension! <br /> <br /> Where can we start with this atrocity? Let's start with the "judges" who were known as "Music Experts" in this program. "Specialists" implies that they have experience. Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a while. The other two ... huh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair with three distinct, fluorescent colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And the aspiring Paula Abdul, who did something I did not think could happen: she was even more breathless and nauseating than Paula! She then corrected and became severely critical after the first episode. The farce of "criticism" these three offered was a real joke and an insult, not only for the process of finding the best singer, but for the audience that is now quite experienced, having done it numerous times on Fox. /> <br /> There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, it was as dull as it could be. He really sucked in the little energy that was in the program, dry. How he got this job was the second biggest mystery of the show. <br /> <br /> The first was how they chose the 11 contestants for this program? This was literally a talent show without talent. IT'S OK. Maybe it's an exaggeration. And granted, the artists all have to be relatively close in ability, because if they were not, there would not be a "contest". If only one person were "good," there would be no "suspense." So I understand that everyone needed to be comparable. But they should all have * some * chops! In addition, the judges were directing a "singing academy", so the program was also part of the "Fame". Obviously, these artists desperately needed these lessons. But you need extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that was definitely not what was happening here. <br /> <br /> It seemed that when launching the show, the priority was on the elements "homelife", as all players were very attractive to look at, in equal parts with how badly they vocalized. But the segments filmed in your house were so cut and sliced ​​that you could not get into the stories that were beginning to happen, so the show did not capture the events there either. <br /> <br /> As all of this was, "The One" had an incredible, unbelievable and fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable. <br /> <br /> The audience phoned their votes for whom they liked the most. , as well as in "AI". But then, after the audience vote was revealed, the three lower participants were forced to sing one last song. The "music experts", based on this performance, chose one person out of three to save money the following week. AND THEN, the competitors who were secure were able to vote on who they wanted to keep from the remaining two, sending the rest of the competitor home. <br /> <br /> The "design flaw" was that the competitors had the final say. I mean, if you were in a music competition and wanted to go as far as you could, would you vote for KEEP, the best singer, or try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any viewer of the first season of CBS '"Survivor" could answer that! And that's exactly what happened on the show. The person who had the best potential was lost, and the contestants voted back "the one" who had no talent! In addition, the competitor who was saved from the fund by the "experts" was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete fake! <br /> <br /> Maybe if they let competitors vote first, at least the "experts" would save the best of two evils to end. But this only confirms how this show was not ready to be broadcast, as the whole process was unsatisfactory and how misguided the producers were trying.
