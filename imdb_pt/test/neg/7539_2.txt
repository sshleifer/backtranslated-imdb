Unlike most of the comments in this section, I have to say that this movie only escapes the definition of 'junk!'. The only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalog of clich√©s are are those who, like me, live in the northeast and know firsthand what the area looks like. I'm totally fed up with movies that are supposed to be "realistic" but portray the working class (everywhere) as idiots and criminals, but then excuse them because of their social background. It is funny? I smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but that was the incongruity of two male actors with Sunderland accents supposedly trying to hide their Newcastle accents from the Sunderland fans! There was only one nice character in the entire film, and this was the senile grandfather who played quietly, but with great skill, by Roy Hudd - the only non-Geordie in the cast. <br /> <br /> As for the writing - Well, I only wonder in which department of sociology of the university the author studied. He certainly had no ears to the local accent. And I've also never heard the expression "Purely Belter" - and I'm not just a native, I'm a linguist who writes articles on the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time and sight on this garbage. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not fun and it's fundamentally dishonest.
