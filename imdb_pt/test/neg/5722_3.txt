Okay, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in a sickening way, I only have a crush on 6 tall women with swords. There I said that. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost all the mistakes you can make have been committed. You get a series of hit movies (conan) and drag it in the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects and the worst thing of all ... you put a cute kid there for comic relief. That sort of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series, you know. Cute kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen at least took the film seriously, although it seems that no one else did. The plot had Schwarzenegger repeatedly stripping Red Sonja's fat from the fire and that considerably impaired his character. A warrior woman does not need a guy to get her out of a mess, it's her job! Not reusing the character Conan in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh The movie never set the mood, and its rhythm was quite disjointed and sloppy, unlike Conan the barbarian, who had several gracefully flowing story lines. When it comes to fantasy films, it's okay to have cheesy clothes, it's okay to have a harryhausen style animation, it's okay to have exorbitant sets that do not make sense, but having a horrible script is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a classic, but the script seemed to have been written by a 12 year old.
