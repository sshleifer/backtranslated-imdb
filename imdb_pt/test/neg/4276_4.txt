The whole exercise is useless. Why make the movie? The lighting is awful, but the sound is just a joke. As a high school production. Whoever puts the budget together for this movie should be drawn and quartered to allow it to be done without the proper budget for soundmen with recording equipment. <br /> <br /> Both dialogs are unintelligible due to loss of echo or lack of proximity to the microphone. The economy should have been done in any other area. All production is lifeless and just LAME with a semi-arsed amateur production. It lacks warmth, clarity and has no design for it.
