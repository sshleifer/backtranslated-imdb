I just watched Fingersmith, and I'm shocked to see the average of 8/10 for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only was the plot difficult to follow, but it seems that the character's development was applied randomly. The actors were adequate, but in the process of trying to create twists and turns, their characters are rendered entirely one-dimensional. Once that happens, the story really becomes monotonous and becomes boring. <br /> <br /> And in case someone does not see the subtle predictable lesbian contours miles away, this is hammered in the most banal terms at the end. of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final scene is disappointing and phoned, and anyone who would sit and leave "Ohhh, so they were always rolling up carpets!", must have gone out for the night. Two stars for the hockey of the tonsils in the previous scene, which was at least a bit cheeky, none for the rest ...
