I woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and I imagined having a movie, something new, a horror movie, maybe? Like many other reviewers I came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a golden wrapper. The cover is great, and the comment on the back is fascinating - "this will scare you" ... oh how I laughed looking at such naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> The many things that are more frightening than this movie are the acting skills of these "actors". I do not think so, I really cheered when they were cut down by those 'scarecrows' who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes. I used to go through cornfields very quickly, as I found them quite scary at night, but having seen this movie, I almost got wet (laughing so hard) just by sight. <br /> <br /> I've seen the most frightening omelette, honestly, but not mine, I'm a handyman in omelette cooking, and if somebody associates that movie with my omelet, let's just say I'd create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If anyone has some good (not pop) corn film you can recommend, feel free to let me know. It's a great comedy, if nothing else, fine. Enjoy, but a little advice - before pressing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out the window.
