It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' with Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. Both were large-budget Chinese kung fu movies with a breathtaking cinematography of the Chinese landscape and a cast of Super stars. But beyond the obvious there is nothing left to compare. The 'Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that great star names, beautiful scenery, and action effects do not replace the art and vision of a director. <br /> <br /> All the previous marketing hype the premiere of 'Hero' did nothing more than make a spectacular failure. Long-awaited, 'Hero' attracted crowds of viewers when it debuted in theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, becoming an instant box office hit. However, while the script has pleased government censors, the Chinese public has come to new discoveries of caustic criticism and sarcastic humor to express their disdain. Online critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film "ideologically disturbing," "from the point of view of deep bondage," written "by an amateur historian or by someone with ulterior motives." One article was simply titled "Hero, You Make Me Sick!" <br /> <br /> The film's deepest failure lies in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historical fallacy, but - worst of all for a movie - it sucks! All successful epic movies are known to take some liberties with the facts of the story, but "Hero" goes beyond the artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it tries to glorify an emperor who was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. "Hero" does not compensate for this lack of moral compass being fun or fun. Instead, it is a lamentably poor attempt to be "deep" and merely succeeds in being pretentious and prejudiced. Although historians agree that the First Emperor of China was relentlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have Admired this ruler - not surprising, given Mao's own tyrannical regime. Similarly, the communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can be easily traced between the First Emperor and his own iron fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work of Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the Hero stars, commented during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989, crushing the student demonstrations because it was necessary to maintain "stability" in China. For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocking reviews in his hometown of Hong Kong, but he simply stated out loud the underlying message of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou said his goal was to overcome the problem. values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in novels and kung-fu movies, to reveal superior wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" ends up being: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality conveyed this message, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could truly find the freedom of such tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to escape an alternative world: where kung-fu warriors roamed the country in search of adventure and fought for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their superhuman abilities. Only in the novel did the individual manage to conquer institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their advocates. Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou did not rise to a higher truth, as he expected, but down, at the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so pleased. Some film lovers may secretly ask themselves, "Are all moral judgments aside? Is it at least fun?" Fortunately, the answer is a resonant "No!" Because the same tale is told over and over again with small variations, it becomes tedious to watch. In addition, the three conflicting versions of the same story serve only to confuse character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them when the "real" version comes up. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without its beautiful images. However, all scenes are weak because they do not connect or enhance the plot. The use of different colors to distinguish separate versions of the tale is simplistic and artificial, and cinematography seems consciously more than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer but a disappointment since you are there to watch the whole movie. <br /> <br /> For those in China who showed contempt for the unrealistic kung-fu of 'Crouching Tiger', much was expected of 'Hero'. 'Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a true kung-fu artist who held national titles before starting his acting career. His previous films revealed limited acting skills, but many expected Zhang Yimou to use Li's agile body movements in full force, while putting him in a role that would not challenge his acting skills. But it was not meant to be. The 'Hero' tries to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of action: an inner transformation that leads to deep wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director should have waited, Li failed miserably. Meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu ability is the first of the film, between Li and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so 'Hero' can not satisfy, even at that level. While most audiences outside China are probably not aware of the historical confusion of the cruel First Emperor's history, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of "Chinese wisdom," which is anything but that. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a 'Hero' exhibit was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was in the special display for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
