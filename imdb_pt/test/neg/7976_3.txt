Supreme Sanction is a movie about a killer who works for the US government. She has to kill a known TV reporter, but saves her life when she sees that he has a little girl. Because she did not kill him, she becomes the next target of his employers. <br /> <br /> The script is not good, although I have seen B movies worse. A murderer with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of the fight against terror, ... What next? Aliens rescuing the victim ??? No, the Supreme Sanction will never win any awards because of the script. And acting is not better, I'm afraid. Some well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had many accounts to pay for and so agreed to play in that film, along with other actors who probably do not even know what a camera really looks does not do the film any good either. <br /> <br /> So, why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do, than watch some action movie and you're tired of the 10,531th replay of Mc Gyver or Team A, then this may be the movie you want to see. Otherwise, you'd better leave him alone. I give it a 3/10.
