Tony Curtis and Skip Homier are wearing black with white canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the pool and tank being blown up. Must have been very hard with young stars feet. If the real Marines were on the mission, they would be wearing boots. In the first scenes they stripped off just before starting their short trip to find the Farmer. When they went to the area where they dug the fox holes Tony and Skip are wearing combat boots, then later when Lovejoy and Curtis rushed to the Framer and their daughter Tony is wearing the "sneakers" but they were blackened. The movie about a true story, but do they really need the love interest?
