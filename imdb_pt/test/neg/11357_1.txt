If you want to lose a small part of your life, sit down before this predictable zombie movie. It fails in the first post by not being scary OR funny. It's a boring gray movie that I think went straight to the video. Hammy and tongue on the cheek acting leave a bitter taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a recent, poor but still watchable zombie movie, check out the Diary of the Dead. Bad special effects, school level screenplay. Zombie movies work if they have a moral or even political point. This movie has nothing, there is no point worthy that stands out zombification. This is as exciting and compelling as a Republican Convention, it's not worth seeing the Republican Convention would be the best example of a zombie movie.
