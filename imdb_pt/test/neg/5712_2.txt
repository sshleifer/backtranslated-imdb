This is high-gloss soft porn; a boring novel that focuses on one thing: sex. They actually had boring sex, sad to say, because I dare you to watch it casually and tell me what the plot was. What this is, it's an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off his great body and for Mickey Rourke to smile a lot. That's it. Rourke's presumption is so bad that it is disgusting, and Bassinger, despite the great figure, seems cheaper than handsome. Congratulations to the photographer for some beautiful close-up photos and some wonderful colors, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - is unable to compensate. Let's face it: this film was made just for the sake of - to excite the male viewers. At that level, he probably got it. If I remember correctly, that's why I took a look as a fan of Bassinger's appearance, but I really expected a story as well. <br /> <br /> Those who try to pass this on as "artistic" and something deeper than the soft porn are just fooling around.
