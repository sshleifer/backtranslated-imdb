It seems like there is great potential for the history of this movie to be something worth watching. The performance was flat and the story had no depth. There was a lot of confidence in the work of the camera, which had some high points. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I just wanted to read before buying the DVD. The movie may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand. There could have been much further development of the plot because there is a homelessness in Moscow (ie post-Soviet "capitalism", overuse of drugs (increased heroin trafficking in Afghanistan), further development of the resurgence of Russian orthodoxy after the fall of the USSR, the archaeologists themselves, or even more in the struggle against nihilism.
