I do not think it really matters much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you will notice is the extreme amateurishness of the whole production. Performance is what you would have if you randomly picked people on the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the excitement of a shot in your ear, while at the same time the dialogue is perhaps a fifth higher. Several noises in the set dominate the large-scale soundtrack, with dialogue occupying a distant backseat. The theme song sounds like it was about a quarter when the movie was released, since large parts of the movie have no music at all. The camera work can best be described as a twisted mess, with close-up photos in which an average angle would be much better, cameramen walking and pushing the camera around, absolutely no attention to frame any scene, they just filmed it all of whatever position would be most convenient for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the top of everyone's head, well, so be it. Editing is just a butcher job; Everything is played as abruptly as possible, nothing flows or transits in any sense of the word. I do not know if this was filmed on video or maybe a rental camcorder, I usually think it was the last one. <br /> <br /> I made only three-quarters of the way before I hung up, I was so annoyed by the poor quality of production that I could not stand it anymore. It's like a ninth grade audiovisual class project.
