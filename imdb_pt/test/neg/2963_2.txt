That was on TV last night. I painfully forced my way through it, and could barely pass. First of all, except for Leroy, Hilary, and possibly Coco, NONE of the other students we have to worry about has some discernible talent. It's as if the HSPA did not have standards, just sign on the dotted line and you're in. <br /> <br /> The story lines were blatant and obvious. Doris was simply incredibly awful. The gay guy was a clich√© so thrown out (funny how that school had just a gay guy, right ...) I liked the character Leroy, but calling his teacher obscenity and vandalizing the school should have sent Leroy packing. Lisa seems like she'd rather be anywhere else, and since she was not a talent, I wonder why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I would have rated this (horrible) star, but the music was not that bad, and I liked the premise. It would only have worked much better if the students had been attractive and had some talent.
