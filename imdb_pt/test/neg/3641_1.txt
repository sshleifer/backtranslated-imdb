Okay, where do I start? I can not even imagine realizing this pretentious pathetic excuse of a show. Imagine this: an inner boarding school, where children whose parents are playing money simply throw them in, to travel the world. Could not be more diabolical than that. <br /> <br /> If you taught these children, you would not upgrade them to the term teenagers, because they hardly act as healthy homosexuals, they are egocentric, think again. . About 23 minutes suffocated by their so-called problems, problems with boys and things like that. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the show, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Polly Pocket, from Britney Little Miss I'm All This sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously has a lot to learn about acting. However, I will give you a face, because its superficial, one-dimensional character does not allow much space for depth. She interprets the sun, moon and stars of the Pacific Coast Academy, fighting for the plight of all women, equality of all genders. <br /> <br /> Perfect in everything, always with her two loyal friends, Nicole, the silly goofy, who obviously has a lot of Daddy's money, and the tough girl, Dana, who has proven to be a hard bone of to gnaw Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that I blame it. But horror of the horrors, comes Lola, who considers herself the greatest actress since Natalie Wood, with green feathers in her hair and false tan. She's even smarter than Zoey herself, if that's possible, and even dumber than Nicole, and hell, we know this can not be possible. <br /> <br /> This program, like all television apologies programs that Nickelodeon has been pouring since the 2000s, is one of the main victims of stereotypes. Take the girl next door and be dense with the feelings of your best friend for her Zoey, a great though inarticulate sometimes best friend of girls, Chase, a cool and arrogant woman, Logan, a boy and crazy clothes, who do not is very bright, Nicole The only one that everyone finds strange is because she is extremely smart, the nerd, Quinn, the super-dramatic, annoying, but super slim, the perfect image model of Malibu, Lola, and the woman hard and soft inside, Dana. Now, where have I heard these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's so wrong about having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about science, and really cares about her future and is doing well on the academic side, where the rest should worry too, is she "weird" and "nerd"? Lola at the beginning of the show, proved to be a potential great character with her daring ways and different perspectives in life, Zoey just had to go, pick up her forks, burn her at the stake, she's coming back to Weird Town and all that jazz. So much for the rights of women. Unfortunately, Lola has only become one more clone of the OC, in all its anorexic glory. Probably not to dazzle your lover. <br /> <br /> But hey, the 2000 generation of MySpace prostitutes seems to love Chase / Zoey's typical fairy tale novel, the tension between uncompromising, "hot" Logan and "Zoey or Dana, whatever your taste, and beautiful people. Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, superficial and tasteless way of life. Sorry to dismember you, my dear, this will not happen unless you have an important trust fund and parents to protect you.
