The plot's implausibility was noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of problems that Father McKenna would have had to go, and the enormous impossibility of some of the calculations he would have to have made, including that Langdon would decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; A few seconds later, he is issuing orders and, a few minutes later, he is running (literally) to take care of the operations - in real life he would be in shock. And as usual in thrillers, the killer does not kill the heroes, giving as his only weak explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as if all the innocent bystanders he fired were. I've always used Independence Day as the mark of a really horrible movie (the US president commands the jet plane and alien defeat, ha ha), and that effort comes close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who has not laughed consciously when the killer went to get his reward in Volkswagen? I felt like screaming, "You're going to be blown up." Who did not know that the heroine would find a body in the laboratory? Who has not seen the wicked? Technically, too, the movie was horrible. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while Rome's races to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. In addition, many scenes looked like mud. The only rewarding feature was the firing of Rome and what appeared to be the Vatican - an achievement, for I am sure that the Vatican authorities did not want that slag thrown in and around St. Peter's - and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.
