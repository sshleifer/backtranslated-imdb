One and Travolta were very good together, but - sadly - when they came off the screen, the film was a lot of boring and complicated side characters, wrapped in extremely bad writing. Occasional glimpses of grandeur like the dance scene between Uma and Travolta quickly eroded when Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting bandits appeared. And the white guy who tried to act black was VERY, VERY tiring after a lot of exposure in the photo. He weighed a pretty good performance for Rock, the only minor character you could not wait to see get off the screen. Bad and stupid plot. The writers clearly could not figure out whether they were writing for Generation X or the rap group for 12 to 15 years, and the combination turned into a movie that kept me looking at my watch!
