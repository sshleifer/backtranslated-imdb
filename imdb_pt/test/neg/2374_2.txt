I always said that there is nothing to beat the original form: the comics. I have proven right again. This, like every other film takes on the Asterix series, failed to impress. The creators of this film do not understand that what all other comics do that have turned into movies (x-men, superman et al.) Do well that they all deviate from the original versions of the comics and adapt it to make them, the most assistible. Accordingly, this film deviated in the sense that this film was a cross between two Asterix books, viz. Asterix and Great Crossing & Asterix and the Normans. In addition, not characteristic of the Asterix series (save Asterix and the Secret Weapon), a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced. All this ended up doing was creating a childishly immature plot. The funny parts were very few and far between. All in all, a total waste of time and money watching this, much less in theaters, even at home.
