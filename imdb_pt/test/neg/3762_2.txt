I purchased "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in a package with "Destination Moon". Now I see why distributors have done this: no one who has ever seen this movie would buy on their own. <br /> <br /> I can not understand which school system turned out to be the critic who stated that RXM is "great." your predictions of how space travel would happen ... "Throw yourself up, and then make a 90-degree turn to the right and rotate faster and faster until you reach escape velocity ... I do not think I'm Remember that the Apollo program does not matter that astronauts should lose weight when they turn off the engines, gravity changes direction every time they go through the hatch to the engine room. and if you want to put life on Mars, given the state of the planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a problem, it's just a leap-and-hop (with a helping hand of divine providence) and you're on Mars! convention pardonable in the name of the narrative, but can you make them look like at least a LITTLE alien? These Martians seemed extras from the cast of "10,000 BC" I can accept some scientific errors but that would not be approved by a second grader above of the average. <br /> <br /> And iss It's beyond the weft holes: 12 minutes before launch (as you are constantly reminded by the annoying PA voice saying "X minus so many minutes") the astronauts are giving a press conference! I think the crisis of time is the reason why Dr. Eckstrom did not change his coat and tie before going into space. And how convenient it is that even though they're planning to go to the moon and have pressure gear for it, they'd bring hiking gear (and rifles!) In case they ended up on Mars. They are lucky to have landed anywhere, since apparently the method they developed to land was to have Dr.E look out the window and tell the "pilot" (Lloyd Bridges) to adjust the levers from time to time. Note to XM-2 designers: How about giving the pilot a window seat? <br /> <br /> Said the previous comments about the casual sexism that caused the Lisa drachma (Osa Massen) to condemn them all repeatedly, erring their calculations of fuel, but hey that was the beginning of the fifties. was there to fill her sweater, not a useful function. "Rocketship XM" is notable for being one of the first of the first films to say "ohmigod, let's all blow ourselves up with these one atomic bombs here," but it can be noted that about it without wasting 77 minutes watching such dreck. By the way, that message might have had a little more impact if there were some money in the budget for actual sets of the ruins of the Martian city, instead of just matte paintings. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate "good" a bad science fiction, by the unique way that the "future" used to seem, and by the inherent (if condescending) humor you may encounter when we look at the naivety of the public there 60, but this movie must have been insulting even then. "Rocketship X-M" is not suitable for an MST3K style. Sometimes the bad is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Does anyone want to buy a DVD? Used only once, I swear.
