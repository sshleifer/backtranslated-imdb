a really horrible movie about a 30-foot-long shark. bad story, bad discussions, bad characters, bad plot, even a confusing ending, a complete. A waist of time in my point of view I thought it was a TV movie but then I saw that it was not I can not imagine having paid to see this crap crap, please avoid this movie at any cost. even if you like jaws, which I did in a mediocre way, I do not see that even if you have an interest in paleontology, do not even see that you like raw movies with cute actors, cheesy frames during TV hours, please do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a science fiction animal thriller yet, some people gave it ten statements ... I do not know if they were serious or not (but honestly they hope they do not) were)
