'Carolina Moon' is an appropriate movie made for TV about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the city where she grew up and where her best childhood friend was murdered. It turns out that every year on the same date another young woman is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female protagonist and does a good job with her, cleverly supported by the delightful Oliver Hudsom and the still luminous Jacqueline Bisset. The script, adapted from a novel by Nora Roberts, is a vulgar standard and the plot is tediously predictable. This, however, is compensated again, as I said, by the delightful Oliver Hudson.
