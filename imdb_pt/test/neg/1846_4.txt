Whoever wrote the script for this film obviously never consulted any book about Lucille Ball, especially his autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, from his early years in Celoron and Jamestown to his later years with Desi. I could write a complete list of factual errors, but it would continue through pages. In all, I believe Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply can not be portrayed by anyone but themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr., I would be angry at how many mistakes were made in this movie. The filmmakers have tried hard, but the film seems terribly sloppy for me.
