When I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it might be a bit good. but not. was an OK movie, not good, but not bad for most, but you come to the end and lose all credibility. they should have just left so dead. they did not leave the last bit, it did not make the slightest sense. if they had something in the beginning about a plane crash, yes, but we did not, so it did not work. The first bit is OK and I give them credit for it but the rest is just plain bad and unnecessary if you are planning on going and watching this movie DON "T is horrible to go and rent something that is really worth watching. 2/10
