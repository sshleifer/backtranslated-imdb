Uncle Buck, played by John (Candy), visits his family members for a week to take care of two gorgeous boys (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and handsome but snobby teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). The antics begin when Buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep on a bed two sizes too small for his one-body balloon. <br /> <br /> Almost bland, but peppered with two or three funny scenes, including Buck trying to talk on the phone with his angry girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and his encounter with a very disgusting clown. <br /> <br /> Candy looks like it weighs 600 pounds.
