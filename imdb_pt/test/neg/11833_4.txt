Films on the mundane are often the most interesting of all movies for me, in the hands of an insightful artist who examines every small detail of the mundane. French cinema seems to be very good at this kind of thing, and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was about the mundane. There is not much plot. It was just characters who lived in a city, very normal people, and things just happened. But it was not very interesting, and it was not examined with much perspicacity. The film captured a bit of humor, but it was not a particularly captivating mood. And while I can not think too hard that the movie did something wrong, it failed on almost every level to do anything right. There were many characters in this movie. Many of them looked the same, so it was hard to figure out who was who and what their relationships were. I do not mind struggling to understand a movie, or even watching a particularly complex movie more than once to sort out the details, but this was a puzzle that was not worth it to me. <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the cinematography was enjoyable - functional, not brilliant, but enjoyable. The camera often captured some cool postcard photos. But he rarely found the little details really interesting. <br /> <br /> I've seen a handful of not-so-good movies so far at the Seattle International Film Festival, but this was the only one that got no clap when the credits rolled. I felt a great sigh of relief when the movie finally came to an end. But I suppose there are probably some people who would like that. <br /> <br /> 4/10
