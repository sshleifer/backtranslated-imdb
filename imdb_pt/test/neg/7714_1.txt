When one of the stars in a movie is called Sticky Fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. To stay away. HOUSE 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies invading a college campus (man, like this must have been saved with money). As usual, the "zombies" receive no guidance, and provide very little makeup or costumes. They look like the zombies in one of those endless Italian zombies from years ago. Which is to say, they do not look like the kind of zombies we know and love from the zombie movies of George Romero and Dan O'Bannon. The people who fight against the zombies are all non-actors who manage to shoot guns and do little more. Some who wrote here think the sequence is a bit more focused than the original. All I have to say is that I'm glad that the director of the sequel deleted the 360-degree photos that helped ruin the first film. HOUSE 2 is still just more of the same, meaning that nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. There is a play, involving soldiers fighting with a zombie football team, which could at least have been funny. It is not.
