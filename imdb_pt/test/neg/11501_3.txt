This is a good show to watch, not the best nor the worst. I watched for a long time and I do not like any of the new things. This show has turned into teen trash and is living in a very different way. I do not like this crap .. I do not have IQ because they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really enjoyable to watch and was partly fun. The second season is just out of this world dumb. I really do not know why the writers / directors changed this show. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. I'm just going to watch the first season of this show from now on, whenever I see a new episode, I change the f * ckin channel ... you heard me! You get a 3/10 because I enjoyed a little of the first season but hated the second and third
