ATTENTION: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> During your distinguished career, you have made a great variety of entertainment, some good, some notsogood. "Night of the Blood Beast" falls into the last category. It's not as inflexible as saying "The Phantom of 10,000 Leagues" or, perhaps, "The Horror of Dunwich." However, one of my biggest criticisms of this movie is that I could have done it for you faster, better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the front and titles. Roger, the rocket sequences look like something from Disney's "Man Into Space", not so good, of course. The futuristic rocket looks nothing like 1958 contemporary. Why did not you just use a Vanguard launch, Atlas or even a Viking launch? Better yet, why not dispense entirely with the launch and start with a space outlet and the capsule floating on it? That's what I would have done for you, Roger. Secondly, why did the spacecraft hit the re-entry? Even a high school physics student might have told him that his astronaut would have come to the planet even more crunchy and largely boned. I would have shown your astronaut becoming "possessed" by the monster (perhaps using that great "negative / positive" thing you used in "Satellite War"), losing touch with the earth and landing in the desert. It would also explain how you "blooded animal" could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of re-entry, but still be destroyed by fire. Even with these nonsense. The first half of your movie is very good. If you had spent some money on decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "Outer Limits." But again, his writer describes Ed Nelson as the designer of the landing system, then gives him some stupid dialogue about magnetism. The biggest problem with the second half of "Night of the Blood Beast" is Michael Emmett. He is terrible as the condemned astronaut. You should have fired him and replaced him with Ed Nelson. You could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with John Dunlap's and spared the cost of an actor. I do not know if you actually paid any of these people; but at least you would save the cost of serving three meals a day. I had also given up the fantasy of "burnt parrot" and spent the extra money using make-up so the astronaut would become the "blood beast." Maybe it was a little too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but it would have helped the rhythm of the second half immensely. If you're going to have a "blood beast", would not it be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know the title comes from the embryos in the astronaut's blood, but Kowalski could have done a much better job for you if he spilled some chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like black and white blood. What cost you, maybe two dollars? I would have used some closes too. For some reason, the insipid dialogue and bad acting do not seem so bad in the closes. Look at almost 70 TV series and you'll see what I mean. Oh, in closing, Roger, a note to your writer. You can not use a fluoroscope to show a poor asshole full of alien embryos when you DO NOT HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY. Remember, you fried the generator on the first reel? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, you could not afford a fake knife? You know, the kind where the blade goes to the cable. I had one of those when I was 9, which also happens to be the year "Night of the Blood Beast" was made. It cost, perhaps, two more dollars. I think I knew enough to make a better movie for you. I know I already know enough to do this. So Roger, if you decide to redo "The Blood Night Beast," or if you are looking for a writer / director to work with you on SOME OTHER PROJECT, I am your man. I'll work cheap because I'd really like to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> I give "Night of the Blood Beast" a "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you like watching kitschy movies like "Night of the Blood Beast", the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was of very good quality. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" along with many other horrific horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for about $ 6.
