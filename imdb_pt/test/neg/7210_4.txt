This sequel only in the name of the classic ROADHOUSE has a DEA agent (John Schaech) coming to the rescue of his uncle (Will Patton) when his uncle is beaten by a local drug gang led by that wooden Indian of an actor Jake Busey . The gang wants to take over the poor boy's bar for nefarious reasons. Patrick Swayze really misses here. Schaech is an indifferent and unconvincing actor as a cop who kicks ass. The fights here are intermittent and not as powerful or violent as the fights at ROADHOUSE. The end is equally weak. Some pretty women keep things afloat a bit. There's a fantastic fight between a type of Daisy Duke who shows up handy with fists and guns, and a nasty-looking baby from Busey who is practical with sharp instruments. There is also a girl in scantily clad clothing at the beginning, who is a Schaech agent, but unfortunately she never reappears in the movie. What a pity. She does a brief lap dance to Schaech that got my full attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 starts with a striptease scene that resembles what looks like a real strip club, a rare circumstance in any movie. The rest is nap time.
