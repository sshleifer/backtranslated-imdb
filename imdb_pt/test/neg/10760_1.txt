Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once featured a light, sarcastic touch with seductive material such as "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives," appears completely here. Not only is her direction inapt, but she has also misbehaved Sidney Sheldon's novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, munching on the scene, is a very smart cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to exhibit any life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about animating a bum script. Bland, busy and produced at low cost. NO STARS of ****
