Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni) end up in the line of unemployment when Dick's corporation works and is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find a job, the duo turns to crime to get them . out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a Jim Carrey fan. It's been a while since he made a direct comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was satisfactory. He has proven that he can make serious dramas, but comedy is his true element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves he still has it. Even though the movie was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. It was not as funny as I thought it would be. Worth seeing once, though, unlike most Carrey films, it does not have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script was weak, since this is the same face that made the 40 year old Virgin. Some of the jokes just fall and sometimes they seem to be trying too hard. If Jim Carrey was not in it, the movie would have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She's a good actress, but she's not very funny. She did not mix well with Carrey and she seemed to be playing in her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The supporting cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he really gives a decent performance. He was not as annoying as most child stars. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm a bit prejudiced here. The movie was pretty common, but I liked it more because of Jim Carrey's performance. Jim Carrey fans should have fun, but that's all. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not very memorable. Overall Rating
