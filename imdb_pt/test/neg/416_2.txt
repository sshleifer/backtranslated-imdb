Ron Howard and his "editors" just had a job to do ... Follow the book's directions that was "rich," "mysterious," "moving," and highly cinematic in its approach! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They have changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What remains is something that has no right to be called "Angels and Daemons"! <br /> <br /> I really love the book and I find it very difficult to see it being treated that way! <br /> <br /> I wonder what was Dan Brown's own opinion about "this" movie. <br /> <br /> I really do not have the patience to sit back and correct the 1,000,000 changes they made, it's useless .......
