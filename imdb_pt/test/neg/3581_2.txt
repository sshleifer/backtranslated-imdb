I do not know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. Since the remake "Body Snatchers" he seems to have lost. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best films of the 1990s: serious accusations of a decade that went awry. With films like "R Xmas" (whatever that means) and "New Rose Hotel" he seems determined to disgust and annoy his former supporters. This movie has no life in it. While he gets great performances from his actors in all his projects, the result of this mix of ideas simply does not fit. Whatever the point - that the new drug-dealer race is about the same as any other upper-middle class of the New Yawkuh - gets lost in the narcotic script and the boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at 4-Plex in downtown Los Angeles. In the lobby, while buying tickets, I was surprised and delighted to see him filled with a large group of racially mixed men and women. his twenty and thirty years. Then they started in the theater but it was the theater that was featuring "8 Mile" not "'R Xmas"! The theater that shows "'R Xmas' (keep in mind, this was opening night!) There were a total of 4 people watching this, me, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> Way to go, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
