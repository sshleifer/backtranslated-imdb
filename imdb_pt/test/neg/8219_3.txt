Of all the directors who have sat behind a camera, Wellman could break his heart faster than anyone else. Even Ford. But this is one of their worst. Even he seemed to know this, probably from the jejune treatment, not far above Bonanza or Big Valley. <br /> <br /> But there is a moment, typical of Wellman, who comes out of nowhere to shatter him, the death of Gable's Indian wife. She went to give water to her baby and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly. No warning. Anything. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths throughout the cinema. Particularly after investing an entire hour of love for the lady in what appeared to be a mellow western. Of course the treatment she does afterwards is loaded with Wellman's apparent indifference to the film. Even so, it's a reminder of the power he's always had at his best.
