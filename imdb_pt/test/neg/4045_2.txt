If you want to see how to ruin a movie, study this very closely. In fact, it's so bad that people should buy it just for that reason. Especially note how most of the scenes look like they were knocked out in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this movie on all levels. The overall impression is that someone has received a below-average screenplay, aspiring actors, a median director and absolutely no budget. With a formula like that, it just had to be condemned. <br /> <br /> I rented this time, and I swear I was stupid watching it. If you are humanitarian, buy this horrible and horrible movie, and burn it - UNWATCHED - as a favor to the world. It has no perceptible plot, bad acting, and then throws something about bad, ugly women just to really do away with the whole thing. I would suggest watching paint dry before that stupid waste of a tape! Seriously. The paint would be better. I wish I could give 10 negative stars.
