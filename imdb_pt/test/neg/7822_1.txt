I've never seen a movie that bothered me that much. It's a movie about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. This is not a funny movie. I must say the plot is horrible. I did not have the patience to watch, so I only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This movie is about a silly guy trying to connect with his tyrant boss's daughter. When he finally gets to talk to her, she asks him to go that night at her house to see her father's owl, and he thinks she invited him to go with her at a party and be at her house at 6 pm. He is very disappointed to discover that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend. After his father leaves the house leaving precise orders, taking care of the house and its beloved bird, appears a secretary, a renegade son and all type of thing NOT funny happens in the house. But he finally connects with his boss's daughter. TRUST ME THAT THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
