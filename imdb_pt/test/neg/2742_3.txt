This was quite inevitable. This movie borrows from "The Core" and the movie he borrowed, "Armageddon," and the movies he borrowed and so on. Except this time there's Luke Perry too. This cinematic version of the familiar plan to save the world involves super-earthquakes beginning in the Pacific Northwest and also extending the entire ring of fire. It soon determined that everyone on Earth could be doomed. So the military and some scientists build one of these high-tech drilling machines to get on Earth and fix things up (it would not be so much fun if they did not have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). There is even a line that tries to make the journey across the Earth sound more impressive than the journey to space (like that of "Armageddon"). It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the script is to paint by disaster movie numbers. There are fighting between scientists and military, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice for the good of all, and above all there are special effects (weak CGI). Not original and not so fun. This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
