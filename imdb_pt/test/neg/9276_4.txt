The final entry in the trilogy On The Buses shows the usual sellers in their business in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the scripts made him look poor by comparison, so nothing more was done. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's less than two minutes before we get to our first dose of sexism - a woman running on the bus finds her breasts falling off her dress for no reason. Still, at least it makes Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but what does not? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the whole movie laughing loudly with little or no provocation. You get the impression that they got wet seeing paint dry. <br /> <br /> As before, the only fun element is the genuinely fun Stephen Lewis, hilarious as Blakey. He is alone, though, with a tacky and dated script that even stirs up front-line talents like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. However, it seems that only Lewis understands how to time the unstable material, cackling even the weakest lines. Describing how her daughter fell into a river, Stan's mother laments "I hope it's not polluted." "Well, it will be now," Blakey jokes. <br /> <br /> The plot - if there is one - sees Stan wishing for a young girl, but being constantly frustrated by his domineering mother. It's a recipe for hilarity that I'm sure you'll agree, whether it's on a boat or in the swimming baths, the exploits of Stan and Mavis always produce the same result ... boring boredom. Later achievements include Maria, an Italian stereotype and a team contributor. Even Stan's mom has one night, with Stan reminding her to "put her tin boxes away." <br /> <br /> When one of the comic's "high points" is Arthur Mullard listening to Olive trying to locate a light switch in the dark ("I can not find him") and thinking that she's talking about sex, then you can see why this work reaches the higher levels of literary sophistication. In fact, why did not you get into the top 100 BFI movies is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Other cuttlefish periwinkles involve Olive (Anna Karen) breaking her glasses. I do not know what is more surprising, the predictability of the scheme or the underdeveloped payment. Olive, of short vision, follows a man of kilt until the gentlemen, thinking that he is a woman of skirt. The next shot sees her marching by Blakey and redirected to the women. And that's it. She then ends up in another man's bed and is expelled by his wife. And ... no, that's all there is to that scene, too. <br /> <br /> When Holiday on the Buses was last screened on British television, there was a collapse in the broadcast. In fact, it came as blessed relief.
