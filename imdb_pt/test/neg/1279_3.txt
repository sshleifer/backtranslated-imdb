Some people think of Sweden in a negative way: too tidy, too clean, too serious, over-organized, and too far-fetched. A people tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and heavy-handed compulsion. This need not be a problem for a filmmaker, as for example the late Bergman showed us what may be cinematographic possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not comment explicitly on this identity as such. Andersson, however, does the opposite: He only comments on this identity by dissecting his people to the bone: In his world Sweden is equivalent to hell on earth. But he does not take it further, and for me, this is not just art but just annotation. Despite the exceptional time it took to make this filmmaker have serious limitations, he clearly can not leave the scene. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous film Sånger de andra våningen / Songs from the Second Floor, there is also not much progress to be observed. The intention was that this was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience are not the best in the film. The same absurdity and minimalism also apply, there is the camera position of one shot and the (lack of) action in front of this shot. Yes, the stills are well made, some of the scenes really work and the coloring and positioning are incredible. But does that make an interesting movie? Thinking in a negative way, this is the cinema taking a step back. <br /> <br /> Andersson's history as a creator of commercials shines in the elaborate configuration, but I find his films as empty as commercials. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
