This movie was awful. He was very much centered around Eddie, Clark Griswald's brother-in-law. Eddie works a lot better when he makes good jokes, like "Christmas Break" and "Holiday". <br /> <br /> I do not really understand how a movie like this would be given the thumbs up. Now, do not get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I felt that this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. This movie leaves a lot to be desired and really needed some top name actors.
