Italians are undeniable masters at the questionable "art" of stealing and imitating films. What they do is have an innovative, lucrative and foreign concept, keep the storyline basic and just add lots of action, sleaze and political inaccuracy. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a supposedly famous film and rather difficult to overcome in terms of slop and controversy? Well, then, I think you simply disregard everything in terms of story-making or elegance and totally focuses on doing something that's practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful saga of slavery, "Mandingo," released a year earlier, but as producers were too lazy to think of a different title, you should expect nothing that remotely looks like a narrative depth . character designs, disturbing atmosphere, or instigating statements about cross cultural relations. "MandingA" is purely and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops over the last ten minutes, in other words, when you stopped caring a long time ago. The characters in this movie are a meeting of despicable bastards, which of course one must expect when you are dealing with rich and detestable white people who are planting in South America. The elderly and supremely despicable owner of the place is widower (who probably also won some "Mustache-of-the-Year" awards), which exploits and extends the slaves who work for him. Her lover, who if I understood correctly is also her cousin (?), Is a true bitch of a woman who likes to provoke discussions and leaves home to flee from night to day to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe, after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted runtime, the plot begins to develop. Does the handsome young man have sex with the bitchy woman sometimes (even in front of the slaves, supposedly to "show" how his owners do it?), But eventually he falls in love with the daughter of the cherub shepherd. His romantic preference obviously leaves the grumpy woman furious with rage, and she plot a horrible act of revenge that will change life on the plantation forever. Hey ?? I just realized that this brief description of the plot really makes "Mandinga" sound like an interesting movie! Well, it is NOT and I apologize if I announced someone's expectations. It's an incredibly annoying and hideous movie to fight, but if the themes appeal to you, then definitely check out the "Mandingo" mentioned above. Much more than a sick exploration, this film is a truly insightful portrayal of one of the darkest pages in human history and was also a properly produced film with real actors, good music, and stunning film locations. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
