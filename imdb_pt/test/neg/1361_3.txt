This film states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those who ignore it have shutters. One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if you accept this as true, the end of the A movie contests this by saying that there may be something good in tragic situations, or B) forget about it and use a cliche to make the audience feel high. <br /> <br /> That film metaphorically illuminates its protagonist, presenting it as a sympathetic character, despite any evidence for this sympathy showing contempt for the supporting characters who were the most attractive in the film. <br /> <br /> So what you get in this movie is a script that is not consistent in your theme and direction that does not bring the ending in sync with the rest of the movie. There are excellent performances given by all cast members, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It's a shame that they have not been backed by a better writer / director.
