This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who not only has the best years behind her, but also has a marked face that makes her look like a freak. But in Madrid, a teacher she knows has already performed some experiments on animals with a substance that regenerates cells. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because the teacher does not allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig, it kills and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a ruthless killer when it comes to keeping her secret a secret. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is a lot of fun, but Piero Vivarelli did not have enough skills and money to do it. a cool movie with that. In addition, the movie becomes boring after a good start and can not recover a fast pace, although the movie runtime does not exceed 83 minutes. And as the scenery shifts to the Swiss city of Geneva for the last third of the film, it sometimes even looks like a holiday movie when we see how beautiful the city of Geneva is (which it is - but it does not help carry the plot forward . So with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "Satanik" could become a shady Italian classic. But, as it is, it's just a boring, boring crime thriller that's not worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
