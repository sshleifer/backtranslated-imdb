I'm a big fan of science fiction movies. So when I saw this movie on EPG, I thought it was a nice evening. What a disappointment! Such a poor display of "special" effects that I could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you make special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real for a much lower price (I think)? And those killers "muppets" ... well, I could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect a low budget on a movie, but I do not think it's reasonable to have a movie down for any budget. As for the "star" of the film (I use many quotes tonight ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the guy is not even remotely an actor. Maybe he should have stayed in the martial arts movies. All in all, a horrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. A sincere 1 out of 10.
