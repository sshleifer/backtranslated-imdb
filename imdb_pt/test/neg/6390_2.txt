This movie has just arrived in Mexico and since I read very good comments here on this I decided to go see it with my friends and girlfriend but I was very disappointed, I do not understand how people can rate it 10/10 I want telling script and directing were beautiful, but a big movie in general needs a good story that was missing from this movie. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several Asian and European dramatic films but they have had a good story, watch this movie at your risk unless you are Eastern European or Orthodox I do not think you will like it. <br /> <br /> Half the people in the theater left including my 4 friends waiting outside since they were really bored so I was, but I always wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In relation to the film, it was extremely slow, with long wasting scenes, the full length of the story could have been shown in no more than 40 minutes, but they did more time by having scenes of the monk receiving coal that is like 15 minutes of the whole movie plus panoramic views and so on until they made a complete and really annoying movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you listen to me if you still watch him come back and rate this review as useful after the wings to help people avoid this waste of money.
