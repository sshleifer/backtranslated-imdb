The first farce really made money? This is another sequel (along the lines of ANOTHER STAKEOUT) that nobody asked for. But we get it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain dead. It's also very disgusting (remember the dinner scene). I think I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck, and Warden. Did they need the money so much?
