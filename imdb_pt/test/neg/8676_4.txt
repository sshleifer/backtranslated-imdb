Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try to take away the allure of the 1999 theatrical version (copied some of her ideas actually, in fact), but softened things a bit to make it more aligned with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather uninteresting and schizophrenic production. And, as with all other versions of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price's character is not where she is. Instead, there is a strange blond woman, discolored, running around, who never fully develops as a character. At least in the 1999 movie, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly established as a rebellious rebel who is too smart for his own good. This "Fanny Price" is a complete puzzle. Someday, I'd really like to see a dramatization of Mansfield Park that actually includes a representation of Fanny's character as she was written by Jane Austen. A sweet, gentle and compassionate girl with a shy personality and a fragile constitution. She is reserved so painfully honest but also strong in her convictions, infallibly loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkably astute. A little later, it is not until the eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from clumsy teenager to self-confident youngster. And she wants nothing more in life than to be of any real use to those she loves most. It's a wonderfully complex character that I look forward to seeing one faithfully portrayed day.
