"Submerged" is definitely not "the worst movie ever". It has its flaws, such as borrowed images, crazy scripts and nonexistent special effects (these are the worst ones), but it also has some good points. The acting is surprisingly good, there are MANY familiar faces you probably know if you are a fan of B movies like me. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes, know him mainly for his 80s action movies, and I must admit, he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson have a limited screen time, but are credible in their parts. The "sweet eyes" in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscles to the bottom like a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately, the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He does not act at all, he talks like he has not even read the screenplay, and being tough at the beginning of the movie, he is shot like an asshole an hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie - this is not a bad choice for evening entertainment. If you can get past the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single blow on anyone), Coolio's annoying performance, and the recycled images from Airport 77, you might like this without thinking after all.
