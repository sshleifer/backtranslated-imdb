The film's catchphrase is "You think you know who you are. You have no idea." I reject the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this movie tells me who the real people are. If people in real life are really like this, then dude, we're screwed. <br /> <br /> A bile film that I came in late and left prematurely. A movie that is so wrapped up in its goal to become the all-time racing movie that it loses sight of the very tools a movie should use. <br /> <br /> The rules of Hollywood are such: if you show something in the first half, it should be used in the second half. So the weapon that the daughter cares about buying her father will somehow find the way to the story in the second half. Hollywood's rules are to make dialogue "real" - a concept that changes every decade. Is this 'real dialogue' less ridiculous than Kevin Smith's 'real dialogue' ten years ago? Hollywood rules state that we define the scene, and as the action rises, the camera gets closer to the faces - in this film, in particular, so we can see the supposed shame, humiliation, and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame ratio slows and our heart is bound to break. <br /> <br /> This movie is as crassly manipulative as it is tasteless. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I admit freely, then, to counter this prejudice, I will not say that this is a natural situation arising from the location, but probably from the author and director. The writer, Paul Haggis, has already shown a taste for controversy over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring the best of a screenplay's ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera, it becomes obvious that he not only does not know how to write a natural and true human drama, but also does not know how to photograph or forward it. Paul Haggis comes from the land of TV, let's not forget: the land of diminished expectations. Everything is as obvious as a TV movie, simply presented to simple minds - Haggis intrigues us, and again, that although on the surface people may seem horrible, they have hidden pains hidden. This is a good idea, but so presumptuously presented that any juxtaposition of bad / good has an amateur feel. Structurally the film is broken, in the tradition of Magnolia and other previous films. The editing is as typical and conventionally "cinematic" as it could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door opening or a car passing between the subject and the camera, the editors use that extreme motion to give the cut occurring there. a more kinetic quality. The problem is that, beyond the will to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept by the books. Not only are the puppets of this horrific racial attack and judy show inept handled, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The film tries desperately to present reality, but there is no talent. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all the performance is confused, overturned by the low and low aesthetics of the film. We have a cinematography that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However, cinematography is not only not noteworthy, it is also the thoughtless camera work and framing that believe that it really is inspired. The result is little stylistic flourishes that we recognize, but which in fact add nothing to drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - as a parent holds his dying son (the father can be shot too, I did not stand around to find out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous range / zoom Vertigo. The vertigo shot !!! It was at this moment that the movie was hysterical and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and wanted to express to the audience that I was fed up with Hollywood 'art' with an empty face, full of sound and fury, but that meant nothing (in the bard's own words). I hate to waste such good references from Shakespeare on something so remarkably bad.
