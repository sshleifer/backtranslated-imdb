This movie had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but revealed incompetence on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore's presence on the cast list is usually a sign that the film will not be released. nothing more than mediocre, because Moore always has leading roles and he can not act. But this movie also had Ian Holm and Lee Marvin, and it was based on a Wilbur Smith book, so I thought I'd give it a go when I saw the DVD for sale in the bin ... It was a mistake . The opening scene seemed to start in the middle of a roll, with the sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the track had been truncated. The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a German crew. This bad edition was a sign of what was to come, but the dreadnought scene was interesting enough to keep me watching. The special effects were good, and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in German, indicating that the director at least paid attention to the historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I kept watching, and then Moore appeared and my assumptions were confirmed. Bad acting, cliché, cinematic cliché and cheap humor ... but worst of all, it's a disastrous attempt to blend the film's light feel with serious drama and tragedy. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> Does the movie end so suddenly and as badly as it started? in the middle of a reel.
