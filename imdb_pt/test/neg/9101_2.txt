This movie goes to great lengths to be an "action" movie, but fails miserably. <br /> Steve Guttenberg plays the head of an elite anti-terrorist team that fails (?) in an attempt to keep a mysterious group. of stealing a deadly nerve agent. <br /> <br /> The story ... the acting ... the special effects ... EVERYTHING LEFT !!! <br /> <br /> Definitely A MUST AVOID! !!!
