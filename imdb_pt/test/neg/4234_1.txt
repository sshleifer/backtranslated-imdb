European films may be slower and less tangled than American movies, but that goes a long way. It also shows a lot of incomplete characters drawn by doing unexplained things. It is not fantasy, nor is it surreal, it is just clumsy and bad. <br /> <br /> What's the message here? That people in France are thoughtful and look longingly long? What do they like to see other people having sex? Do they scream out spontaneously or do they touch a stranger on their neck? Do not wear a watch while watching this movie, as you will be amazed at the little that is explained or learned over large stretches of time. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply disturbed. for the brutal murder of a little girl, though in fact he seems disturbed before that. He is not only upset with his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally quite slow, behaving much like a six-year-old with learning disabilities. He stares intently, walks stiffly like a child, speaks tame, sympathetic, tones, behaves strangely in all his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care even when it is supposed to be a police business) . ). He's not a disturbed cop, he's more of an outpatient. Imagine Andy Kaufman's Latka character in Taxi, but without the humor. Not only is he not credible as a cop, he is not credible as an adult. That he won a prize for this interpretation of his character is truly incredible - unless he was playing the part exactly as it is written and it is the fault of the weirdoes who wrote this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see anything like what the police would do if a girl were found dead. This is not so important, although the implausibility of their behavior is a kind of insult. The problem is that the rest of the movie does not make sense either. This leaves the long and long fields, gardens, faces of people, etc. The ending seemed particularly ridiculous to me - totally devoid of the events that led to it - unless you think, "What's the worst way this movie could end?" <br /> <br /> There's a lot of sex and nudity, which means something. Do you want vaginas? You will see vaginas. Do not worry, it's art. It has a deep meaning, which I'm not sure. And the protagonist, despite his strange naivet√©, seems to have some kind of fetish in the neck or homoerotic fetus. <br /> <br /> Finally, the captions are blank and often appear on a white background - very difficult to read many of them. On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so this is not a big problem. There is also very little sound - not even ambient sounds you'd expect to hear - in the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. Old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work. <br /> <br /> That this is an award winning movie is sad. I'd hate to see the lost movies. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
