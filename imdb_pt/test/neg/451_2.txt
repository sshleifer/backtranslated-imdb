To be fair, I did not see much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I seem to remember them moving on the weekly schedule. Some shows are not worth the trouble of keeping up with every week. But I really tried in the beginning so it was not all bad. Maybe I kept hoping it would improve, but I can not give this show a 1. In all honesty, I can not give more than one 2. <br /> <br /> It was not MASH (I'm not going to type these stupid every time). And it was trying to be MASH without putting any effort, as if it would just magically happen. Well, guess what? No magic. The best I can do here is to compare it with other shows. <br /> <br /> The hunter John, M.D., was by far a much better show. However, they should have called him B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ, but nothing like John Trapper. Keep everything the same, just change his name and show name. Presto! After MASH was not the only sequel to completely bombard and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame continuation for All In The Family. He had no heart, no conflict, no depth? all the things that made All In The Family so memorable. In the same way, MASH was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of the war. Remove the war and you remove the unit for 99% of the mood. Potter can not yell at Klinger for wearing a dress because Klinger is not wearing a dress because he is not trying to get kicked out of the Army because he is already out of the Army because the war is over. (breathing) All the jokes were forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer, stand by and watch the show. <br /> <br /> And as I recall, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy just standing there unnaturally, staring at the audience like a trio of vaudeville artists. It was reminiscent of Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind the couch and talking to the audience, trying to make it look like they were having a natural conversation. They were not. And I felt even less natural after the MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random detail that I remember is that the people who did the MASH never received spin-off royalties. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was actually a spin-off of the movie MASH (which they owned) and not the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I think studio executives will do anything for a buck. Anything other than making a worthwhile sequence, of course.
