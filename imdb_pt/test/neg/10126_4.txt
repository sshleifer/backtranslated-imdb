For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that the first attempt of The X Files in a vampire episode should fit directly into her butt. 3 has always intrigued me and - at the risk of sounding like the terrible Hans Keller - I often wonder if I'm missing the point. The story looks like a jigsaw puzzle that has pieces that do not match the box, and the result is that you spend a nice night beside the fire trying to match the sky that is really the sea. This incomplete feeling remains, no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. I know this review puts me in danger of being dragged to Whitby by teenage vampires who will drink my blood while they listen to Busted, but that is a risk I am willing to accept. I've always been a werewolf man.
