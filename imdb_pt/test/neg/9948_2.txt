Two girls make friends. One tries to convince the other that she's a witch. The other is a pushover leaning toward the witch's will. The film drags on with the useless interaction between the two little girls, with many dramatic cuts while posing "shocking" questions. You know, the sweet kind that little children should not ask, like, "How do you make a deal with the devil"? Oooh ... creepy. <br /> <br /> In the end, the pushover is tired of being controlled by his witchy friend. His belief that his friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But the moment you arrive, you will not care at all. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this movie may have been scary for a very religious Mexican movie fan from the 60s, but it does not hold up as a charming relic. It just creeps. This is boring. It's useless. It is not to be observed. There are many here who have many good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other works and, of course, that common denominator they all say. about nonsense movies: "Oh, cinematography is wonderful!" These reviewers probably have a point. But for those who have encountered this film without prior knowledge, they do not care about their "photography", their "atmosphere" or their ... whatever else they have - for these viewers, then, who just want a * good movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, guys: <br /> <br /> Ignore it.
