From a handful of alternative titles in English, "The Sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate, as this is basically a shameless interpretation of William Friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced Linda Blair, 13. Stella Carnacina, only a few years, so she could show her ravishing naked body for free. I'm not sure what exactly Satan tries to accomplish here, but he seems to own exclusively the young girl to do sexual tricks with her! Poor Danila masturbates all the time and tries to seduce the priests and even her own father to have sex with her. The young woman is presented as a clever and ambitious student of theology, with a strange-looking boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving, though adulterous, parents. When she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renew, the ancient relic comes to life and nothing less than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Planet of the Vampires") begins to torment her. The long masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare scenes cover about three-quarters of the film, and finally director Mario Garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. This final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests really do nothing but say some vague prayers, but somehow Danila seems healed suddenly. There is not much blood, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate for each fault by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploration efforts of the seventies (why the hell are they referring to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But it's definitely not one of the best. If you like "The Exorcist" clones, I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Beyond the Door" and "The Antichrist".
