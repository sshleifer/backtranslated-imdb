Waste is just that, a waste of time. MTV is turning into TV movies nowadays. A friend of mine recommended this and I rented it, needless to say, I will not be pursuing any recommendations anytime soon. This movie shows the roller coaster of drug use. The problem is that you really do not care about any of the characters because of the lack of credibility and your own self-discipline. This film is in one word, annoying to watch, from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and rhythm. The 'digital' format attempts realism, but it seems to distract. If you want real reach on drug use, see Requiem for a Dream.
