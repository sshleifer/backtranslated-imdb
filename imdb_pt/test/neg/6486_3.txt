An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a movie together; talk about the furious cheekbones!). The soundtrack was also not terrible. <br /> <br /> But the acting - even that of professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon - was terrible, the direction worse (perhaps contributory to the first), dialogue like chimpanzee, and camera work, hardly tolerable . Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. I do not know where this was filmed, but if I take a guess, it would be an open-air museum, or one of those reenactment villages, where everything is a little well-guarded to do more things. than to suggest the "true Old West." Ok, so it was filmed on a college budget. Having said that, I could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned flaws. But taken together, and being generous, I could not see giving more than three stars.
