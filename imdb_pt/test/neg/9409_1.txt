For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in LA For any audience expecting a fair return on the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (for me) is that we're watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, apparently playing a parody of himself. This is what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for people in the film industry to work and thus earn a living. What I can not understand is an Al Pacino talent artist who prostitutes and is ashamed of this level of mindless junk. I hope he chooses better value projects in the future ... and for value, save your hard earned money and time. Skip this!! Let's send a message to Hollywood and Al.
