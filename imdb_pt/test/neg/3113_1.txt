I had to read "I know why caged birds sing in my English class and watch the movie after I finish it." After watching the movie, I regret to see. That took away all the impact of the book. The scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed that the screenwriter never picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes. I was outraged at the end of the movie. Almost half of the book was cut and certain aspects were extremely important to the growth of Maya as a person. If you have read ... Caged Birds, this movie will ruin the book experience, so I warn you not to see it.
