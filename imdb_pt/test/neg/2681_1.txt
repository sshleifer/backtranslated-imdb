Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving and the other hating. As for 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers', I fall into this last category. <br /> <br /> I am of the opinion that John Carpenter in 1978 made one of the best horror films of the decade, which despite its flaws, still holds up until the 21st century. It has reused many of the old horror movies, but used them in an original and effective way. He had no pretense that it was anything but a movie about a mental patient who escaped babysitters on Halloween night. And there were still "ideas" in the film, but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into his skull. He juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was happening in history and did it with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The 'filmmakers' of this 'movie' probably would not understand the previous paragraph. That's why we burden ourselves with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. Direction, script, acting are from the lowest strata imaginable. This is the kind of movie that is so tediously numbing and hint of nausea that makes you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It's also really sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence squandering his acting skills with that saliva pool of a movie. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned himself to the fact that this may be his last film. Maybe that's what killed him.
