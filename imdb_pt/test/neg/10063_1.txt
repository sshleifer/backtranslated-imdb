Producers Golan and Globus should be ashamed to publicly disclose this piece of garbage. I know this will sound clich√©, but compared to that, the first "Hercules" of 1983 seems like a ripe and exciting epic! This "sequel" is stupid, cheap, irredeemable, childish, false, inappropriate and malicious. A bad movie milestone, and one of the few, few movies I've seen that really deserve the lowest rating possible: no stars!
