I vomited officially in my own mouth, thanks to this movie. <br /> <br /> I expected the absolute worst with this movie, but I expected an absolute worse moving and pleasurable. This is just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible as Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: the Ewoks are speaking English. It's awful. <br /> <br /> The villain girl looks like she has traveled from the future set of Power Rangers. I really want her to get off the ground and say, "Finally! After ten thousand years I'm free! It's time to conquer Earth!" The putty ... er, I mean the great evil, no matter what they are ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even weaker version of the Cryptkeeper. The Cryptkeeper was cool, but these guys were not. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film was Paul Gleason. This movie could have been better if it had gone to the bad guys and said "If I have to go in here again, I'm breaking skulls". It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks had been played by Judd Nelson, who uttered his words in saying this. <br /> <br /> In addition, that little fast creature is very tough. Word for it. <br /> <br /> No word for the movie, though. I want to give this movie a two. I want it so bad. There is a passage I have memorized: the path of this film is surrounded on all sides by the inequities of terribility and the tyranny of derived horror. Blessed is nothing because this movie explodes.
