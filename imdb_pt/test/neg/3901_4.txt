Do not be fooled by other reviewers. While this film contains an impressive array of talents, the material they feature leaves a lot to be desired. The three numbers of Nat King Cole are very lame and do not even come close to his later efforts, although he impresses with his piano playing. 'Moms' Mabley is not at all funny, though I remember her as a very entertaining talk show host from my youth. In fact, the best performances are of a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap and take off of the Four Tops, and the jazz band itself, especially in the number that counts with the bass player. The print itself is of poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is totally wasted on the surrounding storyline.
