From the fertile imagination brought to him by the irresistible HERCULES (1983), comes his even more absurd sequel: right from the start, we have another implant "time of time" heavy that even contradicts to completely contradict those same events. created in the first movie! a condensed set of highlights is soon followed by a sequence of SUPERMAN scrolling credits. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal seven of all the important (but badly animated) rays of Zeus? a crime that, on the one hand, puts the moon on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you might say "nepotism," Zeus (again interpreted as a white-bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion? who now legitimately took his place among the elite thanks to, it is assumed, the all-powerful tasks performed in the first film? to find their flourishing rays and avoid the calamities in the store. <br /> <br /> So that Hercules (Lou Ferrigno? as if you did not know) touched the earth's surface that he comes into contact with two attractive maidens (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) needing him to take them out of distress! ; the first (who would eventually become an Italian TV personality) apparently has the ability to talk to the small people (!) ?? who seem strangely like the little sisters of GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964) !! Just so they can cheat as much of the first film's unused material as possible, the divine villain quartet will resurrect good old King Minos (William Berger again) from his skeletal sleep and set him against his eternal enemy. Normally, is Hercules made to find a number of potentially deadly enemies, including a Gorgon? a terribly ill-produced sequence that should have led to an infallible plagiarism process if the filmmakers behind the much higher CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) bothered to watch this film (complete with the same "reflection in a shield") . preceded by the muscleman leaving the audience in his tactics before executing them as if he wanted to show us how clever he is) !! And just to make it clear that he uses his influences on his sleeve, Cozzi makes Hercules and Minos transform into a cosmic version of "King Kong vs. Godzilla" for one of his battles, and later King Kong faces a great snake, a date taken straight from the classic 1933 original. I swear: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As was the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliables like Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a wizard with a really bad hair day) and up- Starlets and coming? not only Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Ivy!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily surpasses her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, the score of Pino Donaggio for this is recycled from the music tracks featured in his soundtrack to the previous film. If you have stayed with this review so far, you may have realized that this is one of those movies that is so incredibly bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either discard in an unfavorable sentence or spend undeserved time dissecting their flaws. I'm sure I left out some of his ineptness, but I would not forgive myself if I did not mention the only example of loud laughter in the whole movie that nearly knocked me out of the chair (yes, even surpassed the above-mentioned animated titanic duel for me ), ie the decoration of the den of the rebellious gods which is in the form of a marble giant ?? kettle !! <br /> <br /> At this stage, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not totally unjustified) BOMB; in the past, have I had several lengthy online discussions about whether the star rating of any particular movie should reflect the overall artistic quality or its pure entertainment value? but these are two cases in which I thought it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in the final decision. I do not know: maybe it's because I'm in a "sword and sandal" mood at the moment (with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the next few days!), But, after all, not characteristically for me to decide add these two movies to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent review? and that's all you have to count for something, right?
