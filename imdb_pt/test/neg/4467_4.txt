Being a long time fan of Steve Martin, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliche script. The screenwriter must have just rented a few videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it's certainly about the least imaginative movie I've seen in a long time - I knew exactly what would happen in each scene as soon as it started. Afro-American stereotypes and slave references are also very offensive. But the thing that was worse for me was seeing Martin in a movie with no trace of humor. He's probably one of the smarter actors and here he sold himself totally for a totally idiotic script. He must be behind his pension to be in such a lame endeavor.
