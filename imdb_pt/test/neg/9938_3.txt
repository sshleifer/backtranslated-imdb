Wow!! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at two in the morning at Cinemax for all those insomniacs (Lord knows they would probably faint from boredom by watching this movie) Terrible acting, the killer is far from scary, I've seen clowns in carnivals that were more frightening. Lots of unnecessary 'skin' in this movie, pseudo-porn scenes that are horrible in over a million, a soap opera script that really hurt the movie and the director really did not have talent for the genre he was trying to create with this movie. I could see a group of teenagers with their daughters of parents doing a better job than that. I do not think there's a part of me that can recommend this movie to anyone ...
