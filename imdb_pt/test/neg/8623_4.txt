George Sluizer's remake of his own top film is a complete waste of time. Why have you even been tempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has only a small amount of time on screen) is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now Barney is portrayed as the kind of person no one would trust a month on Sundays - he plays like Frankenstein's Monster but without sympathy, and Bridges's acting is totally horrible. Sutherland seems a little better when her character becomes a detective with the help of a new love interest, Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is its obvious need for Hollywood audiences, avoiding the somber end of the original movie. Here the ending is happy, which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely destroys the story. However, at this point, the damage was done as Jeff Bridges turns the crook into a huge chuckle.
