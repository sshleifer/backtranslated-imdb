I've seen some of Pedro Almodovar's films, but this would have to be the most disappointing yet. This movie did not seem to have the pomp that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story simply never interested me. Many Almod√≥var goers appear in this film, so it's not as if there was a lack of talent on the screen, but this film seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comic edge to this movie, I certainly could not find it, and it made a surprisingly weak movie.
