Well, finally, a view of this film underestimated. But you can not find a good copy of it, a terrible copy filled with green drops, editing is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has that terrible squeal and sometimes you can even hear the camera recording. Overall it is very dark, a waist of time you should say, but it is not. It's a bit slow, the first half of the movie is talking and making love to each other. It's still strange that 60s movie girls never wear a bra. When they enter the bedroom is all the glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still in the list of nasties videos. The reason is simple, it's bloody for your time. It really has some nasty dismemberment and it is scary somehow due to the fact that it is filmed handycam mode. So every photo that the image is moving, things they do these days with the steadycam. The Ghastly Ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better, but still better than other films of the era, such as Schoolgirls In Chains.
