I had trouble sitting down with it. Each twist and twist is predictable. You're sitting there just waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes, there it is! Just like you predicted at the beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes outside. Et cetera. <br /> <br /> Smart writing? No. <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, there is no nudity. Other reviews calling this torture porn are probably written by people with heavy drugs. Unfortunately there is no torture or nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no suspense in this thriller. The only good part about this movie is the ending, but I will not ruin it. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 2/10. A 1/10 would be a horrible B movie. This movie had better acting.
