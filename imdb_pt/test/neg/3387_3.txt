Last night, I'm sitting in my TV room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the TV tray and I decide to put the movie "Monster Man" on my faithful VCR. Expecting a movie festival full of fun, bloody, crash & bash. What do I get instead? One of the most silly, stupid, irreverent and predictable movies I've ever had the dislike of sitting down. And what's even worse, all during (and I use that next phrase vaguely) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes! I'm going to make this short and sweet summary: mix "Dude, where's my car" (about a good 1/2 of the movie) with a very diluted "Hitcher", add a backwoods version of the "I Madman" antagonist as the main villain and finally some incoherent mumbo jumbo black magic and you kind of will understand how rotten this movie is. It is also totally predictable everywhere. The only notable factor for this comedy film disguised as a "horror movie" is that some of the moments between the two guys (although the "hero" is a boring geek and the other is a Jack Black clone) are kind of funny mediocre funny ie.like most SNL skits). Other than that, "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (This one I'm going to distribute at Halloween time - I just hope after the person to see it, I do not pick up my house or worse)
