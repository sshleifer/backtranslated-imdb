When Underdog, the cartoon debuted in 1964, at age 7, I was hooked immediately. He was Top Dog (pun intended) in my book (that is, until Batman debuted on ABC's a year or so later). Even when it became clear that Disney was going to make a live action version of Saturday's popular cartoon, it was equally clear to me that it would suck. Even reading the comments in the papers seemed to confirm this. However, I made a point of: a) never trying to write a comment, unless I have seen the film from beginning to end; and b) never spend a red penny on a movie that I'm almost sure will hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube I: a) I am fully qualified to write this review; and b) it cost me only 84 minutes of my sweaty time. <br /> <br /> It also proves my point, that is, that this movie is not merely crap. It's a steaming pile of dog droppings. It resembles the TV series only in the name, although it almost got hit with Simon and Cad. All in all, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately I did not. t have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * out of *****
