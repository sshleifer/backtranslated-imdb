As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him on the "Millennium" series) and, of course, Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I expected at least SOMETHING from this movie. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the acting is poor and the computer graphics used for most acrobatics does not work. Sometimes it looks like they've captured some photos of Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> Cinematography sucks too. At first, unnecessary camera work only harms (from the tacky dialogue) and gives the film an inexpensive, video-made look. It works on hip-hop movies and Jet Li movies, but it seems out of place in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was 11 then.
