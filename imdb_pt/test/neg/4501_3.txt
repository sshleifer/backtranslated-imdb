"Destroy All Planets" ends up content to "destroy all of Tokyo" at the end of the movie, when a giant squid-like space monster falls into the reptilian furnace known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera has been saving Earth from the start, knocking down the Varian # 1 Space Ship even before the first set of movie credits. The scene switches to a Japanese Boy Scout camp where we meet a pair of nosy young heroes, Jim and Masao, who participate in the exploits of Gamera after being abducted by the aliens and transported aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield. <br /> <It is very surprising to see the boys persuade a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that may be defective. Previously the boys' genius, Masao, had turned the unit on to work in the reverse direction of the controls, but Dr. Dobie did not think of checking this as a possibility. At least this set the boys to interfere in the controls of the alien spacecraft by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When the alien Viras says 'Enable Videotron', wait in their seats for rewriting them. filming previous films of Gamera, where he faces Barugon and Gyaos. These take up a bit of screen time, but they are no match for the fast forward button if you want to continue with it. For a long time, Viras addressed an invisible team, and when they finally showed up, they were Easterners who could fly - imagine that! Seeing how these films were made for a young audience, it's surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are. Blood of gamera drawing comes to mind, and how about the pair of space crew being beheaded. When the squid's tentacles began to emerge from the headless bodies, I made a connection with the films "Alien"; having the individual units merged to form the giant Viras was a legal device. <br /> <br /> I think the appeal to small children can reside in the identification with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, move quite freely in an alien spaceship, and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien telepathy technology. Seeing how the film was presumably done by adults, it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.
