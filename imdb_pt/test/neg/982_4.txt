To redo "Lost Horizon" as a musical, it was necessary to have a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe musical composition. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. That said, my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon" is your score. It's just that the punctuation does not fit the piece. The cast, composed mostly of non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, were all dubbed, and still does not sound so good). <br /> <br /> Frankly, the novel, in which this, and earlier versions of non-musical films were based, is mediocre at best. While there are possibilities for a truly good cinematic musical version, they are not performed here. The film can be a good vehicle for rain, to pass the time. Otherwise, it is better to buy the CD from the soundtrack. Just recommended as curiosity due to the film's terrible reputation. I've seen much better; but I've seen MUCH worse.
