"SHUT THE FRONT DOOR" That's what I said when I was told that Blockbuster had a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Okay, maybe it's not exactly what I said, but you got it. I did not need to know who was in the movie or anything else. All I knew was that I'm renting this movie. <br /> <br /> I probably should have asked about what it was. In retrospect, I do not know if I'd really like to watch a movie about a Mayan curse that makes a woman give birth to snakes and make them spit in the mouth. Nor would I want to see a movie that shows a guy who looks strangely like a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> Anyway, while the curse may be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still the promise that those annoying characters would be eaten or, at the very least, killed by snakes. So I was willing to sit for the first hour of very little more than a Texas Ranger forcing a girl to make a nice pussy palpable so she could keep her cocaine, or the Hispanic shaman who occasionally likes to stab people. But then, all hell broke loose, and the girl began to spit more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT So everything is going well in the end, and I am willing to ignore the fact that some of these snakes have suddenly turned out to be 25 feet long. After all, people are being eaten, so that's okay. But then all of a sudden, and I will not tell you how, because that would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. He then proceeds to squeeze and devour the train, with all Serpentaur graphic art from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I could not make a Nemesis Enforcer connection with this movie. Either way, you would think that such a snake, who ate a train, would be quite unstoppable. Well, not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from the sky. Yes, that's all I'm going to say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is bad. Too bad to get numb after watching it, or your brain can hurt. I did not give it to anyone, because no matter how stupid it was, it was not as bad as the dating movie. So, if you like badly built camp or B horror movies, this is the one for you. If you think this really will be cool as your biggest and most infamous siblings, just step back from the box if you see it. And I'll leave you with a quote from the movie that basically should sum it all up. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can not get on a train!" Because this is silly. Not like they make stops or anything ....
