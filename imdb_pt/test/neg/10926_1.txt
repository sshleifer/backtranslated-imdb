One of the commentators on the subject Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove), hit when he stated that the movie is very bad, but I do not accept when he / she commented on the animation. <br /> The animation was not bad because of Macromedia Flash. It was bad animation because it was misdirected. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can create animations as complete and fluid as any Disney movie, and in the wrong hands it may seem as bad as things on the internet, which is where Lil 'Pimp originated and should have stayed there. . <br /> <br /> Studios such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create wonderful animations using Flash (ie Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's House for Imaginary Friends, Mucha Lucha, etc.). Lil 'Pimp was an ill-conceived tripe piece that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the properties included. Roth and company thought they would make a quick buck exploring a dung like Lil 'Pimp and the farce was perpetuated by their producer, Amy Pell. The reason for this third-quarter miscarriage of an animated film is that none of the Revolution Studios executives had pragmatic minds to ward off Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they actually tried their best, but they were outnumbering them) and hired real writers . , directors and at least one semi-competent producer. They did the right thing though, they hired some of the best storyboarders, designers and animators in Los Angeles, but as Lil 'Pimp demonstrates, you can buy the best sports car on the floor but if you're an idiot, for sure.
