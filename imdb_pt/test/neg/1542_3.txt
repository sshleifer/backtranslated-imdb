There is something frustrating about watching a movie like "Murder By Numers" because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula there is a good movie trying to get out. However, the moment the credits roll, there is no way to save it. The whole thing is practically blown up by the "cop side" of the story, where the homicide detective characters of Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin are mixed up with a strange sexual affair that becomes increasingly trivialized the longer the film continues. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it is not enough to save the dull script and lazy rhythm. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted on a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year on the understated 'Birthday'), as does Chris Penn, who has such an ungrateful role that you're sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot is not even a factor in this movie. The two teen murderers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. His talent and chemistry work very well and perform very well. Too bad they were not in a much better movie. Barbet Schroeder is treading very safe ground here for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom line: it's worth renting if you're a fan of genres, but everyone will live a full life without ever having seen it except maybe on the TV network with convenient commercial breaks.
