This is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of movies. Me and my friends rented this one night wendsday. Dude, we had a lot of fun. This movie is the meanest boring crap I've ever seen. But that makes you laugh! You will lie on the floor rolling to try to breathe. Do you want to know why? Just rent it out and check out the girl who plays the keyboard at that despicable Russian bar. My mother would make a movie a thousand times better about her by feeding on cats.
