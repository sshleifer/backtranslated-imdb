*** BIG SPOILERS! *** "Flesh Feasth" from 1970 is more than an unworthy conclusion to the great career of Veronica Lake. This has the great reputation of being a horrible stinker, and rightly so, I must say. As a big fan of Horror / Low Budget exploration, especially from the 70's, I still chose to watch this, mainly due to the cool image of camping on this site, but after watching it I had to recognize that the photo really nothing to do with the movie. The image here on this site is the cover of a DVD collection entitled 'Flesh Feast' containing four films, including 'Mountain Of The Cannibal God' by Sergio Martino and 'I Eat Your Skin' by Dal Tenney. What the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not just a camp and ridiculous, but mostly a bit tedious, which is even more pathetic, since the film is only 70 minutes long. Also, do not be fooled by the title, the movie is not bloody anything. However, it is watchable, even if just by its clumsiness and especially by the extremely stupid end, but therefore somewhat fun. The film follows a ridiculous plot about Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of meat-eating worms (do not ask how). A gang of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever) who are paid by a radical political group designates the doctor to restore the youth of a "mysterious" commander. After an endless hour of nonsense, the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. It was pretty obvious before but I still had to start laughing because the end of the movie was so incredibly silly and without hilarious intent ... This is a movie that is very inappropriate as the last movie of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake. Except for the lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for zero-budget production like that. Bad performances, however, are something I can easily forgive in movies like this. What I can not forgive, however, is extreme boredom. The final five minutes make this possible for the most fanatical fans of the camp, but I would still recommend ignoring it.
