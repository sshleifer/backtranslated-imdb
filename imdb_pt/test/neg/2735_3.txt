This is a very VERY VERY bad movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the acting is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not convincing. Dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step of the way you can see coming a mile away. The ending is disappointing and there is no suspense. The best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason not to give a smaller vote is because it is a TV movie and I believe the budget was low to begin with. <BR> I believe that young fans of Luke Parry will still see this movie, but it did a better job. Again this is terrible. Very very very terrible. If you have a choice, see something else.
