It was poorly filmed. Sounds like an urgent job, the last-minute cast is obvious. Writing is very weak. Good for stage, not movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not been receiving good roles lately. This role was not for him. Maybe happy you've been caught yet. In the festival circuit this movie should stay.
