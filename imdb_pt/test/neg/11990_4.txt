There is only one reason why this movie is watchable. Until Schweiger. He is such a good actor that the movie is not quite terrible. Uwe Boll, please do another career. Special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (One night with ...) talked about Tim Burton who never read the Batman comics and showed. Uwe Boll must not have played video games on which he keeps making movies. If you two want to know how this is done, see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations of all time. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie, you'll see that the ID guys had a lot to do with Doom. It seems that no one at UBIsoft was anywhere near this production.
