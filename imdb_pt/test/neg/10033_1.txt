Thank God I did not buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of pure curiosity and of course, after seeing it, they should be repaid! This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I realize they could not have had a lot of budget but I swear I could make a movie better than this by looking at my pets! The acting was horrible, as was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it was seriously making me angry while I watched! I'm looking forward to the REAL movie about this story that will be released soon, so curious people do not have to lean to watch this joke!
