After reading so many brilliant accounts of 'To Serve Them All My Days' I went out and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to something in the same league as 'Brideshead Revisited' and some of the few other great British television productions, but that's not decidedly between them. <br /> <br /> The characters are too good to be true, wrapped in a very predictable plot and the most banal and showy script I've heard in years. Yes, there are their moments, but they are very thin on the floor. The lead actor is interesting, mainly because of his weird resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), just dark. But his undisputed talents are wasted on a character who is unbearably self-important and unassuming. His irritation is attributed to the effects of his experiments in the Somme during the First World War. He makes the first episodes, centered around his nervous condition, better than he doing the socialist favelador, noisy and clean later. <br /> <br /> Women are completely unbelievable, as in a real one. His first wife is annoyingly cheerful and cheerful, his girlfriend, the perfect sophisticated bitch, and the last lady a miscellany of political pride. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, named Hobarth, I forget the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The stubborn preaching of the script is typical of Andrew Davies, screenwriter. , in his early years, and becomes tiresome in the first two episodes (this mini-series has 11 episodes of duration!). In episode 4, I just wanted to get through the damn thing. <br /> <br /> The music is equally tedious, limited mainly to a piano melody and a chorus sung by boys during the credits. No expense has been spared in the location settings, which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I like stories of this kind in general, and I'm very disappointed in the sentimental nature of this series. . If you want to watch something fascinating about World War I and its after effects, there are many other finer vehicles to rent or buy. One that comes to mind is 'The Unknown Soldier' ​​from 1998. The characters in the presentation of the Masterpiece Theater are real and fascinating and move one, unlike the two-dimensional dolls in 'To Serve Them All My Days'. For boys' school movies, choose "Goodbye Mr Chips" or "Tom Brown's Schooldays". <br /> <br /> I know this goes against the general favorable view of this mini-series, but I strongly recommend thinking twice before spending $ 80.00 for Acorn Media for its set of 4 DVDs, 2 of which in the my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and jumping.
