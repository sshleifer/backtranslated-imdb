In a world where humans can live forever, you spend the whole movie wanting them to die. First, if you insist on watching this movie, do two things first, change the sound, do not worry if you miss a plot, hell they do not even talk for the first 70 minutes of an 87-minute movie, after you shut up you should now move quickly until the main girl dies, do not worry, even if you are paying attention, you will not know why or how she died. Once you get to the "good part", change it. Oh, as you'll know the good part, wait for an elevator scene with two idiots in space suits with World War II weapons. These weapons will not seem like much until you realize that the first protagonist had a laser gun and a cartridge of CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of a plot take place between a brilliant ball and a semi-hot girl who seems to have been attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "plot", you'll want them to not speak again. Of the four people in this movie, none of them can remotely act, not even a little bit, you will be luckier to attend a kindergarten theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the special in the special effects, let me say "Wow", you really will not spend the whole movie telling yourself "Where was the budget of 1.8 million dollars of this movie go ! " Seriously, that will leave you in a state of ineptitude. The best "sets" are basically wallpaper backgrounds of windows. Ships are basically flying saucers, expect some are boats that look like whales. I've never heard so many invented words in my entire life. They have buttons on the wrist (large pedometers) that can put them in "fight" mode and in super runing mode (makes them super erased). This will drain your energy reserves drastically, but they will find threads to chew to regain their strength. The explosions were less impressive than in my fourth of July, I only had stars. <br /> <br /> So the plot, as far as I can tell, is something like this "mother" is a spaceship captain and goes to the desert For a while, a rocket dies. So your 6000 year old daughter in the future (no, I'm not exaggerating) reminds you of your mother's memories through some kind of capsule. Either way they chatter for another 10 mins and then the cause is a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" that started our solar system. It's explained how it goes back in time or something, really no matter what happened, I guess. I believe the whole script was piously on a piece of paper, unless it really detailed any of the terrible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> After watching the credits, I laughed more than the entire movie, created jobs as catering supervisor "galactius sarcophagus" and then the special thanks to George Lucas was only the best. <br /> <br /> I really was not expecting so much for a movie that I paid 99 cents for but seriously some body owes me for it. More frequent comment heard after the movie "I want my life back". You have to admire that some, but put time and effort into this movie, but seriously, why?
