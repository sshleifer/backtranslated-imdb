I remember years ago, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to take part in a romantic movie because he thought his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does, but not in this movie. A colossal waste of time, without history, without development of character, without chemistry, nothing. This was not the vehicle we all hoped this movie would be, boring and a HUGE disappointment. You did not even watch the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen, move around, present a dish, but this was not the food network, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest fermenting, where was the chemistry . The poor guy on the second floor of his building trying all the tricks to connect and no character development there. The loss of her sister was misinterpreted as knowing that there was a closeness. Her sister's daughter was only thrown here and there with something that should lure him, NO. Just a waste of film time. The promoters certainly did the job of putting this flickerless movie on every network, tempting you with all sorts of sings. Sorry to say, do not waste a penny.
