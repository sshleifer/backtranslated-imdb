Tempest is based on the classic Shakespearean work of the same name, but bears little resemblance to the original material. <br /> <br /> He disguises himself as being as cerebral as his namesake, but instead is a confusing, complicated and banal. exercise in boredom. The original sounded the premise that people have an evil side, which would be destructive if not verified. Here you have just received a disillusioned ball from the middle life crisis (yawning) that is having everything wrong in your personal and professional life. He becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment; in other words: to get what you want. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something in his pathetic life goes wrong, he finds an isolated place and begins to babble "Show me the magic!" waving his hands and making an expression of "serious concentration." The way these scenes are filmed, it seems like he's trying to turn bugs into other types of bugs. Turning a spider into a cockroach maybe, but at this point, you really do not care. <br /> <br /> The story made him run away from his life with his daughter to a Greek island somewhere, then have an awkward relationship with a girl he knows, one of the dullest romances ever committed to filming. The story just fades and moves at a slower, slower pace. You never have any reason to like or dislike anyone. <br /> <br /> I will give a 2 because of the beautiful photos of Greek location and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it is unclear if the storm the power brought this end or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other films; One notable example is "Forbidden Planet," which gave credibility to how power spirals out of control. <br /> <br /> As for this "Storm", its only magic is to cure insomnia.
