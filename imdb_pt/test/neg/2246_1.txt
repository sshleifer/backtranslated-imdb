Hooray for Misspellings Title! After reading the reviews and contemplating, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is a piece of crap. This movie has lost her as one of those rare Tarantino fans. I wish it was made into nitrate film, and all the copies piled under a Tarantino fanboy smoking a chain. Literally unnecessary violence, plot holes, Tarantino's desk without drama, and the absent development of character made it a glorious and painful assembly. <br /> <br /> What was the performance? And how much of that was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my share of anime fans and praise for the authenticity attempt, but it was an exaggeration for an English movie. With the glaring historical flaws, constant reading killed what was acting there. <br /> <br /> Why pay money to a narrator who will have no draw with any of the characters, plot, themes, scenario or anything involved? in the movie? When the film needs that kind of explanation, it is foreshadowing the filth that follows. <br /> <br /> Historical Research - while sprinkled with interesting facts, used the appropriate costumes and props for the soldiers, this film extended the truth beyond belief, even to historical fiction. Congratulations on the reference to Mata Hari, although using it as harbinger was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad, not smothered in an isolated room. It ruined whatever sense the reference might have had. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen honors to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience, all these and other references were completely lost to many who would bother to see this film, and everyone who enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I'm confused by your choices when to start a scene. , and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action movie, why did it take nearly 20 minutes to ride any kind of testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I believe to be the message was banal. The idea of ​​rats and how we act in a primitive nature against them, and "who is the mouse?" At best it was cliché, but at worst not fulfilled. Mention of American camps for Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this issue to the high moral standard. Literally, every character in the movie who gets a talking role was caught in his own legend. Is this the world where Tarantino lives? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not pay to see this. I regret having bothered to see him, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none was realized.
