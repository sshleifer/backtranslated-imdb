A great waste of time is all that you will get out of this bag. I rented this one waiting for a suspense movie with maybe some believable scenes, but I was never disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101" or something along those lines. Well, anyway, stay well away from this movie. It dulls death. Do not be afraid of the big foot, be afraid of this crap !!
