Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in 1850 in Russia. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly christened movie, with June Foray making some of the voices. Unfortunately anyone who was ever supposed to synchronize the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the tabs of the lips. Anyone who says that Japanese movies are bad has never watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is instantly forgettable and so I forgot about it in the time the movie took to finish and for me to sit down and write it down. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that Reeves did in the hope of moving away from the action to a more movie-based plot type. It may have been a good thing for Reeves, but it's deadly to the public that has to go through festivals like this, where his whole court intrigues with very little action. In Reeves' defense, he was a good actor, he simply did not have much luck in choosing movies that were good. They all looked great, but very few of them did not put those who watched them into coma for the movie's runtime. <br /> <br /> This movie will put you in a coma. Watch only if you have the need to sleep and all other gentle means fail.
