What were they thinking when they made this movie truly terrible? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What led one to make this film, which explains his unique artistic vision, as the result of an (imaginary) case with a grotesque and charismatic abnormal (played by Downey)? <br /> <br /> In real life, Arbus broke a traditional marriage and the role of women to express themselves. In this film, Arbus is an ultra-somber Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a devotion of "Beauty and the Beast" to an interesting man. <br /> <br /> For this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. Regardless, it is also just doped and monotonous.
