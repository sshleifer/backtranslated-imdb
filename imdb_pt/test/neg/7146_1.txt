This movie infuriated me just because it was made just because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are clearly bad. What happened to the poor man was really horrible and a tragedy. Yet where was Hollywood when four white religious children were executed, after being forced to perform a series of sexual acts on their killers and with each other, by two evil blacks in Wichita just two years ago? Celebrities only harass the camera when it serves a political purpose. In addition, Laramie is portrayed in a dim light by this pseudo-documentary, which of course is not surprising because they are backward caipiras who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened Californians. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Laura Linney.
