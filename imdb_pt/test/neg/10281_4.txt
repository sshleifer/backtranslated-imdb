First of all, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake, I've always been. <br /> <br /> This movie came on Movieplex on the night of 10/13, and the title interested me and of course the star. But after watching it I was more confused than I was before I started ... There are some good scenes, and I thought they would take some place, but they did not happen, eventually becoming an "anti-police" "anti-buddy "" anti-hippie, "virtually" anti-everything film, "with an extremely confusing plot that also came to nothing. Robert Blake is great as the leader as well as as great as anyone could be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and I love his acting himself in such a crap as this ... But this drug induced the guts of the 70's, well ... better to stay away from that ... And that end, that pisser.
