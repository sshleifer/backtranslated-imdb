Well, I thought the movie was blah 1/10. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with the nerd or any girlfriend, this is the part that you guys are watching for Tho she had great hooters, I thought it's really a random actor No, it was not actually a model named Larissa McComas, but you already knew that <br /> <br /> So that made sense, but it was about the rest of the movie (which I saw anyway) did not call 4, and did not bother watching the rest of it <br /> <br /> All I needed to be satisfied with C so those of you who just take care of it right there you'll enjoy
