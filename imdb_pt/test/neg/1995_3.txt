After nearly being killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks, "Why can not I be a skunk? Then everyone would leave me alone." She looks around the junkyard and has an idea: white paint, black ink and a bit of Limburger cheese and a little garlic ... hmmmm. The next thing you know, we have the forerunner of "Pepe Le Pew", although in this cartoon, she is still a cat, she is she, and just a skunk in disguise. <br /> <br /> The cat is also taking advantage of and taking advantage of his new status as a stinking possum. He's a happy and happy guy now ... until a real skunk (with the imitation voice of Charles Boyer) shows up! <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the cat putting on a Biker's outfit. However, on the whole, I've never cared about these French characters taking off, finding the stereotypical dialogue exaggerated and not very funny, so I just classify it as "fair." I do this, however, by the moral at the end of the story.
