Another ridiculous and insensitive low-budget sci-fi TV show? but is it actually fun? more or less?? in a reasonably undemanding way. Am I being soft? I do not know why they come with these titles. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes, there is a snake. However, what is the problem with 'versus' in the middle? Of course they come to blows? in only two sequences (one recapitulating one incident and the other being the dishonest climax) and very boring exchanges that I could add. The presentation is the same old routine of a scientific experiment stepping out of control on an isolated island (no dinosaurs), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists hoping to expose tests on animals) are caught by it. This shows a komodo dragon and a snake becoming massive on the statue, with the government soon wishing to destroy any kind of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing up the island. So that leaves the survivors running up against time to find a way out. The prominent clips existed from horrible videogame CGI, hack script, some dirty sets (though the tropical island scenery was easy on the eyes), disposable characters (but I found the presentations fair), lifeless emotions (which for some reason kept using the same repetitive shot of the victim just standing there in terror, which implied that I'm waiting, please eat me now, I'm not going anywhere and eventually they were swallowed whole well almost as it always seemed take a second gulp to finish them off or just save the hassle by stupidly smashing them) and a very hysterical edge with some sort of unfortunate message among the survival acts. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be in control of cruise throughout. Michael Par√© revels in his rude dialogue and Michelle Borth added much needed sparks. Renee Talbert is there to do a lot, also successfully.
