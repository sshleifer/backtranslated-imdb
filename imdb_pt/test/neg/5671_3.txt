I'm not going to say the show is bad because there are some funny parts like Spencer and some random incidents. But besides, let's face it, it's just another comedy that kids are buying. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she's mediocre at ICarly and is not as funny as she tries to be. The actress who plays Sam seems to be half asleep most of the time, and her pranks are so clich√©d that I would think of them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is fine, but not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course the situations are not realistic, but not everything is bad. Some are uncomfortable, though. Here are a few: 1. Girls are 14 years old and have a web site that gives a lot of personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 (WTF), with little or no publicity, and they can still keep saying that their lives are not being attacked by crazy people. 2.Your web show gets too much praise ($ 100,000 a year to advertise sneakers, a free trip to Japan, the performance of White Plain Ts and so on). Honestly, anyone over 6 would not find their "comedy" fun. <br /> <br /> 3. How come they are so "average" but have a three-story loft, Spencer does almost nothing and still can buy many basic luxuries, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. All adults are idiots. ALL OF THEM. <br /> <br /> 5. No girl 5 feet tall, no matter how unsympathetic and tenacious, can knock down trained cops unless she is muscled. Sam is thin and delicate. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can fall 9 floors in an elevator and live. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can deal better with criminals than with police officers. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. It does look harmless, but make kids think they might be unpleasant for their elders, living alone in Seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible jerk, and giving out personal information is just plain wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3 years old, likes the show. What happened to cartoons when I was her age?
