and I have seen many movies. I saw this in the theater in 1989 and to this day I remember the unhealthy desire to leave. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the sanctity of the cinema - this movie has nothing to offer you. It's mostly a pathetic showcase for Belushi's biographer Bob Woodward. When we see the progression of Belushi's life on screen, Woodward appears in the film as a ghost character. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he barely utters "Breathe for me, Woodward." There are many terrible things to mention them all, the least of which is the opening that causes Belushi to jump out of his bag into the morgue and into a cab driven by a guy named "Angel." I'll leave it like this.
