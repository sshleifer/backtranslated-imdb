God, I hated this movie! I saw it in a preview 13 years ago, and I still have bad flashbacks. It was undoubtedly the worst movie I ever paid to see. It was poorly written, misdirected and (surprisingly considering the cast) acted poorly. I'd rather be thrown off a roof with sharp tips, and then have my skin ripped out, than sit back. Can you guess I did not like it?
