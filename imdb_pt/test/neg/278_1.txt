This was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( Sucks, because I was really looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> All the twists were crap They were all flashbacks !!! <br /> < what a good assault movie does is the BELIEVABILITY of the job Yes, it has to be amazing, so the audience gets stunned, but if you go away and go, this is bullshit, what's the point? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> all foolishness, including that fool of the French idiot to get past the lasers ... it's easy to do that when they're compounded later on! Plus, that sort of thing was already done in at least one other movie ... and it was stupid too. .. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is no reason to have up to half the 12 or 11 in this movie! <br /> <br /> What a difference half the cast really makes for the outcome of this movie? the scenes do not even have to be there! <br /> <br /> The first one was elegant. This was CHEAP! And that makes the whole team gain credibility. Especially Ocean himself for lowering Bennett.
