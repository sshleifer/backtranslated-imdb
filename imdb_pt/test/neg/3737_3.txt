First of all, I think the cast and acting were excellent. The problem is history. Basically there is no story here that is worth telling and therefore basically no movie here. Larry McMurtry did Lonesome Dove and can not blame the original, though he probably does not need strings. He did Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song I hear him sing is an old song by Buck Owens. The movie does a great business of raising chickens. Mellencamp's character has a good wife, and it's totally stupid of him to get away from her. The incident with riding on the sliding cage is totally stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some parts of the country, but I've never heard of it.
