Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with a monkey will cure his son (no - I'm not joking). He does the transplant and (somehow) his son changes from a fragile man to a muscular man with a coin store mask that (more or less) resembles a monkey! Of course he goes out, kills men, rips women's clothes and wreaks havoc. All this is cut short by the boring police romance. Arturo Martinez and fighter Lucy Ossorio. We also have meaningless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot. It all ends up copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (obviously) a very stupid movie. The plot makes little sense, there is free female nudity (a staple of any exploration film) and MUCH graphics that look ridiculously fake (except for open-heart transplants). Still, that has merit. The whole cast takes everything seriously and is not really as bad as the actors. Also dubbed the dialogue was (for a movie like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. I also saw a great print on DVD with strong, bright colors (which helps). We're not talking about a classic here, but an OK exploration movie.
