Great actors, good footage, a potentially interesting plot and what should have been a good dialogue. Nothing else is good about this movie. Maybe the writer or director thought they could make a thought-provoking movie out of annoying characters that are as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes I did not like Kim's interpretation of Caroleen Feeney so much that it became a distraction. While Kim is supposed to be an unfriendly character, I'm not sure if I should commit acts of physical violence on her. The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from "I'm losing $ 50.00" to "She stole $ 50" in about 3 seconds. It was completely implausible, since she (Kim) never had access to her wallet or was a pickpocket - there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people lost / misplaced money and just took it ... we lost it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character Kim was, at the very least, suffering from a bipolar disorder. Wes had huge problems of inadequacy, Nancy was annoying and Matt was delirious (particularly about music). I actually hung up about 2/3 of the way. However, in order to write a valid comment, I forced myself to turn it on again expecting something to fit into that movie. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make sure you miss this one.
