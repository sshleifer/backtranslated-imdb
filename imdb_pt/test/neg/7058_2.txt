When I was 13, I was lucky enough to find this movie. It was part of an endless series of really cheesy things. This however was the most tacky I ever had - but I think I sold it, too bad. Well, what to write ... Better than "Hands: the hands of fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was done by people who wanted to do this. The acting is not so terrible compared to many other junk eighties - in fact, I kind of like the old one, though it did not seem so Indian to me. But I do not think you can have it all ... Do yourself a favor and see this ...
