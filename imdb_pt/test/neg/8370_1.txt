it is a big problem that people can easily also make movies because of the cheap digital video cameras nowadays. I would generally appreciate that possibility, but if you see movies like that, it's a great shame. and it is also a great shame if people like h.p. Lovecraft is abused by the likes of that. I rented this "movie" because of the "hp. Lovecraft" drop in it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptations, especially those made by Brian Yuzna & Stuart Gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver! a cheap setting on a beach and in an old wine cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" throughout the film. no actors, just some low-quality idiot models who surely have no idea what they're doing, rigid like wood. and so must be the director. It is obvious that he tried to create an atmosphere. but as things are so laughable, it just does not work. and no bloody effects, just a little blood on a river (you drink = you become a devil) and falling here and there. oh yeah, the story: thousands of years ago, some "big and old" colonized the world and took humans as slaves. then mankind became independent, so the "old" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. the only chance to save mankind is to find NECRONOMICON, which is where he arrives at LOVECRAFT. then these soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beaches and in their cellar. Unbelievable - the whole thing! but as it is dubbed (German title: "Armee des Jenseits") and you can find it in most commercial video stores, it seems like you can make money with stuff like that. I find this impressive fact.
