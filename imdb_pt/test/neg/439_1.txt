Well, what can you say about a "horror comedy" that has neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but many plot lines - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous. <br /> <br /> Computer-generated creatures look bad, a bit like the Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail. The undead are the biggest robberies beyond the title, those who look like the dead in the Landis movie, but are far away. They just look like bad actors with a bit of plastic and ox blood added. <br /> <br /> Two plots really showed some promise (the love story and the "company" story), but they failed as miserably as the director, the writers, the SFX department, the production and the actors.
