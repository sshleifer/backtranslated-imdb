This movie is strange; you get the impression that the creators of this snooze-fest spent more time in the local bars than on the set. In fact, it's a surprise not to see the Harry Alan Towers name on the credits; certainly has the flavor of one of your tax shelter productions, but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for everyone involved to enjoy an extended stay in Provence. Despite the fact that the film must happen throughout the region, Les Baux and the area around it represent almost everything. <br /> <br /> David Birney makes a spectacularly colorless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking cliche". What Lonsdale is doing is what he imagines. For some reason, the more interesting character played by Rampling is cast aside, while, apart from the book, she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the ability to carry the film (which would have been annoying anyway , but at least we'd have something more beautiful to look at. All in all, a meaningless case that is worth watching to see how an action movie can be without action.
