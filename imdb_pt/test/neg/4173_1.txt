What can be said about this? Truly one of the most mind-boggling experiences of my life. Your brain will try to detach itself as part of a primordial impulse of self-preservation. I was devastated by the experience of watching this movie and it took me two good hours to recover completely. This film now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films. I certainly do not want to say that distinction in a good way. I mean that in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This movie has no redeeming features. Everything is terrible. The work of camera without art presents us infinitely the most ugly scenario imaginable, that is, a lot of corn, a lot of mud. The story is beyond stupid. The script is ??? Was there a script? The villain is severely unsuspecting and wears yellow high boots. Children are annoying. The main man is free of charisma. And you have the audacity to continue for 100 minutes. Totally devoid of merit on any level, this is similar to torture. Normally, such a statement would be an exaggeration intended for the comic effect. Not in this case. Am I really going to say it again? this is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. That was brief, thankfully. But as soon as I recovered, I decided I had to watch the 'Making Of' featurette. I had to understand. Perhaps there was a reasonable explanation for this atrocity. Was it all an elaborate joke? I watched the first 2 minutes of the 'Making Of' featurette and found that the writer / director was, to say the least, a bit wrong. I also discovered that because I had taken the time to watch the first two minutes of the 'Making Of' featurette from Dark Harvest 2 that I was an idiot. It is not a pleasant journey of self-discovery. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Highly not recommended.
