Firstly, I should point out that the role played by Wendell Corey was exceptional. Normally, Corey was relegated to supporting roles, but here's what helps to get this movie too weak. Without him and the character he played, the film would have been much worse - hardly deserving a 2 or 3. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my attacks is when the characters act "too stupid to live." You can not base the main points of the plot on the assumption that your main characters are completely stupid (unless having a brain injury is part of the plot, of course). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazed man who murdered three innocent people and knows that his next target is the wife of Joseph Cotten. So what do they do? Yes, they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all (no sniper and guys with shotguns that are so far away that probably will not stop this madman). And if that is not bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably flees from her hiding place and walks straight to the WORST place she can be! Someone who is such an idiot?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate it when the movies have such idiotic characters. In fact, I found myself cheering for Corey since I felt like idiots deserved to die for their behavior! In addition to these clichés characters, there was also a small player who fainted. Of course, seeing your husband shoot can cause someone to faint, however, in real life this is a rare occurrence - people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason. So combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism - something Film Noir movies should have. <br /> <br /> All these serious problems are even more infuriating, since the character of Wendell Corey is incredibly well written and conceived. It was his chance to shine as an actor - pity that the rest of the film was so weak that Corey and the basic idea of ​​the plot were sunk. This is a movie that could actually use a remake - but this time without brainless characters.
