"Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's Party Death!" Need I say more? The crazed scarecrow took four of ten stars out of me for a simple reason: apart from the terrible acting, holes, cheap special effects, and anti-climactic whistling, it was cinematic gold! I think this movie could have been really good if the scarecrow had become the baseball coach (as interpreted by the ever-so-brilliant Ken Shamrock). But again, they would have to cut off the special effects of electricity "Return of the Jedi". <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, my friends and I were convinced that, in fact, it had been written by one of the authors. our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. This movie has topless women, miserably fake gore, and dialogue who could not have spoken the output of a paper bag, or in this case, a cornfield. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the filmmaker something, that would be it; "How much did you have to pay the teenager who wrote it to you?"
