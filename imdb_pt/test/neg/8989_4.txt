I read many of the book readers 'hopes that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts' story. Not having read the book, I do not know if this adaptation was faithful, but I know it was not good. In fact, the screenplay was the best part of the film, which pleased Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She has been decent in some movies, average in others and very bad in this one. But Forlani was not alone. The performances were all over the place. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was a prey. So, in the midst of all this B-rate performance, there's Jacqueline Bisset! She did not have much to do but portray the bitterness, but even as she was sleepwalking, she was miles away from the others. <br /> <br /> Still, Forlani remains one of the most dazzling women in movies and I was not disappointed with this ability here. I believe Forlani may be more than a eye drop, but until she performs well on a good film, she continues to stand out in that. And I will continue to faithfully observe all that she participates. Fandom is fun that way. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, Carolina Moon, was very bad. Besides the bad acting (the false accents of the south are really disturbing) the direction was pedestrian. It was not awful. It was just the annoying gauge made for the TV you're used to seeing on Lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the stars, you probably might like Carolina Moon for that reason, as I did. If you are a fan of the book, you may like to see the story on the screen, albeit in an uninteresting way. Otherwise, this movie is not worth noting.
