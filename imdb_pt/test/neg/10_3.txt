Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the movie in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw a cheap DVD of this issue of Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards, I decided to buy and watch it once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a terrible movie. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start by describing where and when it goes so terribly wrong. Looking at this now, it is obvious to any movie fan that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had played gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, MUSIC SOUND, MILLIE TOTALLY MODERN, etc.) but also because Andrews was scorned for starring in projects made on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she was not sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillbirth effort, to show his wife in a bizarre blend of espionage story / war movie / romance / comedy / musical slapstick. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but as a whole, they simply do not work at all to the point of being too embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Remember, the DVD version is the "director cut". Edwards has cut 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) from the original swollen theatrical version to this more streamlined version. and still remarkably ineffective.The movie has no idea what it is.We are 25 minutes away and we still do not know what is happening or why we are seeing what is happening.What kind of spy is Lili How powerful is she? "I'm not going to tell you," Hudson said, "but I do not know if I'm going to be able to do it." Why should he and no other men with whom she was involved? There should have been one of her ex around, trying to regain her or trying to decipher her secret. given some impetuous to the slow process. There is no catalyst in this story. Just look at the scenes to see clearly that Edwards and the writer have just presented ideas inspired by Andrews '(and Edwards') successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene in which Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling music sound. No wonder he removed the DVD. In 1970, this scene could have worked at a certain level, but today, that moment reeks of despair. There are other plot elements directly inspired by the other Andrews / Edwards films. Endless scenes of dogfights are inspired by the very best MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment "I'll give you three guesses" was created just to make fun of Julie's character MARY POPPINS, who became "sassy" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The final, bird-like vision of Julie running toward Hudson's plane, is another "wink" at the sound of the song. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born of a German father and British mother, who lives in England, but sings her songs in English in Paris. You never know exactly where the story happens. Some moments are just poorly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly runs in the middle of the sentence. I'm like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> The pieces of comedy are bland and worthy of embarrassment. All the scenes with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her "uncle" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squad throws bullet shots on the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Bright. What's also funny about this scene is that the two get off on the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squad get on the train even as they fly the next morning. This is a slow train there. <br /> <br /> The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason I gave this movie to 3 stars), but the effect is diminished considerably because it is repeated at the end. Speaking of redundancy, do we really need to see a can dance, Crepe Suzette pickle scene, and Julie stripping too? The "Girl in no man's land" is fine, even if it's bleeding, but this moment simply does not make any sense because Lili sings to a group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were indirectly harmed by the result of his espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is apathetic and powerless. The novel is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is very old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks stunned, as if she's in the Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome that afflicted his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she's not Greta Garbo, who attracted her so well at MATA HARI. Funny, even though Julie is a German spy, she still seems boring and cute. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for his DVD release.
