Everyone has their choice for "worst movie they have ever seen". Some like to choose Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Since I was 14 years old I've been very vocal in saying this to me, it's Child Problem 2, and 9 years later, I feel exactly the same way. It is not "one of the worst", it is not just an expression. It's the worst real movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much farting, peeing, peeing and vomiting can you put in a single movie? I do not need to see a dog picking up trash that goes up to my waist! Why am I so hard on this dirt? I have nothing against the bathroom or the rude humor. Heck, I like American Pie movies. Having that excess within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the real turning point is to do it with the kids! Having little kids call each other sex names (IMDb will not even let me post that word here, it's still coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds now.) And urinating and vomiting on each other only does the thing every dirtier opinion. Worst line of the movie: "I guess I have to fart in the offices of more people." <br /> <br /> What other movie has: urinating in lemonade, banana dynamite exploding toilets, a little boy filming his nanny having sex and projecting on the side of the house, and a little girl playing with his testicles? <br /> <br /> However, my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same girl is on a carnival ride, says, "I'm going to vomit", opens his mouth, and pretending to look for vomit straight from his open mouth at a perfect 90 degree angle! The vomit scene in Scary Movie 2 looked more real than that. <br /> <br /> I suppose the only redeeming element of the film is Gilbert Gottfried. You have the impression that he did not even have a script, but he was just being habitual. Too bad he has to act stupid while the pizza is thrown on him. <br /> <br /> You know what? Thinking about the movie made me have to go to the bathroom. Bye!
