When I bought this movie, I expected to have a fun movie about the 1970s. Instead, I received this festival from amateur author Andy Milligan. Oh, Andy Milligan. With its tight editing, fast paced and wonderfully well-known actors, you almost think you're watching ... one of your home movies! Seriously, I could not even stay awake the first time I tried to watch it. The scenes of boring people crawled and, whenever someone was killed, the movie slowed down. Sometimes it also accelerated, making the characters' voices sound like squirrels, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The script really looked a little better than the movie, and seems more appropriate to be in a soap opera than in a sleepy 1970s pill where actors constantly stumble on their lines. The cover said: "His main cuts were curiously erotic ... but completely brutal!" Trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this movie. Oh, we get to see characters that look like uneven and extra cottage cheese, but that's all. And to the extent that "brutal", well, the viewer is more brutal with this movie here. And another thing ...
