I understood before watching this movie that it would be a low budget movie. But even with these low standards, this movie does not cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting, writing, directing, sound, music and editing. I hoped all this was bad, and it is. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it did not even do a good job in the guts and in the blood. Most of the 'action' takes place off-screen and all we can see are the after effects, which seem very fake - even by the low-cost movie standards. <br /> <br /> There's really no excuse for the blood being so poorly made. Peter Jackson made the equally low budget "Bad Taste" about the same time and he somehow managed to create more courage and courage than was shown in this film. <br /> <br /> A failure on almost every level, I can not recommend this movie to anyone. Avoid this. <br /> <br /> <br />
