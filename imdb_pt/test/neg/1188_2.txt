As a big fan of the three TV series, I was very interested to know that LoG was moving to the big screen. In my most honest moments, however, I had my doubts about the likely success of the concept, and whether writers would be able to sustain the high level of humor, comedy, and horror that infuse the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not unfounded, and the film was a big disappointment. I strive to understand the other reviews on this site. Obviously, people are entitled to their opinions, but the guys I've watched, everyone agrees with me, and they're as big fans as I am. <br /> <br /> The acting lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when they are not at their best, they are still highly watched. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There was some laughter, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. Worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the movies. So rarely have I felt so uninspired by a movie and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> I write this comment as a warning to other fans of the League - get a wide range of opinions on this film before going to see this. If you love League, you may be able to convince yourself that they have not totally ruined your move to the movies. If you can not convince yourself of this then you will have spotted in your mind the genius who otherwise is flawless and who exemplifies the TV series. <br /> <br /> LoG at the movies? More like log. (or brown goldfish).
