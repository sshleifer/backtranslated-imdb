I watched a performance of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. Although the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifying) positive, I must tell you, without any kind of problem, that this film is unimaginably indescribably bad. The very brave and heartfelt performances of William H. Macy and Maria Bello were terribly wrong about what is probably the least polished script and the most clich√©d script that has received the green light in years. I do not know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure it could not have hit the depths of Dante's style that it did. As brave as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing these brilliant actors did was surrender to such a dire director and an abysmal script. <br /> <br /> He should perform well in the boardroom because he was never allowed to be within hundred yards of a camera. The dialogue is so embarrassingly planned and awkward that I actually saw myself blushing during the performance. I am mortified that Macy's talents have been totally wasted in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing. Watching talented actors like Alec Baldwin toil through Kramer's shocking script It was like watching a baby seal be beaten to death - I felt angry, helpless and nauseous at the same time. While I am always happy that there are investors and people in the industry who are willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises, this image was a total and absolute fiasco. Kramer could not have been more cruel to these actors if he'd even brought a steel tube to his knees. I hope that, for them, everyone can avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy wisely leaned down the side door and did not even stand by the display. Regrettably, it seems that the bad luck of the protagonist has undressed the image in the worst possible way. Anyone accustomed to quality independents will probably find it totally unbearable.
