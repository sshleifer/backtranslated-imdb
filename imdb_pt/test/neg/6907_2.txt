I can not believe the number of people who refer to the main characters as 'boy cows' !! there is no such thing people !!!! There are cows and bulls and all males of the bovine species are bulls and have no udders !!!! There was even a real bull, but it was like it was another kind of animal altogether! My god this is how to draw human ears in a cat, breasts in superman, or mickey mouse with blond curls shirley temple - even in animation, it just does not work! giving human qualities to animals is nothing new and expected but changing their real bodies into a basically transsexual figure is bizarre for a cartoon familiar - how many people - editors, writers, producers, animators saw this and knew no better or did not say nothing - it's completely amazing! I'm not snobby & I luv animation - simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even ice age & all the new ones out there - over the fence was great - but this is crazy - totally crazy - I could not accept this that many people are so ignorant & I kept waiting for a reason for the udders in the movie - an explanation - none came - and in the end when they hold this little newborn calf and half of their belly is udder and they pronounce ' It's a boy I almost choked !!!! Please, writer / creator let us in on the joke!
