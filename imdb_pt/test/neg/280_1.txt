Ocean's 12 starts annoying and gets worse from there. Like a celebrity awards presentation, every major actor / actress is presented in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop only with a sign of "applaud now." The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited and sometimes completely unrelated and confusing. Speaking of history, ... there is one, half ... but it is barely visible to all "look at me" photos and apparitions. Only Matt Damon really seemed to "act" during this movie ... the rest of the cast seemed to be there just to attend a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As for the assault, the action, the drama ... was put in the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and it was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!
