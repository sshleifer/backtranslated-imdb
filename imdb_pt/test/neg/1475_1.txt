This was a boring and terrible film, even for a documentary. At times it provided insight into life and also had moments of humor, but overall was not worth seeing. Every time I began to feel sympathy for Mark and began to expect him to succeed, I was disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.
