Needful Things was one of my favorite Stephen King books. But this movie is one of the worst films to film adaptations that I've seen so many things have changed that made me sick. Even the concept of the book being misleading, not always the things that appear reminder throughout the book have not been shown in the film. Although the number of Stephen King films was fun, but like many Stephen King films, this one did not follow the book and became a piece of Hollywood trailer trash. 2/10
