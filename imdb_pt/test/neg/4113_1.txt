Dude, I was in this movie because of the great preview. It looked like it had a great story and good special effects. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. I wanted to leave the theater because of those horrible special effects. A cartoon dino, from the car's plate, would do an even better job than that. The story was all right if it had been accepted by a major film producer. Who would bring more money to make the effect more similar to life? The only thing I liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse where cars, in a scene 2 characters walk along the street. If you look at these cars, you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about 4x in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is the "death of the butterfly" that would determine "evolutionary changes" in progress. If that guy did not step on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten anyway! So this is absolute bull. So if you change anything in the past, the future will be different at the same instant. Not in those "waves of time" they did. But hey, if the future changed in a fraction of a second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic. This is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh. I spend a lot of money on this movie in the theater. And then they told me that this movie had a budget of $ 80 million. WHERE WAS ALL THE MONEY ????
