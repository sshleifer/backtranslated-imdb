I've watched this movie several times since it first came out. I was fifteen, and yet I knew it was cheesy. It had such great potential and I constantly rewrite the script in my head. Capoeira ruined what could have been a good drama. I loved the fact it was filmed locally. Too bad the characters were underdeveloped. It's as if they write a first draft of a screenplay and do the movie right away. At fifteen I could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogues seemed to come out of nowhere and you got lots of unanswered questions. And it was just me, or did it look like Wolf was sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena grew up in some kind of woman!" And the way he was always touching her. It would have an interesting twist, Elena working for her drug dealer cousin who is also perverted. Too bad they missed the mark.
