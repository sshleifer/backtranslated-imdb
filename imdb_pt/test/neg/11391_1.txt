This is a horrible reprint of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine in that one (Sinise? Bates?! Butler?! What they were thinking!?!) Agreed to be associated with it's MacLaine see the original, being justly impressed, and enlist a friend (with no writing credits - or talent! - for his name) to translate the themes to the American public - who both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid. So she summoned other friends to sign up, and they did as friends - certainly not for the merits of this pathetically planned script, anything but the kitchen sink. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of French films, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, thought-provoking and thought-provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I would love to see a wider exposure among English-speaking audiences - and if that means an American reprint, so be it. But puh-leeze! a bit of respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience - and a better direction for the actors, who could not decide whether they were working for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
