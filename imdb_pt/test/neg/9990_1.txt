I saw this movie at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. His reputation had preceded, and although all my friends were also of age, I alone had the courage to enter the store and actually rent it. We met in a house where the parents had left the city for the weekend. Although we sat very close to each other, we did not speak or recognize each other's presence. As it turned out, the movie deserved and did not deserve the anticipatory shame we feel. It did not disappoint in terms of pure free content, but disappointed in every other aspect. <br /> <br /> Caligula tries to transcend genres by combining an historical epic with a brazen pornographic film. He fails miserably in his ambition, subjecting the public to the worst of both worlds. The obvious selling point of the film is its pornographic aspect, and in fact provides much more than its share of real and graphic sex. But by establishing this sex in the context of the depraved kingdom of Caligula, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult film. Sex without context can at least be physically pleasurable for the adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are virtually absent from Caligula's world. In it, sex, at best, serves as an idle pastime and, at worst, as an instrument of sadistic domination. Nowadays, it is somewhat common to hear words such as "sin" and "depravity" used to describe acts that are pleasant but considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facet, depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from him. <br /> <br /> Historical portions not only fail to contextualize sex significantly, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue. or interest of the viewer in some way. They only provide long stretches of uninterrupted boredom. Rarely has a movie proven to be so boring. Sex, after the initial shock and wonder disappears, contributes only to the general monotony of the picture. <br /> <br /> Rarely does the discussion about this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula were made, few can rival him in terms of the shock value of his violence. Apparently, relentless barbarism, as well as hypodermic sexuality, characterized the emperor of Caligula. Violence is even less for the faint of heart than for sex. <br /> <br /> A comment like this will probably generate as much curiosity as it calms down. I understand why someone would want to see this movie; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by clearly describing its redeeming lack of value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about seeing or not. My high school criminal justice professor described police work as "hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror." This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned.
