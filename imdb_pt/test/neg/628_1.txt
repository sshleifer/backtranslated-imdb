L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where's your Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dickne Hickman? A Frenchman moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He will live with other students who are no more interesting than him, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is incredibly bland. The only bright spot was a beautiful French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She places her hands behind her head and reveals the shaved armpits, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. But naked armpits do not make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was funny, as was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard makes you wonder what's going wrong with the French comedy.
