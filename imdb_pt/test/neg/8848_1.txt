I do not see this movie. In most cases, like Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the American remake. However, this movie was terrible. Ghosts, much like a trick or a groomer, dress like a ghost of a sheet moan and wheeze in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is simply horrible. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained, letting the movie go from bad to worse. Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are more interesting things to do - like watch the paint dry.
