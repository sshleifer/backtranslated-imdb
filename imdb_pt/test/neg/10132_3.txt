Natalie Wood plays Courtney Patterson, a polio-disabled songwriter who tries to avoid being involved in her first love affair with her partner being lawyer Marcus Simon, warmly interpreted by Wood's husband Robert Wagner. The film is very clipped, but most of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand of the director, which allows Wagner to sleep consistently, devastating a solid and varied performance of Wood, who also plays a beautiful soprano. The script is somewhat banal, but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic deficiency is unfortunately in effect all the time, as he gets the free hand to impose his disjointed look on Wood, which should be discouraging for an actress. The progression of their relationship is presented unevenly and this, coupled with the unstable editing, causes the viewer to be less than sure as to what is happening, the motivation being almost completely ignored in writing. Although largely indistinct, cinematography shines during a brief scene when Wood is placed in a courtyard and, following the sound of a closed door, remains in the center as the camera's eye moves away, demonstrating its impotence and fragility. A more controlled direction would have allowed the artists, even the Mole Wagner, to scale their performance along the lines of an engaging relationship; as it was launched, there is, for the most part, an immense lack of commitment.
