OK, so not great, but only because of how big Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this movie received a full review, with improved image quality, adding new voiceovers to poorly dubbed voices and adding a nice understated background music, then this movie would really start to take shape. As it is, you have your problems. People define the age of the boys. What a surprise! they were in their 60s and they took a 'life'. However, for me, they still seemed to have a lot of charm, and while that does not even come close to tickling the feet of their classics (I gave them a 4), it's worth watching simply because they are them. To think otherwise would be impostor !!
