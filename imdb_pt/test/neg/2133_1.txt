This presumptuous, anti-environment, "Shark" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly dubbed and stupid. There is nothing redemptive about it. <br /> <br /> The plot follows some shark / octopus creatures that appear off the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a tearful wife and a husky husband who stabs with a fork for some reason). His rise to the surface is always represented by a vague side of something uncertain. It does not make sense, it's horribly boring, and your conspiracy plot sucks. <br /> <br /> There are moments of encampment that can not be ignored: the same shot of the couple's boat from the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor beating the chest of a patient dying twenty times with a diffuser without stopping, although he is clearly dead; the soundtrack of pornographic schemes; the photo of the couple making love on the beach, with three different themes ("That we're getting ahead!") doing this; the old computer that looks like Kermit the Frog; a beer-drinking scientist shouting "I know!" to Dr. Smith; <br /> <br /> Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears over the course of the movie (much noticed by Mike and the Bots). . The MST3K version is your best episode, but it certainly is better than the movie itself. "That's how I like to fish, guys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Crow A star for "devil's fish"; seven for the MST3K version <br /> <br />
