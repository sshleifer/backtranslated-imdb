I like J-horror, anime and even let's say the pink movement, of which some claim that this is a member, but this did nothing for me. I'm willing to take it one step further and label this one of the biggest disappointments of my career watching movies. <br /> <br /> Three young rockabillies are out there trying to escape raping girls. One of the group begins to develop a conciseness about his time of passage, when his younger sister almost catches them in the act. Invariably, the group turns when friends begin to quarrel with each other. It ends on a note consistent with the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> In addition to seeing friends yell at each other, which they do a lot, there is not much going on here. The film is full of slow continuous shots that only aggravate the problem. Moreover, even when the film begins to do something interesting, it suddenly gets bogged down in ethereal philosophy that never makes any sense. For example, after one of the friends has changed his mind about assaulting girls, he goes out and does it again, but then prevents his friends from doing their laps. There is? Cinematography is slow and the lighting is dim. The writing is good as well as the acting, which makes this a kinematic effort sub-par from the beginning. Mix the lack of technical dexterity with the fragile content and you will have nothing but a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more extra note, at least one of the girls on the buff does not seem old enough to do that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
