This noisy and flamboyant football from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except William H. Macy who could have dealt with the role played by Stone, the team doctors, or the "fruitcake" selling cereal . If you are a dirty mouth fan, there are some big, sweaty, creepy, put-down phrases you can try on two-faced friends and long-distance lovers. The film is sometimes as good as a festive background atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; he even features some scenes from MTV-style video clips. <br /> <br /> Any given Sunday (16/12/99) Oliver Stone - Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
