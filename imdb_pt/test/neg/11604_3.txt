Alfred Hitchcock made this bad-marriage comedy in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they have never been legally married and spend the film fighting back to true love. It does not have much reputation and it is easy to understand why. The jokes are familiar from better movies, but here they do not gel. And the links are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is cut and starched and it is doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know he's in the ear of a nut and tries his best to make a silk purse without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "the other man" (he has a lovely drunk scene). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock movies.
