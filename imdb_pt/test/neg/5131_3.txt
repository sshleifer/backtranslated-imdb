This movie obviously meant well. In the end, there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who, as a spectator, can only presume that she found herself in a situation similar to the one the film portrays. Maybe she made the "wrong" choice. This dedication is the ONLY redemptive quality of Love and Suicide. <br /> <br /> The film becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Since the viewer is already so annoyed, just five minutes after the movie, it will be much worse after that ... whatever. I know the film was low budget and the camera pictures were really good ... unfortunately, everything else was awful. The acting, the plot, the quality of the sound, the quality of the image ... the acting. I'm sorry, but the acting is horrible. Besides horrible. It's as if the actors were trying to act like people acting. That's the only way I can think to describe it. As I watched, I actually imagined the script with the direction of the stage in my mind. Neither movement was natural and none of the characters' reactions fit. In short, the time is OFF. The timing of the whole movie is far away. I am not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I really feel there has to be SOME way to convey the passage of time ... until they explained about the graduation not being far away I was under the impression that the first part of the film had taken place over a week ... a month at most. <br /> <br /> All that was said, it's really a shame. This movie really could have been powerful with some tweaks. All the moments in the movie where we should feel something are obvious, but only because the setting is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes fell completely. For example, when Kaye's brother takes the hat from his head and puts it on hers, we should feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and protection of her brother's love ... somehow, this does not happen way . There are so many other scenes like this (for example: ALL the fight scenes) and all they do is get the movie. All this together, Love & Suicide is a long and cheap commercial.
