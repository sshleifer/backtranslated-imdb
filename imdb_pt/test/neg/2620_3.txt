Now this is a movie that I really do not like. It is one of the most boring horror films of the 90s, mainly because it starts slowly and focuses on a boring environment. The settings are not appealing to the eyes and do not serve the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> The puppets look really extravagant, not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80 movies. What did they do with our favorite toys?! <br /> <br /> The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets. There are no death scenes like in the previous films and the f / x are terrible. <br /> <br /> I felt sleepy the first time I watched, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.
