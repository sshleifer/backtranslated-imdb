Cuore Sacro combines brilliant film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a screenplay that the writers of "Touched by an Angel" may have gone unnoticed for being very impassive, Ozpetek still keeps us interested sometimes. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives, but I found the last act so bizarre and bizarre that I think the couple who jumped to death early on may have been the lucky one. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the heart (pun intended) a story built on a grand finale in twist style. This kind of tenuous foundation can result in tremendous success as Una Pura Formalità de Tornatore or horrible trash like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro falls a little closer to the last. I found the cinematography generally above average. The filming of Irene obediently making her elbows in the pool were very impressive, as was the atmosphere conjured up by the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta, when Giancarlo comes from the rain and Irene poses with him, was a bit exaggerated. One major problem I had with the exception in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly to the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions going on. This worked with a fantastic effect on Windows Facing, but when employed here it seems that Bubolova is not a Mezzogiorno. In fact, apart from the ridiculous story, the main problem with this movie is the milquetoast performance of its main character. This made the final scene even more inconceivable. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ozpetek continues its crusade against our corporate-driven societies, urging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And while I'm certainly someone who is very sympathetic to this view, I felt as if the audience was being hit in the head with a blunt object. Could the characters have been more two-dimensional? I tended to find this movie very unnerving and soulless. Was "evil" aunt Eleonora anything more than a caricature? It is for people on the "right" side too, like the "good" Aunt Maria Clara and the old doorman Aurelio. And in case we missed Ozpetek's point of view, he decided to clothe his opposing forces in his own libres. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color. He wears the opening couple who briefly flies in black, as well as Irene (when we met for the first time and after his conversion of life), the evil aunt Eleonora and, of course, the good but confused Father Carras. Black is a color that suggests a definite course, the mind of the user is defined and without emotion. It is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern armor, the business suit. It is also the color of mourning, like the funerary ornament of the suicide duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, like the simple robes of priests and nuns that Irene emulates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart, is red. It is a color that has an inherently emotional extreme component. The character who wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; It challenges our perceptions of the user and, at the same time, makes the user vulnerable. Still red carries a huge weight of history and mysticism, as the first members of Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ocher and indeed the first man named in the Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, reminiscent of the past in which red (and by association an attitude less geared to life) was more accepted. Then when we come across the room full of red (the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red paint of a whirling dervish!) From Irene's mother, "good" characters Maria Clara and Aurelio wearing resplendent clothes from red, and finally, the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red dress, we can see where are the sympathies of Ozpetek. <br /> <br /> A word or two about the soundtrack, I found the original musical themes perfectly suited to the story. The almost Baroque theme that meant Irene was great for her monotony and unsettling uneasiness (the absolute best use of a constantly repeated Baroque theme, such as it would have to be on Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with its magisterial repetitions of a bar 8 bar). Sarabande attributed to Handel). An absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds from an opera aria we heard while the power is blinking while Irene is chasing Benny around the house. It is from the famous aria "Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano" from the opera "La Wally" de Catalani. The aria is sung by the main soprano who is leaving home forever. As Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can assume that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a moving farewell to her daughter, as in the movie that Irene is destined never to see Benny alive. I only have one small question about the soundtrack, why include the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love music and personally I could listen to it all the time, but it did not fit much here.
