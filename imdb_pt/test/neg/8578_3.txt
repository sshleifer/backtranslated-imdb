This movie is very disappointing to anyone who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clean tale about piracy in the Caribbean, and would have made a big move. Besides, it would have been very simple to do. All the action takes place on board the ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screenwriters took the Sabatini title and then threw the rest of the book away. Even the main character's name was changed, and his screen persona was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel. It is a sad loss for those who love a good history of the sea.
