This movie has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. There is a reason it was made to be a MOW (movie of the week). The continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting, although it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year 2004. HELLO. "Lord of the Rings" had better CGI than that. But I think they also had the money for that. The budget will certainly affect the outcome, but anyone who calls this MOW more than a 2 needs to go back to Film and TV school. Next time, remember that care and time do not make a classic run for a tornado box office or TV hit. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know that networks can reuse images from old or affiliated networks, but using images from 80 to 2004? I have a hard time buying this.
