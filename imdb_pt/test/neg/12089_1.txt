This film had an excellent premise, and it could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes towards women at work and female relationships in Britain at the beginning of the last century. However, it simply turned into a love story. But what was worse, is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was largely poor, the direction confusing, but above all the script and story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the movie was how dark it must have been before the electric lighting. I really have a notion of how little light a candle puts out.
