There have been so many things wrong with this movie that I have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the only one lying on the floor in the bathroom, what happens if Zep never shows up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before he got to the bathroom? Jigsaw just gets up and leaves? Could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw, but another part of the Jigsaw game? What if Zep killed his wife and son, how does Jigsaw give him the antidote to the poison if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to finally cut his foot? It was too late, it was past six, and as far as he knew his wife and son had been shot dead, it was not the best time for heroics. These are just a few questions I had about the movie, but I may be missing something or everything, as I've only seen the movie once. Please help!
