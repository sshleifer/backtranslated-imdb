I seem to remember a lot about this movie when it came out, but I've avoided seeing it over the years. I wish I had waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I do not know. I was younger then, but it did not look like the world was any different. Michelle Pfeiffer, lovely as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews landscapes, but fills her in his cheeks like a gerbil to save for later. Dean Stockwell is as convincing as a mob boss, as James Gandolfini would be the main dancer of the Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of late puberty I have ever seen. All in all, not bad enough to make you want to pluck your eyes with a melon ball, but it's not far off.
