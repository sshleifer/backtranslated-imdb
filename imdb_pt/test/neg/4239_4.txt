First, a warning. 'How to Marry a Millionaire' is preceded by a seemingly random five-minute orchestral performance of Street Scene, a Gershwin-lite piece treated with all the pomp and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. Sitting needs a little patience. If you have the DVD, stay calm, you can jump forward. You will not miss anything. The film itself is one of the perennial disappointments of the 1950s in Hollywood, a film so reinforced by the great stellar power, opulent mise-en-scene, and perfect high-concept that The Failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, are bound to wonder - how is this so weak? The script is an albatross about the neck of production, a dead, smelling thing that suffocates everything and everyone before they can really spark life. There are no comical situations, only isolated moments that play with laughter. Whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop, the film moves quickly to other, less interesting things. One case in point - the scene in which the three main ladies bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, myopic, refuses to wear his glasses for vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce, of course, complete with misguided identity, furious wife, and probably a pie in someone's face? Well no. Instead, we cut between the three dates while the ladies react 'comically' to the things their partners say. Hit the drill line and cut the next nonsense joke. If in doubt, ask Marilyn to enter the wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's films, and the camera just ate it, even if the script did not give her anything to do. She is so luminescent she almost looks like a newborn. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, has been a big star for almost a whole decade, and knows how to dominate the screen even when in contact with Monroe. She gets the only thing that passes for a real role, and offers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right stuff, she could have brought this thing to life. She is a curiously timeless actress - when she lies about her age in the movie and claims to be forty, she is not instantly ridiculous - let alone feminine than her castmates, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from eternal, and had a good eight years in her co-stars, putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. There is an air of desperation about her sometimes stranded on the screen with nothing but a smile of toothpaste and some scraps of comic timing, unable to play her actual age but fooling anyone as a contemporary of this younger generation of actresses , with the same old schtick who had served her throughout her career (for those who doubt Marilyn, seeing the two juxtaposed in this film helps to give Monroe's subtlety and - yes - intelligence in relief). She is also burdened with dead wood in terms of male co-stars (though all men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she is incapable of attacking any comic spark. Better to play her part in the underused Monroe, who could be funny on her own, and leave Grable with Mr. Magoo's repetitive routine. <br /> <br /> That the movie is as entertaining as possible be put into the delicious production of Hollywood, the kind that makes even the groom like "The Light of the Silver Moon" watchable. But somewhere, buried under the loose jokes and professionalism, is the outline of a cynical and sharp comedy about the marriage that Bacall might have had to sing - and new generations of viewers sit down with 'How to Marry a Millionaire' in expectation of that movie, ready to be disappointed again.
