Another example of the woman-in-prison genre. This is not exactly a genre known for quality movies, but that's a bit below the majority. A group of women is taken from the brothels, where they work for a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are subjected to a lot of misdirected sex and atrocious "dialogue." For a movie with an impressive amount of sex and nudity, there's really nothing erotic about any of it. The sex scenes are interpreted awkwardly, and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag on and on. That being said, there are at least some minimum production values. On the W-i-P scale I would place above Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun, but below Chained Heat.
