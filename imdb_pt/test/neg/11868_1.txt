At first glance, I must say already, watch The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes as well. A better action movie with a more dramatic plot. The Detonator has a horrendous plot focused on some kind of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with a bad direction for an action movie - there are no moments emotion and an action movie is turned into boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when horrible scripts like that are offered to him? Do not blame him, he needs the money. <br /> <br /> That was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago. But I will not see it again, not at all. Screw. Sucks. Over there. PS: I do not think I ever said "this movie sucks" in the IMDb critique. Thank you detonator!
