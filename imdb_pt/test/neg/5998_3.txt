Jackie Chan's films are typical examples of how much supply is greater than demand. Well, to be honest, what's the demand? In this Jackie Chan is whatever his name on this, I doubt he knows, and he is some kind of Well, he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is accelerated, that way I can do all the acrobatics as well. During the big finale, in which Jackie Chan wants to arrest the thug, hitting him in a race, we finally get to see how badly this production is. The Manchester fight, especially on the casino scene, is decent, but when we're talking about special effects, dear Lord. And everyone should hit this race? Stupid. And here is not really safe for drivers, there is not even a concrete wall in the vicinity. And do not tell me about what kind of horrible story this has, I mean, it's Hong Kong, it was probably written at point gun by eight years old, but still, what a mess. I like Chan as much as the next guy, maybe more since I've seen "Rush Hour", but the retarded cousin of his agent really needs to choose his designs better.
