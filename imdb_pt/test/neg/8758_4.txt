Oh, the horror! I've seen MANY bloody movies in my day, but this one just lets me laugh rather than disgust. This is definitely a crazy movie and it is very low budget, I might add, but if you are able to look beyond the cheap audio, horrible dialogue, ugly girls, the obviously fake gore scenes and total gross of the movie, then you may find that part of this movie is a bit of fun. The story is about a cat killer who makes a killing every "5th day, 5th month, 5th year" (wow, how original), and it is up to two detectives (one of whom has made a valiant effort to try to make the good harpsichord dialogue) to stop the bloody fury of the killer. The murder scenes (which are made with a plastic toy knife) are quite brutal (which is a good thing) but very annoying due to the constant repetition of a recorded scream (which is very piercing). As for blood, there is much, but it seems very false; especially the blood - dude, come, purple blood? But if you're a fan of gore videos like me then you'll find something in this video to cherish like I did (the detective talking badly ... he's the best thing for this movie). Also, all you'll find is a bunch of nonsense nonsense (which is also good, but it's a shame that the girls are xoxo) and a serial killer necrofilo very dumb. Sorry, but this sucks.
