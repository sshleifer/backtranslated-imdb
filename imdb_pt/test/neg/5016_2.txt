I'm not that old I do not remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a few times. But some in that, in all his years of drug abuse, he lost his sense of humor and his brain cells. <br /> <br /> From the moment this movie begins, you can not have sympathy or empathy for the female lead. Nor will you find something remotely funny after you hear the opening line. Goldwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade himself to feel better - even if it is his own imaginary characters that he degrades. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Shakes the Clown, you know how awkward Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It was not even funny by chance. It's sad, pathetic and a complete waste of time. The hands of May Goldthwaits may be paralyzed so he can not write another script. Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another bland scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to enter Hollywood
