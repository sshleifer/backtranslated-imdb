Guilty face Ritchie. The late 90s success of the Lock Stock de Cliche and Two Smoking Barrels unleashed a series of lamentable gangster films from which the genre has never recovered. Unfortunately Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Hardwood Essex Carlton Leach - is not likely to reverse this trend. Despite Hartnett's decent performance, the film falls prey to very familiar East End stereotypes. They're busy blowing up someone's brain or fucking a half-naked blonde. From fearsome football hooligans in the 1980s to a key figure in the underworld of crime during the 1990s, Footsoldier records Leach's rise through the ranks of bandits. Leaving the terraces for nightclubs, Leach becomes a security guard where he gave carte blanche to kick the shit out of anyone. Here he enters with notorious gang leaders, Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone), and begins to realize gang warfare and is not what it's ready to be. <br /> <br /> had deconstructed the laughable yob patois of screenwriter and director Julian Gilbey, since every sentence seems to begin with "Am I going to go crazy?" or "Are you faking it?" or occasionally 'So I've just been a' fackin '??, typically completed with a mandatory' caaaant '! 'The direction, too, smells of sadism, especially the obvious joy Gilbey gets from filming violent close-up scenes and, in the case of the bloody shotgun outcome, in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Gilbey's use of the classic narrative of rising and falling gangs is not what Footsoldier will condemn to the darkness of the big screen. Nor is it the fact that in the middle of the film, the film angers Leach in favor of the events that culminated in the infamous Tate and Tucker shootings. It is Gilbey's unhealthy appetite for the violence that spoils the film; whether it be a brick in the face or an ax in the head during a violent attack on a train, everything is unnecessarily prolonged. Footsoldier does not make much noise, but leaves you feeling violated and, more important, steals two hours of your life that you do not get back ...
