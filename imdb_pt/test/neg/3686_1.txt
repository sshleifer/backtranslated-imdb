I suffered the screening of this movie at the Sitges Festival last month. If there is the possibility of "unfilm" a movie to avoid its existence, this must be the first one in the list. María Lidón is not a director, she is just a dumb woman who pretends holding a camera with her hand and shouting "action" makes her a professional filmmaker. What a mistake! The film itself is useless and a total waste of good actors who could be doing something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but put his face in front of the camera. Your character has no specific weight in the movie. The same can say of Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It's a shame that Rade Serbedzija's character was written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of his time alone in the tunnels talking to himself on the way (now I am doing this, now I am with few bats, I will look in my bag, now I am turning left, now I'm turning to the right ...) just to bring the public a clear idea about their actions. It is simply absurd and proves the director's lack of talent. END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the film itself brought the clue on the rating that everyone should give: ZERO
