I almost laughed out loud when, during the commentary, the director said that this movie is original, with a strong plot. There is no one ... repeat an original plot or special effect in this blah movie. <br /> <br /> The crows .... Hitchcock did this superbly back before CGI and even with CGI this movie falls short of a well-done attack scene. The creepy creepy kid ... Grudge did it and did better. The psychotic ... made at Cold Creek Manor more recently, however, was done to the death. No pun intended. Disconnected / rebel teenager that no one listens to ... about a dozen movies used this one until the Beetlejuice. The basement stuff ... can you say Amnityville Horror? Doors opening unbidden ... What Lies Beneath did this with much more talent. Scary farm ... too numerous to mention. The scenario of metaphysics - which should have been the central focus, gets lost when you find out what is happening, which, by the way, is very early. <br /> <br /> Thing (of many, actually) that they do not even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked in by the mud in the basement, so they do not really have a body. <br /> <br /> In general ... DO NOT BOTHER
