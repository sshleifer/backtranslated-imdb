Where the hell did VH1 find the screenwriter for this movie ??? Out of high school? This film tries so hard to be nice to Michael Jackson, but instead turns it into a horrible and tacky cartoon. All the lines are full of clich√©s, but surprisingly the acting was not bad. As usual, this is a bad movie with very good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, dammit, I'm sorry for him! I think he did the best he could with the weak script. I did not mind that Flex did not look like Michael Jackson, I thought he did the best he could, but later, when he had all that white makeup, oh man, he looked disgusting! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were very good. Except that the actress who plays Liz Taylor looked very young and healthy to play Liz. The actress who plays Diana Ross did not look anything like her and I could not figure out who this woman was until much later in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie does a disservice to everyone who is on the side of Michael Jackson, or against Michael Jackson. It does nothing to change anyone's opinion. In fact, the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is, oh God, this movie really sucks! And where the hell is the music and the wonderful music of Michael Jackson? There are none to be found in this movie. I love the soundtrack to this movie and I'll probably buy it if I can. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, this is a very funny movie! It's a great waste of time if you want to watch something light that will not bother your brain too much. I'll probably watch it again, because it's so damn bad!
