Let me say this from the beginning. I do not hate this show. I really like some aspects of it. In fact, when I started watching it, I quickly got hooked. I was starting to get out of the stereotype "anime is for kids," and the mature elements of the show intrigued me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series and some of the movies, I can say that my general layout has changed, and this falls into almost every pitfall that afflicts the "bad" anime. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on TV. In the end, only a friend and I were still watching and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot to you. You can skip this paragraph if you do not want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical pit near her family shrine. When Kagome leaves the pit again, she was transported back in time to the feudal era of Japan. She meets many other characters and they form a group of five or more comrades who depart on a journey of revenge / justice / groping in a case of characters =). In general, they are trying to recover the fragments of the sacred gem fragment that increases the power of the demons that use it. <br /> <br /> Although there are many, many parallel stories and story arcs, there is no close enough material to occupy 167 episodes. The only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still kind of annoying (the band of seven). After half-way through the series, or even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided to put dozens and dozens of fill episodes. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no impact on the story and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters who have played a major role in the story will disappear by dozens of episodes at a time. Many episodes follow exactly the same cookie cut patterns from previous stories. Inuyasha fires a scar of wind against the enemy. The Windscar diverts. Characters gasp in horror. The enemy ends up having a barrier. The characters spent three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally shot sacred arrow at him and he turned into dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** HIGHER SPOILER: CONCLUSION WILL BE REVEALED ** Lack of any conclusion makes it look like you have 83 hour waistline. <br /> <br /> ** GREAT SPOILER OVER ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent. Even so, reused animation cells affect most action scenes, and it is very difficult to ignore them when it becomes clear that exactly the same stone has passed a character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> The brightest side, however, all the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating. In addition, the character designs (appearances) were brilliant and sometimes among the best I've seen, particularly with the band of seven. There is definitely no shortage of Cosplay opportunities here. Even so, I found myself waiting for a character to die just so there was some kind of movement in the plot. And a bit of humor in the show between the characters is used over and over again. A particular sit joke is found in the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used repeatedly in the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has many followers, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fans who babble for Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Worth checking out, but not worth watching the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very intelligent, unique and enjoyable for anyone. But after that, it just becomes monotonous and tedious. Watching a TV show should never seem like a chore, but somehow this series succeeds. Do not expect too much from "InuYasha" because you will only feel disappointed.
