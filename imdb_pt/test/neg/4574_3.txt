The year still has three weeks to go, but unless a really horrible turkey comes up sooner, Passion of the Mind may be the winner of my most evil movie of the year. An interesting idea poorly executed. And by the way, he acted badly. Demi Moore is very good at curling her lips and smoking cigarettes, but is that all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Ligitt and Myers or one of the other nicotine bad guys had some of their illicit profits invested in this production. It is confusing, silly and moves in the frenetic past of an arthritic earthworm. I gave it a 3. It should have been a 2! <br /> <br />
