This little cruel movie is horrendous. My low rating for this comes for two main reasons. The first is that it's an animal snuff film and I think all this vile concept that turns my stomach. Filmed over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. This film is a complete and complete exploration, made to profit from the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Leaving aside the historical interest, this is something to be observed only when one is bound to the morbid fascination. <br /> <br /> Reason number two? Here's how the camera is set up. He is placed in the best possible spot to fully capture the full effect: the elephant's long forward march, perfect view of the electrocution platform, and a cold, clinically dispassionate view of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before finally collapsing. Sick. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison did many good things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are not in doubt. No one is perfect, but when you realize that this film provided A) an opportunity for him to beat the older filmmakers with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and B) he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of DC as opposed to AC, you can not help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little indifferent and cold. Any number of crazy scientists from Peter Cushing would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and disgusted.
