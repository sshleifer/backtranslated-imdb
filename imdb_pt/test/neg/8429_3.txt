"Disappointing" is the best word I could think of for this movie, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other reviewers. <br /> <br /> One thing that really spoils the movie is that it is blatantly partial (in both senses of the word). Not only does it feature a very selective description of the games (focusing on the US athletics team), but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties faced by the US team. <br /> <br /> What is even more disturbing is that all omissions and mistakes (?) seem to glorify the US sporting spirit to the exclusion of other athletes (with a few notable exceptions). For example, the viewer is led to believe that the US won the majority of the medals in the Games, when in fact they won only one of four gold medals and one of a total of 6. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen (so we have an arrogant Brit and a Frenchman who speaks wine). This attitude gives very little service to the Olympic ideals that the film should celebrate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that this movie will appeal to the American public who is looking for a quick boost. of national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of games are advised to look elsewhere.
