I'm going to start my analysis by saying that I'm not a fan of the independent straight-to-video genre that has a big debt to the grindhouse movies of the 1960s. I do not own any, I've never rented any, so I can miss the appreciation for those cheap and low budget tricks that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I got this movie at Cinemax late one Saturday night with a friend. Please do not ask me why I was watching Cinemax at the end of a Saturday night with a friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some of Misty Mundae's bad atrocities (and I wish she did not confess to being from Illinois, as we actually ended up being some brilliant here) caught our attention. Now, normally, the goal of good soft-core porn would be to put you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex, ironic humor and who knows what might happen? After about 15 minutes, and a scene in which the title character seduces a victim of assault, my friend said: 'If you want to watch the rest of this fine, I go to bed, so I do not need. Please turn the volume off. Here's what I've put together of the plot: Misty's character is an asexual nerd who is bitten by a spider and transforms into a super-sex kitten with super slinging powers that do not come from his wrists. There's some kind of evil villain involved, who did not seem particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, MJ (who is man in this movie) is constantly approached by stereotypically bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil villain is pushed from a building to her death. <br /> <br /> What was good about this movie? Ended. <br /> <br /> What was bad about that? Acting to make a third grade contest looks like an Oscar winner, a screenplay revealed by people I imagine to be drunk, perverts who do not know what sex is if they participated in a lecture given by Dr. Ruth, special effects that were as special as someone jumping off a trampoline, humor as funny as ?? well, I still have to find anything that is weaker. The sex scenes? If we were watching a video, the only thing these scenes would have turned on would be the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had a better choreography. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this kind of movie should be appreciated for its inherent evil. Companies like the EI do not plan to make good films: they have a niche and are targeted. My experience as a marketer tells me that they have the money they need to serve their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe', I can say that I'm not diving into this world again so soon. Perhaps the problem with filmmakers in this kind of genre is this: they spend so much attention on making bad movies that if they strive to focus on those things that they do very well, they will become very nice. 'le bad' Cinema, movies of Troma in the 80s. Sorry guys; the spirit is there, but the effort is not. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me?
