This is officially the terrible, boring, tacky and ridiculous movie ever created. The movie is about a crazy boy and his friends, and they get a 747. Their dreams are very gross and do not make any sense, and it's very badly done. Each special effect seems to have been made without any modern technology, and may have been created by the kid who plays the "leading role" in the film. If you watch this movie, it will definitely make you dumber. I advise you to never consider watching this movie, and if you do, good luck and do not miss the brain cells you killed. My comment does not even fully understand the horrible creation of the hell that was made. The person who wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie I watched terribly, and I wish I had never seen it. Peace.
