Anyone who knows anything about evolution would not even need to see the movie to say "fake." "never been denied" is also a weak argument. To say that the universe was created by a giant hippopotamus can not be denied. Although, to be fair, it seems the only people who believe are the same people who open e-mail attachments from people who do not know or give their bank details to a guy in Zambia. No bone of any primate was found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists do not bother to study this. The same argument holds true for the Loch Ness monster, ghosts and god.
