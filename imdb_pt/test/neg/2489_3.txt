There is no real story that the film seems more of a fly in the wall drama documentary than an appropriate film, so this piece itself may be a spoiler. Juvenile drama about 3 young children from Singapore (much like the Chavs of the UK) who play at school, run with gangs, fight, insult people on the street, get tattoos, do nothing, etc. etc., they usually imagine being tough and from time to time shouting challenging rap corners for the camera. Shot in MTV style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, tight closes and animation interludes. The dialogue may have been clearer in the original Mandarin and Hokkien languages ​​than in the legends and I have no doubt that some of Singapore's contemporary references will pass through the Western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless you know Singapore . This type of adolescent film may be the first in Singapore, but it has been done before and done better in other Western countries, La Haine (1995), for example.
