Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie, you have to see this, I guess. It contains all the "scary parts where nothing happens," "the nerd guy who is not really dead," "boy and girl uniting and surviving," "facing an old child - fear, etc ... I can continue. I wanted to see this movie because I thought about mixing a video game and a movie would work. I think I was wrong. What makes the film more bearable? It's only 1h17min so if you're bored it might be a good idea although I'd rather be bored. Why do not you absolutely see it? Frankie Munitz, also known as Malcolm, is just annoying as the nerd type. I could hit the guy and it's so sad that he did not die sooner and at the end he even comes back. See something else!
