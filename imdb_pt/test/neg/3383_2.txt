What an absolute joke of a movie. The case for this movie that you believe is duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good movies by itself and you would think that by using your project, the MM could not go very wrong. Well, that's what I thought and I was very, very much mistaken! <br /> <br /> We accompany two college students as they travel miles through the desert to get to a wedding. They catch a girl (no, she does not take off her clothes), so they are chased by a Leatherface rip on a Monster Truck, whom they appropriately call F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). Monster Truck, I admit, is a very cool vehicle, but less expensive chase scenes ruin its potential. <br /> <br /> So, MM decides he has a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases. they for a while, they release him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then head to a motel where the main character Adam sleeps with hitch-hiker Sarah (although they both wear underwear!). Then they are captured by MM, taken to their home, where they escape death and try to kill MM, but fail, hence the setup for the sequel. Aside from a little 'touch', that's it. <br /> <br /> If you can get past the first 2 minutes ?? where Adam's friend Harley appears hidden in the back of Adam's car to try to scare him, with no explanation of how Harley got there, how long or how Adam did not even notice? without thinking that you already hate, then you can just enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The Monstrous Man has a very bad cinematography and direction, which is immediately disappointing. This is the kind of movie that you could catch as one of those movies in a box of 20 horror movies that you have never heard of. <br /> <br /> What's so annoying is Blockbuster. stock so many of those shoddy movies that are filmed digitally by some amateur movie students, and that's exactly what MM is (though IMDb claims that this particular director was born in 1961). movie is atrocious. The script, which the writer obviously finds funny, is annoying and childish. You get the impression that only a draft was written before you started filming. Actually, the script is horrible. A lot of the movies look like they're improvised, full of those boring, boring conversations that are funny or important to the people involved. Imagine that you filmed yourself and your friends talking, of course, the points are funny ?? For you, but mostly it's crap. That's what the MM script is like. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this for gore or ?? is very minimalist and there are very good movies out there (Bad Taste, Evil Dead et al ??) Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even with their holes and drills, are far superior to this movie. Compare the introduction of Jeepers Creepers to the introduction of Monster Man and you'll see what I mean.
