That comes close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The writer begins in a way that you go side with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) leaves him for Kelley (Chris Klein) in a way that makes you mad at Sam. You do not let it show what she feels, so your feelings about Kelley are not real to you, and their relationship is false. It drags you in any direction, and gets quite exhausting and irritating. The only good thing about this movie that I saw was the cast. <br /> <br />
