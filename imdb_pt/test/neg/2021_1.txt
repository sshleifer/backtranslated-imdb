I'm speechless. This movie is beyond description. I do not believe there is a language on Earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this movie is. If you try to watch it, stay tuned to the "end of the surprise". I only made about three-quarters of the way through this piece of garbage before I could take it anymore. Luckily (or sadly) some of my friends stayed by the end. When they awoke from the coma and after a few weeks of therapy, they were able to let me know what I had missed. This movie has no story, no plot, horrible writing and even worse acting. If you enjoy watching train accidents or car accidents, then this movie is for you. I think my IQ dropped about 30 points when watching this (insert here expletive).
