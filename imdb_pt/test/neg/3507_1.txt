I agree with what so many others have said about the superficial and offensive nature of the film's racism examination. It is disconcerting to me that so many people seem to have been deceived by their pretense. I want to comment on the character Matt Dillon as an example of what is most annoying about this movie. Here we have a man who - in contrast to the underlying message of the film that "we are all a LITTLE racist" - effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately urging him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple out without any legal cause, but because, as we come to understand, they are black and rich and he is a wounded little boy who is now the police and can therefore do whatever he wants. This behavior is not a racist LITTLE. This behavior is bad. It is disturbing to me that this extreme racism is kept alongside the behavior of another character - reciting their paranoid stereotypes about gang violence - to illustrate that everyone is a little racist. Later, we are fed a shit about Dillon's poor father and how the blacks took him to the poor house. Should this explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And does Dillon's character want to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated, unbelievable, laughable and coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually abused the night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the superficiality of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and end it.
