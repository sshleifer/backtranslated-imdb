The worst movie I've ever seen. I still do not understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do. Maybe they had accounts to pay ... The best part of the cult happens during a flashback that brings us during World War II when a Nazi official hides his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of a typical serial killer life! It seems to be directed during the early 80's, but then comes a new Beattle ... Awesome! This movie was directed in 2001 ... I'm sure it took less than two weeks to make the movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife filed for divorce after she saw the photo and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to being the man under the yellow baseball cap. Pathetic!
