Like horror movies, "Rest Stop," it could have been better on many levels. Director / Writer John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions when he started. Unfortunately, he was not sure what to do with the material, or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a film different from what he intended, either by the studio or the sponsors. Several endings were included on the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psychopath wandering the back roads of a remote part of California presents many possibilities in the first place. After Jess disappears in the scary stop, things get out of control. Poor Nicole is left alone to take care of herself of all the weirdos she meets along the way. <br /> <br /> It became clear when someone began to hear "Amazing Grace" in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways. in which a Jessica Nicole desecrates the neck of the forest, engaging in careless sex that is not appreciated by the natives. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. There is a lot of gore for fans of the genre.
