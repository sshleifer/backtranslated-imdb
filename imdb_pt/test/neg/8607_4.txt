Sex Lives of the Potato Men is about the sex life of several men involved in providing potatoes. So there are no surprises there. It is, in fact, practically what you can expect from the title: that is, it is a peculiar comedy involving men of sex and potatoes. Sometimes the movie works. It's a nervous, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of somewhat unimportant and rather average men who are having problems of various kinds with women. Where the film clearly does not work, and why it failed at the box office, is that the quirky and uncomfortable parts may be just a little subtle and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing during the scene of a man hanging from a ceiling in the basement masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife, I think most of us just sort of groan awkwardly and wonder what Andy Humphries was thinking. Well, maybe they'll show us what he was thinking very clearly.
