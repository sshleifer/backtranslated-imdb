The bad news: the Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar released by Maple Pictures that I saw was of poor quality. Dark and faded, it seemed to be dubbed a VHS tape. He even jumps at a point due to some missing pictures. <br /> <br /> The good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD has little effect on my viewing pleasure. This horror movie can not create tension and is not afraid. It's a horror movie without horror. While the scariest movies have a limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character will repeat something we just heard from two other characters. Presumably, the entire chat works like filling a unimaginative, budget-poor movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not exaggerated enough to be worth watching.
