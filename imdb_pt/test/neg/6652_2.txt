I can not believe I watched this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" in which I kept waiting for this to improve, which never happened. The sound is terrible, going too low to hear the chats, the sound shrill in seconds. The plot is absolutely implausible, the acting is mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good work as a mental case, although being labeled in that role can certainly be considered negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medicines, science or anything of a technical nature. "Sociopata" ???? I wonder how they came to this diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, nonsense, and the wrong things about this movie that if someone listed them all, it would possibly set some sort of record. Demerol as general anesthesia? A motorcyclist on the road wearing a DOT / Snell off-road helmet. San Francisco??? The paper walls move when touched, the helmets appear out of nowhere, the guns point one way, but they hit things in another, the lighting appears and disappears and there is hardly a scene in the play that does not contain some kind of mistake. My wife, who is a Nurse at an oncology unit, finally left the room before the end of the movie, so upset with all the medical errors. I gave a 2 only because of the performance of Keaton, otherwise surely would have achieved a 1.
