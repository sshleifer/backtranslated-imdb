Why do people make bad movies? Anyone who was working on the photo knew that what they were doing made no sense? There is something about this photo that threw me out, plus the fact that I found this "movie" unrealistic, pathetic and malicious. I admire them for the attempt, but the "actors" of the movie sometimes seem to be trying hard and no character has substance or says something slightly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I do not have this option, so it gets a 1.
