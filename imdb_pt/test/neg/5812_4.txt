Hedy Lamarr, who may have been held by more men onscreen than any other actress, is once again the mistress of Kent Taylor, playboy society and general of all time. In a Yucatan boat after Taylor gave her the brush she tries suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy saves her from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is the whole doctor. I think he's never heard the word expert. He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his trip was a secondary activity in medical research. Lamarr and he get married and she tries to introduce him to their world and he even becomes a partner of the society doctor Louis Calhern. Of course Kent Taylor enters the scene again and the inevitable Hollywood happens. <br /> <br /> Watching I Take This Woman, it seemed to me that the writers were very influenced by Boys Town winning the Tracy Oscar. Unfortunately, his role as Doctor Karl Decker is not a patch on what he did as father Flanagan. Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan some romance in his life in this movie, so to speak. <br /> Tracy and Lamarr did not get along very well. In fact, this movie was called I Retake This Woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg left the film, presumably because Lamarr was not working for him the way Marlene Dietrich did. She made Lady of the Tropics and then MGM went back to filming it with her contract director, Woody Van Dyke, who was known for the speed of her productions. And a whole new cast of support was brought in. Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles in the store for both of them.
