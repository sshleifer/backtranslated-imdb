OK, I saw this movie through the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie, so I figured I'd leave a comment on it. I love once again how Joe gets stuck with the bad roles while his brother and nephew are just getting the Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call a movie that should be good. It seemed that the director and the actors only took this film extremely seriously and had very extravagant effects, a story that did not make much sense, not to mention very bad acting skills. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes, simple because a lot of what they mention is what we're thinking throughout the movie and I'll explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are a couple who have separated and now are trying to sort things out. But since Zach is in the lower class and Natalie is in the middle class, that will not work. But on the way home, they and Zach's friends are in a car crash and now the Death Angel / Soultaker is behind them to fulfill their breathtaking quota. But it also seems like he had some kind of life relationship with Natalie and just can not move on. So now Natalie and Zach must run against the ever appearing five million times a minute to save their souls and lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I think Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith was wrong too, lol. Basically, there are many holes in the movies, as no one can see the characters and they can not be killed, but somehow they can still press buttons and open doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and was a little distracted from the story itself. Soultaker was just a bad movie that was rushed and makes you feel so bad for Joe, Sheen / Estovez's underestimated brother. <br /> 2/10
