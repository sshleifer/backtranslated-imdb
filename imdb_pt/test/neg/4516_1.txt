This is truly abysmal. I just got a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after hearing good things about it, and I have to say, this was so incredibly bland and bad, it will leave you numb and confused as this has already been done. <br /> I mean, what is it? Is this the typical humor of the late 70's? I think not. This is so bad, and believe me, I do not mean "so bad it's good" too. This is a collection of extremely dull skits, as if you were watching cable TV. Sure enough, this was an HBO show, and thinking that this might have been considered groundbreaking is scary. <br /> <br /> There is a rather pretty girl in it, and there are some old NHL images about NY Islanders hockey. team, which is fun to watch, even though I am a fan of NY Rangers throughout life. But they spoil it all, while trying to get some humor out of two hockey players hitting the ice as if they were "dancing" and, even worse, flipping the video of two hockey players struggling to look like they are having sex. Oh, how funny! In a slight cleverness, there is an interview with a hockey player named "Chico" who looks like NY Islander goalie Chico Resch, but they even blow this up by making him wear a Rangers jersey! Well, maybe that was intentional, who knows. <br /> <br /> The result is that "Disco Beaver" is so blatantly horrible, so incredibly bad, that you will definitely feel cheated after watching it and wasting almost an hour of your life. You wonder what made the garbage manufacturers think they had something funny here, and you wonder why these skits can not even come close to the worst slop on Saturday Night Night. Amazing. Simply incredible.
