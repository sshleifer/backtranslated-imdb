First, they spoil everything with the exceptional quality of bad animation, so they get voices that do not sound like the original. They make so many mistakes in the movies. When Sasha is singing in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and reappears, Itchy's t-shirt changes color, his hat keeps changing position, one of the bridges is white, everyone in the background looks fat, halos continue to change colors and appearing and disappearing . Even the sky seems different. I do not give a shit if this is a low budget movie, they should not cut corners into animation. They completely ruined the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
