I think it's very interesting this movie is called a thriller. It's nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear piano sounds. Then you hear piano sounds. So some people talk about facts that do not concern anyone. <br /> <br /> Then again, piano sounds. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was the reason I registered for IMDb, because I think this movie is one of those that humanity has to be warned about. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most action-like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: the "actors". Yes, the quotations are intentional, as you may think, because they do not act. They play the piano and make headlines, but they do not. <br /> <br /> I think before this movie I never left a movie theater and felt angry. Actually, this movie made me angry. Angered by the time and money I spent on it.
