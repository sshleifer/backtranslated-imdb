.... that's where I'm guessing this movie came from. I mean, I watched a lot of B movies throughout my youth so far, and I would not even rate it as a B movie. I remember watching movies in my high school media class that outperform this. <br /> <br /> So the premise is ... a lot of dance numbers and dumb crap happens. Women in bikinis, who are not so pretty to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. Faces with hairy breasts appear and girls with fangs standing in the sunlight. I mean, I can barely put together a cohesive phrase just thinking about this movie. According to most people on this site, Hands Hands of Destiny and People Pod are the worst movies (MST3K's classics :-D) ... I used to be one of them. So I saw this movie. Usually I do not try to destroy a movie a lot, but the people who did it really deserve it. It's so bad and unbearable, and I'm assuming the film's director or actor is the only person who rated it as a ten.
