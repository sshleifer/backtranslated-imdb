It has been mentioned by others the futile dialogue of this series and I agree. <br /> <br /> If Mom and Daughter were really smart, they should be Queen and Princess of the Universe, not kicking in some small town. <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch a few episodes, but when the witty staccato mumbled about pop culture began, I turned the channel on. <br /> <br /> I watched a new episode to see if anything had changed (to the best I expected), but no, even old "we are so smart with our references to pop culture" that I almost threw up. <br /> <br /> Longtime fans who are not happy with the new seasons may just be starting to get sick with the regurgitated pablum that never stops.
