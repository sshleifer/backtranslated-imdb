you know, I always like disturbing or weird movies, especially when they are exhibited at the festival of fantasy films in Hamburg, Germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. Will this comment contain any spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, because I did not understand this movie. but well, what can you expect from a movie that was presented to a festival audience? "We (the guys at the festival) know that not all of you will watch this until the end" ... <br /> I like splatter movies and I also like movies with a strong graphic language. but that? There are many bloody scenes in this, but why? What is the director trying to tell us? Is he saying that we have lost all morality and all religious sentiment? or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster? who knows - I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for a long time - watch. but do not expect to think "wow, I understood the message" - I did not understand ...
