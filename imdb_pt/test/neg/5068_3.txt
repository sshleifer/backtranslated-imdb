Much like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this film can not tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism. No embarrassment, just throw naked women on the screen; No, it does not work like that. If close-ups of the female genitalia are not your thing, be prepared to be looking away from the screen at many points (I've always done it). The mentality of the movie "all women are crazy at heart" is offensive, and the "story" is sometimes absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). But in the middle of the way there is a random scene that comes out of nowhere and involves one of the prisoners (women) and one of the guards (men) in a wrestling match, which she gains with some judo moves. Although the fight's choreography is poor, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. In fact, this scene and good cinematography are the only two reasons why I give this movie * 4, instead of 0.
