Like many fans of western Pennsylvania history, I was really looking forward to this much-publicized PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However, I must say now that I was a bit disappointed. On the plus side, I think, overall, this movie did a good job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular, his presentation from the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and rather interesting, though it was certainly overemphasized in time. Also on the positive side, the mix of narrative and action scenes was well done and came a bit better than many of these typical documentaries made from interviews with "experts" and stills (at Ken Burns). On the downside, many of the battles had a "staged" appearance and many important aspects of the war were neglected. Above all, I was very disappointed and frustrated by the scant importance given to Forbes' successful campaign in 1758 against Fort Duquesne, compared to the previous failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was a bit disbelieved that there was no mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary of the British service who was largely responsible for Forbes' success. Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the Battle of Bushy Run of 1763 which began as a reprint of Braddock's defeat, but ended as the victory that decided the outcome of the Pontiac War thanks to the arduousness of the same Colonel Bouquet which must certainly rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.
