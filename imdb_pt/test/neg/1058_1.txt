Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was just terrible. Poor actors had no material to work with! <br /> <br /> The DVD cover has invited you to a flying action movie. You'd expect something like Top Gun ... Huge disappointment! The escape action in this movie is so cheap that it makes you vomit. The aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other sources of images, not made for this film. And they did not even care about brands or fighter models, assuming the public would not realize that. <br /> <br /> Like I said, the story was lame. With a little effort from the writer and director, it could have been very interesting. In short, it looks like a B movie made in the '70s. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for these actors who put their names here. They certainly should be ashamed.
