Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious horror movie. We're mixing Friday the 13th with the Blair Witch project and adding .... a killer in a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget for this movie must have been very low, some of the actors touched multiple parts and the camera used produced an image equal to the original version of the original Night of the Living Dead, which if anyone watched this version, will support me saying it is bad. <br /> <br /> This movie was just so bad. There is nothing in the movie that is worth watching. The very fact that I had seen it all the time surprised me. Just accept my advice and do not buy or rent this movie. It's terrible.
