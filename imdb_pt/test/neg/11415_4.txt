The main scene in Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Lives" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden in a hotel room where she is having an affair with Aiden Quinn, finds a documentary about nature on television, at which point Quinn notices the device of such things. Separate images are edited into a scene, predators and prey are thrown together to capture the moment - all to force connections where they do not really exist. The characters from the nine shorts that make up this movie occasionally overflow into each other's stories, but none of them seem to really connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is seen later working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who meets an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been then hosts, with his current wife, a dinner for an unhappy couple. Garcia organizes some of his characters in front of the other, but none of the subsequent stories actually builds on what came before. Garcia's first film, The Wonderful, Forgotten "Things You Can Say Just By Looking At Her," also had a structure of tales and overlapping characters, but there were less of them and they had much more space to breathe and grow. The puzzling premise of "Nine Lives," that each of its nine stories is told in a single, uninterrupted real-time view, never allows the film to build any real dramatic tension or impulse. It's also a visually ugly film. Inner shots are often obscure and difficult to watch, while other scenes - particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between the rooms to talk to her less-communicative parents - are bothered by camera work. Given that this is Garcia's third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television, the direction in this film is surprisingly amateur. Like his colleague Rebecca Miller, filmmaker, daughter of a great writer, Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films, often to the detriment of the films. <br /> <br /> Individual scenes are touching and even affecting. I liked Jason Issacs kissing Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna whispers lovingly to his wife as she enters preoperative sedation. And Sissy Spacek stole some happy moments from her life with Aiden Quinn before bringing her back with a phone call from her daughter. But the film (unlike "Things You Can Count On Just By Looking At It") seems more of an exercise than a real drama. We're just watching people act.
