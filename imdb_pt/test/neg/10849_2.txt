As I mentioned in other reviews, I have become a big fan of David Bradley since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". The guy is great doing martial arts, has some kind of charisma and is a cool guy on the screen. Unfortunately, he has been to the DTV department since his debut and remained as one of the Kings of the TV movies until 2001, where he has apparently stopped making films. Now, it's one thing to watch Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice, which are bad but fun movies to watch (because they're fun if it has any meaning), but another thing is watching a tasteless boredom like Total Reality . I mean, this and Crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse manure this guy has ever done. I would not recommend this even to Bradly's biggest hardcore fans. If I knew that and Crisis was such a fuck, I would not have spent the 3 or 4 euros that cost me. Total Reality is as boring as the Crisis, although, funny, it gets promising. A group of military prisoners in the future will have the chance to stop with some kind of disaster in the past (sorry, I did not really pay much attention to this atrocity) and they only have 24 hours to come back or something like that. If they do not, they will be trapped forever. The poor director who supervised this, "tries" some humorous clich√©s (?) Like the condemned who arrive on Earth and do not know what a truck, for example (wow, hilarious ...). The film follows with David Bradley joining an Earth Girl for the rest of the film. This made me so bored that I had to force myself to watch it in 3 or 4 installments to at least make use of the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. That's because every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you make a movie with David Bradley with only a 10-second scene, then that's the finishing touch that would help throw him on a 30-meter cliff so you'll never see him again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this pile of poop on the street and I swear to God I'd ask him back for 5 euros. I'd also love to meet David Bradley to ask why, in God's name, he chose to star in this poor excuse for a movie. Do not bother with this movie, I mean from the bottom of my heart, not renting and especially not to buy it.
