This film is a mediocre and low budget film. I've seen much worse in MST3K, let me assure you, but this is still a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clonus, a highly secretive government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. It is an almost Orwellian society, in fact: almost (but not completely) effective. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to roll down when the main clone (Tim Connely of the fame of 'Emergency') falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and at most four other films this was not his first movie}). They begin to suspect something. After finding a can of beer in the nearby river, the plot begins to unravel. The clone receives no responses from either the chief scientist (Dick Sargent of Bewitched) or the Confessional, a supposedly know-it-all computer, so he invades the Clonus main building and (in a scene hilariously destroyed by Mike and Bots) discovers the truth including a video clone that mysteriously shows exactly the same method that was used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this movie was made more than twenty years ago ...) about Clonus. He frees himself, pursued by two guards. He has one hell of a time breaking the two-foot high fences, although he has a considerably harder time climbing some boulders. From there, continue to slide. Also appearing are Peter Graves ("Starting the End", "Conquered the World") as presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once Upon A Time in the West") and Lurleen. Tuttle as the elderly couple who helps Clony after he escapes. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes of all time. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the movie, 10 for the MST3K version.
