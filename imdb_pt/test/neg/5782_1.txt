This movie is absolutely terrible ... Definitely a bull story and even worse acting. Too bad that Charlie Sheen is involved in something like that since he's a decent actor and made some really good movies. <br /> <br /> Special effects are the standard 'A-team' with the classic car. shot, and then turns around with a little fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Of course the enemies are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say "Americans die from evil". Unless the braindead movies are your game, do not spend 113 minutes of your life with this crap. Take the 'Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now'.
