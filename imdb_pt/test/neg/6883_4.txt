It's hard to comment on this movie. It's one of the few films that Dimension has not really filed (it's hard to come to a reason) and rushed to an impressive start to the year in the 500 movie theaters. Maybe Dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using their tow truck to separate a house piece by piece. Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in return he is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drownings. In the morgue, Ray comes back to life and chases a group of teenagers who witnessed the occurrence of the terrible accident. <br /> <br /> What brings this film down is that it's a paper thin. I did not care for a moment with any of them. In addition, the dialogue was less than ho-hum. Also, it was very predictable. The characters did the typical dumb things of horror movies, such as checking for creaks, calling people names, and tripping over a stone while being chased. I could also immediately choose who the final girl would be. And why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever someone died or whenever the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What is good? Well, there is an awesome suspense scene where the killer walks under the swamp waters to reach his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with a bunch of other bodies while the killer looks. <br /> <br /> But besides that, it's another August / September disappointment. I was looking forward to it, but I did not get what was expected.
