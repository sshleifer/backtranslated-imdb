I think "Bone Snatcher" should go after someone associated with this movie. Watching this will look like the longest 90 minutes of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrible, even remotely. If you can handle this good piece of cinematic art to the end, either you will be very disappointed or you will die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I read. I wanted to get my money back. What a skunker. If you are looking for a horror movie that will grab your interest, watch "U Turn". It may be based on a crazy storyline, but it's full of those scary scenes that keep you jumping from start to finish.
