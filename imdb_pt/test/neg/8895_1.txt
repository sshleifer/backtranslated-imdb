I was a Buffy fan and hoped it would come to an end when Angel had just one more season. But when the end got closer, I went out to see it. And what do we get? This episode called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last one. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed with this episode. This is absolutely the worst way for this series. Why did not you get a happy ending? Why did some of the main characters die? Why did not Angel become a human and reunited with Buffy? No. Angel has to sign this piece of paper that he will never become a human being. How stupid. <br /> <br /> And the end is a moment of anguish. <br /> <br /> What could have been worse? The Buffyshow started as big as Angel, but the hole in the Universe ended so bad. Someone should put a spell on the man who wrote the script for this episode and make sure he is lost in hell. <br /> <br /> So do not bother watching it, it's so bad, it hurts! Totally 1 in 10.
