From time to time, I let my children look at this garbage so they understand how pathetic the "competitors" of the program are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they have detained their dignity by a few minutes of fame and fortune. <br /> <br /> For anyone to appear on National TV and cry, sniff and complain about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Does this suggest that your lifestyle choices and the consequences of them are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> "The Biggest Loser" is an appropriate title, but it has nothing to do with someone's weight. Absolute garbage.
