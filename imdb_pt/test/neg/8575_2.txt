I usually do not like to comment on acting in a movie because it's the only thing people who have agenda against a movie go after. In this movie, I'll make an exception. The performance in this movie is below average. I mean, in the middle of the movie, I wonder how the hell the producer and / or director goes around casting a group of people who can not act. Even if the value of the production was good, the poorly written story only added to the poor performance of the actors, and there is even an indecisive attempt to distort the end of the film, which ends up being confusing. Are all Spanish horror movies so disappointing?
