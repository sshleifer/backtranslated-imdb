35 years after that, Castro still reigns. Unfortunately, we scratch our heads wondering how the phony maniac played by Jack Palance chewed on the scene until 1960. I stumbled on this recently and had a good time noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and "B". favorite movie Paul (Untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously well beyond his prime when he addressed this foolishness. Some of the lines are classic in a "Did he really say that kind of way?" The other thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialogue) are really excellent - the only front-line elements of any production. So do not watch this to learn anything about story or acting, but if you feel like watching it, bring the beers and have fun.
