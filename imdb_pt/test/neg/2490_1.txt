I did a screen test and read the script of this turkey in 1988. It was horrible and even worse now - I saw it on VHS in the local Video HollowWood and said "oh, what the hey, for auld ang sine". Yech. <br /> <br /> They had to film most of the time in Mexico after they ran out of money, some of the "stars" threw bitches because they ended up with an exotic soda pop. The plot of the movie is fine, I suppose, but it turns out I know the writer intended him to have a spy tracker all over. <br /> <br /> Dr. turned out to be a cartoon character. He must still be spinning in his grave at the Kremlin Wall. <br /> <br /> Technical errors occurred throughout the film, not just with children's atomic technology, but with uniforms, insignia and military jargon. They were very cheap to hire a professional military adviser, of course. Even the august and seasoned presence of Mr. Newman could not have saved this bird from being stuffed for Thanksgiving.
