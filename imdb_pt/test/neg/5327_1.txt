I thought I'd seen this movie before, as the plot summary sounded familiar. However, when I watched one afternoon (needing some irrational but fun entertainment), I did not recognize anything - if I had seen this before, I must have blocked the horror of it from my memory. > <br /> This movie is horrible and shows its age. It actually looks older than it is: more like an idiot comedy from the '80s. Although I'm a fan of bathroom humor and can see the funny side of many things, this is "comedy" in its most puerile and homophobic form . The plot is as thin as a Supermodel, which would not bother me if the movie were funny. <br /> <br /> There's just one fun line throughout the film, spoken by the character Louis: "It looks like someone threw out a perfectly good white boy!" In fact, Louis is the only nice character (and that's not saying very). James and Carl are the kind of annoying and immature man a sensible woman would run a mile away, her games as funny as the war in Iraq; Susan Wilkins' character is colorless (she looks like Julia Roberts but does not have her charisma) and there is no chemistry between her and Carl - though it may be unfair to blame the actress, since she does not know what she could have done with such a bad part writing; and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable. <br /> <br /> There is good trash and bad trash. This is the trash that definitely should not be recycled.
