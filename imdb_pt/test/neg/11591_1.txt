Komodo vs. Cobra begins as environmentalist 'One Planet' Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Par√©) to take them to an island in the South Pacific at the beginning Stoddard is Reluctant since the island is a secret military research base, but soon changes its mind when a load of money is offered. Together with TV reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey) they set off for the island and once ashore discover that the military has funded illegal genetic DNA experiments that resulted in huge Komodo Dragon's and King Cobra that ate almost all living things there & Stoddard & co are the next on the menu ... Co-written and directed by the always horrible Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym Jay Andrews, this is simply awful, that's just plain hard to sit on. through & is even worse than the usual 'Creature Features', the Science Fiction Channel has the guts to go on the air if that is possible. The script is terrible, predictable and totally annoying, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists playing with DNA, a group of people are stuck with the monsters and have to try to escape being eaten. That's it, this is the whole plot of Komodo vs. Cobra, maybe this was trying to steal AVP: Alien Vs. Predator (2004) with the title, but all the 'vs.' How many a dislike thirty second standoff between the two headlines in the end, annoying as hell and certainly a big disappointment for someone hoping to have a complete mash in the monster. The character is poor, the dialogue is horrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable and the whole movie sucks a lazy script that wrongly states that both the Komodo Dragon and the Cobra are amphibians and are not. Inferno, Komodo vs. Cobra is not worth watching any unintentional laughter since it is so annoying and almost nothing happens, although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on Cobra beach is pretty funny for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski continue to get direct jobs? He's probably the worst director currently working, how can he keep getting fun movies in pretty places with half decent castings and still produce such a horrible movie? I think this was cut to get a PG or TV, since every time someone swears is masked by a parrot scream! There is no blood or violence and the monsters' scenes are loose, people just stand there, monsters just stand there whistling or roaring, and that's about it. The effects of the CGI computer are terrible, this is very poor thing that looks awful. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 450,000 this seems as cheap as it was, Hawaiian sites are good to look at, but that's about it. The acting is poor of a cast of disinterested appearance. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is an absolutely terrible Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' by Jim Wynorski, the movies do not get much worse than that.
