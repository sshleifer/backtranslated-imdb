I saw this when it came out in theaters in 1996. I remember I was already familiar with the work of Elijah Wood (that's right, he did things before "The Lord of the Rings"!) And the merchandising arrangements with the film were beautiful plentiful (the "Flipper" machine guns were circling). The adults were reminded of the old movies and the TV show, and because of the nostalgia they took their kids to see him, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it was not what anyone expected and it failed severely. You know a movie is in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a bunch of dolphins scare the shark, and the boy - instead of getting out of the water on a boat - floats. in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... Apparently he did not keep in mind that the shark is still out there, maybe even below it. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. He seems old, grumpy and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick. So far, no one remembered "Crocodile Dundee," much less Hogan, and I kind of expected him to suddenly start pretending he did not know what a hair drier was because of fishy laughs out of the water / satire Social. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a very "familiar" movie that is amateurish and almost difficult to watch at times. I hated it when I saw it in theaters in '96 and I hate it more now.
