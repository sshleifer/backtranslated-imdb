I watched this movie a few weeks ago and I must say: I was not impressed at all. I do the same with the other posters when it comes to good acting, but some good acting does not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> In the discussion frame, I found a review of an anonymous poster that captured some of the key points. He says, "Deed Poll" is a film that raises many questions but hardly answers to some, a film that is disturbing and above any attempt at categorization, an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama, despite some shocking scenes. by Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the very impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) compensate for gross holes and some technical flaws (especially in sound), but the boredom that the audience has to deal with for 40 minutes remains. " Unfortunately, this is true. I was not intrigued by the story. The protagonists are cold and unambitious people. They use a lot of drugs and they make lots of sex (incestuous). And? For many times, the direction seemed to be virtually nonexistent, not to mention the technical side: the low sound quality was extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? What is the message behind all this? "The film is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral, and the film is still in the air, without a message. did not take long to see the flaws: for long periods the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the English pronunciation), the character of the mute brother does not develop very well. scene in which the program boy is skinned (the first and only scene of true love) is reached an intensity that the person would love to see the whole movie for a long time.As a spectator, you have to regret the lost chances. " , I must agree. I liked the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer in the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, however, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.) In all, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea - a good and controversial idea wasted - but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with virtually no money. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a seasoned director, that would become a better movie.
