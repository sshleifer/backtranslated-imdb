This is the most boring, pretentious and stupid movie I've seen in a long time. I saw the Academy in Beverly Hills, and there were many people in the lobby who had left the exhibit and sought refuge there. Everyone solemnly shook their heads and appeared to have gone to a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Worse still are the critics who have given this pretentious airship good reviews. What's wrong with them? Are they afraid they will not be considered "hip"? Were they bribed? This movie is unbelievably bad. Do not make a date to expect a deep conversation with the Cheesecake Factory afterwards. If you go to see this movie was your idea, it will frighten you and hold you for the rest of your life.
