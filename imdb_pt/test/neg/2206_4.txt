This was a modest attempt at a movie, although it looked more like an extended TV pilot. <br /> <br /> Some may find this unfair, but it seems that someone has seen "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance." and I thought, "Hey, I could do that too." Well, not completely. <br /> <br /> Although I personally found the film predictable, somewhat misrepresented and planned (watch the cookies), Carl Payne shows that he can take a leading role and that he should be back. On TV. The protagonist (can not remember her name, sorry) was also plausible, but you're still thinking about Julia Stiles (she was the only one in "Save the Last Dance", right?) Because that was really a "white girl" .
