This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of ​​selling some records. Not seriously. The thought behind it is that if you make a movie full of pop music you could put the tracks on an LP, sell it and earn even more money for the studio. You can also release some tracks as singles and merge the promotional video with movie clips so that when MTV plays a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie. This is a good deal, but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about the Hollywood movies of the 1980s and I rate the mid-80s as the art-poorest time for American cinema and FLASHDANCE opened the door for a 90-minute pop video instead of a movie-type movie. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to survive and soon the logic disappears with that career choice. Welding is a very sophisticated trade, not something you enter and learn in five minutes. There are other gaps in logic, like ballet dancing and flashdancing being similar. ie if you sign up to be a ballet dancer and do a hot and dirty flashdancing, male judges may want to meet you after the audition, but you will not get the job. it's like saying screenwriting, novel writing, and playwriting are somehow the same when they're not. <br /> <br /> But I do not think any of that mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie. In fact Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent. Fortunately, I have discovered why her face is well lit up close while her silhouette is dark, taking long pictures except when the camera cuts to the close of her celestial body. That's because a double body is used most of the time and often the double body is a man! I bet there are some transvestite boys who are feeling guilty for not mentioning a bit of disgust at knowing that
