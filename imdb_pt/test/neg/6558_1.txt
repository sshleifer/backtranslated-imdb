Welcome to the movie Plan 9 From Outer Space of Star Trek. Come on, trekkers, admit it. This movie is so bad, so incredibly inefficient in every department, it has become something classic. <br /> <br /> Shat gives the worst performance ever compromised with celluloid. "BOONS! Hi, Bones" Brilliant! This is not just Ham - there are several great pig farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. It must be done under the act of commercial descriptions to use such term. The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Same! Even the Star Trek TV show has improved. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yes, Spock sings Row Row Row his boat. After struggling over the meaning of words !!!! "Capt. Life is not a dream" Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really want to strangle Shatner for this. Could The Shat not have given us his version of Mr. Tambourine Man, or harmonized with Nimoy in Bilbo Baggins's ballad? Very dissapointed. <br /> <br /> A resemblance to Sean Connery plays Spock's half-brother. Just because they could not get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989, it's like watching your drunken grandmother embarrassed at a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> Cat Woman jumps on Shatner's back! Shat spins around her a few times as a WWF Wrestler, and sends her away. Yayy or Shat! It seems that Connery 2.0 was a bit of a rebel Vulcan. Which explains why Spock did not mention it previously in 79 episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently mercifully killed his father, but then they found a cure. Tell me this is not hysterically funny. <br /> <br /> The 11-story Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's anti-gravity boots are supportive of Bones and The Shat as well. Also should have used in on the humpback whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what it claims to be God, but I assume it's actually some kind of alien being. God looks a little like Charlton Heston on the 10 commandments. Sean Connery, the second, asks God to share his pain and die promptly. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a torpedo of photons. I would love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses did to this scene. <br /> <br /> The Shat, having killed God, promptly returns to sing with Spock and Bones. All in all, Row Row Row Your Boat .....
