Do not take this movie seriously, rent it out with some people who want to play Mystery Science 3000, and you'll probably laugh at their slaps. The bad guys are not so scary, it's funny, it's like some 7th grade guy with a scythe on a scarecrow stands up. The acting is hilarious. I love occasional self torture with a poor horror movie and it really made me laugh. I recommend this on this basis. Clear recreational drugs will enhance the experience. Oh, there is a group swimming scene, which will allow some stellar dust in the 5 star system. The black male gets badly injured, but keeps playing and uses the injured part of the body very easily. Enjoy this complete and utter disgrace for movies.
