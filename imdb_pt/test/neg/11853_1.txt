This movie was really terrible. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth seeing as it presents the most unnecessary sex scene in the world. I mean, this thing lasted about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), that's almost 10% of the whole movie! I did not laugh as much as I laughed at this for a long time. <br /> <br /> There were some seriously weird and useless events in this movie, but what I found most funny was when (for no reason) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 orange boys actually rush to the complex near the end. 2 minutes later they leave again. What the heck was that for ?? In addition, the small white forklift that magically turned into a huge yellow digger was quite classic. I'm led to believe this is because they used images from the 'carnossaurus' trilogy to fix this absolute donkey. I'll have to see these now! <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching one or two laughs, but if you do not find funny bad movies, stay away!
