This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it's absolutely the most annoying. Imagine why it is filmed mostly in the dark and especially with Vincent Gallo pulling away from the camera or looking down? Because he does not want to show his face by actually agreeing to be in this movie. I liked his first things, but the pretense of the "Brown Bunny" and then being played that morning knocked him out in my book. And Val Kilmer? I really want to send you a sympathy card. The "doors" to this ??? Actually, the cast was the only reason I watched this movie, and Val does not appear until the movie is halfway there. Simply a sad movie.
