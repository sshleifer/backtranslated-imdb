I will dispense with the obvious revision of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to name. A much shorter list would be what they got right. 1. Face called Noah 2. Ark with animals in it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate picture of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, go rent "The Bible" (1966). He describes the creation story through Abraham trying to sacrifice his son Isaac. It's a much better film, and it may be that the abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) has led you to look for exactly such a film. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really could not bear to see the whole movie. From reading other comments, I can see that even the atheists found it grossly imprecise. As a Christian, it was intolerable to me. Possibly the worst film ever made. No real point for this movie except, perhaps, to show your sub-par animation. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to work well. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says, [28] And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them which are called according to his purpose. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says, [20] But as for you, you think evil against me; but God meant for good, to accomplish, as on this day, to save many living persons. <br /> <br /> In the second example, the brothers of Joseph wanted to kill him, but God turned his evil into a very good good. He may have done the same thing with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so amazed by the lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To find out about Lot and Sodom, they would have to go to Genesis 19 before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Until then, they read almost half of Genesis, so they may want to finish. The next book is Exodus, in which the film "The Ten Commandments" was based (and much more accurately). If they saw this movie, then Exodus becomes an easy read. So now they've read at least two entire books of the Bible, just because they've watched a pathetic movie about Noah's Ark. I'm sure this really happened to someone out there. <br /> <br /> God works in mysterious ways.
