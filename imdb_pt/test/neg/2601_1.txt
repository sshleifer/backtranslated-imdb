this is the most overrated show on television. I believe people continue to watch it because they feel they should because it has become a "cool" spectacle to watch and talk to their friends about the next day at work or at school. seldom really makes more than a laugh and never provokes any sense of irony or thought from the audience. each joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that appear to be drawn from a hat. the complete lack of originality combined with the same disdain he generated (see: American Dad) makes me question the intelligence of an audience that continues to maintain this horrible show on TV. I grant the face of the family without points and may God have mercy on his soul ...
