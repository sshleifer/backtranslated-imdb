Week after week, these women just sweep all the men off their feet. Be real. None of these women are "knockouts." Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) looks like the kind of woman men get: 45 hours before the bar closes, after their vision and their standards have also been hampered by ten or eleven martinis. However, she is the queen bee, a killer of super sexy men. The other three do not do much better. And their constant blunt comments ... not to mention they walk in and out of bed with strange men and never get sick. This program is pathetic and scary. I do not think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women, even though he took Viagra as Tic Tacs while on leave.
