An intelligent general story / location for a story. The action is respectable. Children are annoying and their motivation is not clear. The main villain was a nice change, but it could have been better. "I love you" was more exaggerated than "you complete me," but at least Van Damme had the chance to show a little tenderness. One of Van Damme's best films.
