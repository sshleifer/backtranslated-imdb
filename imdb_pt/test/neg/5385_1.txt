I recently went to a free soap girl show where the filmmakers were present. before the movie they would exhibit themselves, laughing, taking photos. I was excited to see them dressed in real life, and could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the film, the public missed the laugh. It was clear to me that they were not laughing at the picture, but with the picture. this is purely a B grade film without logic behind it. play some nudity, blood and whala! Do you have a movie? <br /> <br /> After the movie I approached a group of filmmakers and asked why they wanted to make this movie. they all acted as seriously as if they were serious filmmakers. each one told me something different: making a controversial movie, a funny movie, an uplifting movie, a socially responsible film. everyone mentioned something different. it became clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making, and now they were trying to make up the money by spreading the movie anyway so people could see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: do not buy into hype! Unless you really have nothing else to do, it may be worth the time for a film student to study how a movie should not be done. otherwise it is best to save two hours of your life.
