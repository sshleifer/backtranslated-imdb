Hard to believe - but it is! I should not be surprised. Commercials try to show how unique and "funny" a program can be. However, the commercials that heralded this new show not only had the least bit of humor for me, but also did not talk to anyone who found the commercials fun. <br /> <br /> I do not remember seeing a pilot so devoid of intelligence, cuteness or humor. The characters were unbearable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair (which is surprising, she would agree to be in a fecal sample of such a program). The few moments in which the characters were slightly redeemable were pretty banal and banal. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show with no quality that can be rescued. And this is not one of them. Kath and Kim have exactly ONE redeeming quality - and it's Selma Blair. Despite wearing disgusting clothes and acting like a pitiful and stupid excuse for a young woman who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still cool to see. <br /> <br /> But if you want to look at Selma, rent the Hellboy. You will at least keep a little respect for her instead of burning that disgusting character in your brain to associate with it. <br /> <br /> In all, Kath and Kim is a waste and really epitomizes the worst that TV is or has ever been. This sets a new low point.
