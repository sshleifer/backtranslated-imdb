Ugh Stephen Baldwin. I never realized until I got the DVD home and I saw his name on the credits. Double ugh. What's worse, it's the name in this low budget, meaningless, wandering, wannabe shoot'em up. I mean, where did they find the guy to write this crap? Driving a caterpillar at LA City Dump while waiting to get into the movie game? The whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on the ridiculous premise. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy of the American Gothic, sans pitchfork. His entire acting repertoire seems like he needs the potty and then it looks like he found it. So there you go: bad script, bad acting by nameless actors, low budget scenario and a hero who is as convincing as a Girl Scout looking for a cookie client as a hero action. It's too late for me to have my money back on the DVD, but you can spare yourself - unless you're one of those who likes to look at dogs for a laugh ... frankly, this one is too boring to be funny.
