I was thrilled with the new synopsis of this film and I look forward to watching it. The first shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where stories happen; the lots of gardening. The movie looks fantastic. Colorful, but simple. Magician still genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go. We quickly discovered that it will be a humorous, manipulative tale, illustrating a group of tired people on their way, confronted by "legally victimized" refugees, who will have a happy ending in which bored people will perceive the error of their ways and accept people. <br /> <br /> The characters, particularly the prejudiced ones, are very "comic" in nature. The story focuses mainly on two families of refugees. One of them is directed by a single mother interpreted of atrocious form by Diveen Henry. I am sad to say that any emotion that might have been felt in relation to their struggles was disarmed for what was a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> The other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. All are marked by their journey to this country by means of containers, where the wife and the mother have died, but it is the husband who suffers most. Benedict Wong does an incredible performance here. At first, his emotions are very subjugated, but as the story unfolds, he subtly makes us aware of the inner struggles of his character. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the film is extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters to follow, many of whom may have potential, but none of them are realized. Worse still, although this movie is not very Hollywood, some of the main plot of the plot is solved cheaply in a Hollywood way. Example: <br /> <br /> The character A likes the character B The character B rejects his advances No problem! Let's have character C declaring his love for character A so that we can all have a happy ending. To yawn. <br /> <br /> I really liked the plot of the Asian family. This was well done. Unfortunately, the entire distribution business, the community aspect, the dynamics involving a large cast are all being explored. <br /> <br /> What remains is a film that has very little value.
