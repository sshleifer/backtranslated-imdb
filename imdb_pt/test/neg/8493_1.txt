I can only imagine how this movie came to be: "So how else can we ruin our careers?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's make a movie that was a great success and make a sequel to it!" <br /> <br /> "Perfect! We're going to have B-level actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. Let's save millions and make a huge profit, no matter the fact that no one wants to see a second-rate sequel with any of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We, as executives, still sincerely believe that a movie was popular based on the name and the story, not the actors who did it in the first place! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find! <br /> <br /> And really, it's how Son Of The Mask can be described. Just a simple B-grade movie that tries to suck life. However, if the film did not contain the words "mask", or anything to do with the mask, it would be a great movie for children. Horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It's a humorous movie that really wants to scream "like me!" But only those 8 and younger will actually have fun. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only one He is clearly trying to make the stuff work, playing the desperate dad, but the script is so bad, the only thing worth it was my drink after to see this. "Loki's character also deserves to be mentioned, as he was the nicest character and really one of the only reasons for the older adults to see this movie. It's very bad the charac. On this film, I would have liked very much to have seen the character take on the real mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and bathroom humor near the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so much by the books that I will not bother mentioning it here. It's all so obvious that even a Disney executive would be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this is going to DVD in three months from what it seems. Shame on the studios to again spot a decent movie with a horrible sequel. Was not it stupid and dumberer to teach them anything?
