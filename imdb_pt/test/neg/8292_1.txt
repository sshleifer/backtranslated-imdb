Although I've been a long-time fan of Shatner (since watching the Trek replay during dinnertime in the early 1970s), I can not think of any possible reason why he wanted to make this movie, whether for personal development or reasons of business. Did he lose a bet? <br /> <br /> As a movie fan, I like to enjoy the bad movies along with the great movies. But "Shoot or Be Shot" has no talent or funny parts, unintentional or not. <br /> <br /> While it has not been evaluated, there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you will lose nudity, caricato shooting "violence" with endless bullet gunfire), then we are led to believe that the producers simply wanted to save the rate needed to get the MPAA to rate it. This will make your way to the cable with only 10 seconds edited. <br /> <br /> Of the eight people who were in the theater with us, four of them left halfway, mumbling statements like "This is stupid." Shatner plays a mental patient who escaped and was denied release because he sees himself as a screenwriter. The bank examined his request "INSANE". He comes across a group of Z-level filmmakers who "film on video because it's 80 percent cheaper than a movie" and decides to force them to film their script under the gun's sights. There are some small subplots that develop some of the minor characters, but for the most part, this is the entire movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes on an "art" Shatner movie, see "Free Enterprise" instead, it's a much better movie.
