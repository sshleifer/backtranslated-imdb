I wish it was "Last Dumb Thriller". But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical and often irritating. They desperately want to be taken seriously, but what is there to take seriously about a child's behavior or the plot of a thriller? Having seen this child in private - I mean ... thriller - I understand why critics refer to it as "a Hitchcockian thriller"; they might as well call "idiot", because that's what "hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (look, if you do not believe me). Even the soundtrack is old Hollywood, which is a mistake: it does not fit into a movie from the late 70's and makes it look fake. Also, how dare you steal the idea of ​​stealing from De Hitchcock? The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is dead and her killers are never a problem. Instead, his former employers first follow him and then decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? Without explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark and somber organization ("X-Files"), it is very happy to bring down its former employees on grounds of pension funds. Or maybe it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to discover the mystery logically by assuming there is a great conspiracy, in reality the killer is ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman who occupies Scheider's quarters; the one who briefly suggested that she was "depraved." Why is she going after Scheider precisely at a time when her wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own former employers - and not a few years before or a few years after his wife's murder? A pure hitchcockian (look again in the dictionary, in case you have forgotten what it means) coincidence. How about this brilliant reason for her ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution as a 15-year-old virgin in NY, and later sycophant by a bunch of horny Jews, one of whom-tah-dah! - It's Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin has thrown a prostitute in her spare time (among other things) in order to kill all the descendants of men who so cruelly syphilized her once virginal grandmother. As hitchcockian (look up) is this? The ending then blatantly rips the Mount Rushmore scene from "North By Northwest," except that love interest is a killer and it is not saved. <br /> <br /> The film also offers some dodgy / off dialogue -kilter and some not so great acting. Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider in the cemetery. Let us not forget Napier's idiotic device, which took his jacket and held his hand with suspicion - but it was not a weapon! How brilliant! Napier in the Tower: There are now another set of illogical behavioral patterns. J. Demme was, is and always will be a director without style, without talent, and the man who directed "Philadelphia." Let's give another Oscar!
