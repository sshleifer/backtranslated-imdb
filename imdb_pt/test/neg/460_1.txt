Alien was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst alien copy. Because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scene and other bad things (it would take about 3 pages to tell you everything that is bad about this movie.) The movie was not very long and this is a very good thing. you can laugh because it's too serious ... this is a bad thing because in almost every science fiction film in the B series, you can laugh all the time.It may be great sometimes, but watch this stupidity, just watch Alien or Event Horizon ... these are much better !!! I give it 1 out of 5.
