Overrated Mafia comedy. Director Demme makes the actors stop after a few funny phrases to let the audience laugh, not lose the next line. It seems strange - this director made "Silence of The Lambs" - now there is a way to use breaks! Casting seems off. Mathew Modine too young for the FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell is doing a Jack Nicholson thing with a strabismus, and he gets an indication for it! Besides, do we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a Mafia lawyer are underutilized with just one line each - they should be clumsy hoods. Chris Isaak's soundtrack is totally out of place - better for a movie like "Pretty In Pink". Re-make this movie, it's worth it, but with the right cast and director and the satire will come ... even the repeated "Forgedaboutit."
