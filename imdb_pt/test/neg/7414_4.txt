Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I'm not inclined to watch them. However, there were some good commercials on The Sci-Fi Channel, so I decided to watch. A climbing expedition moves to the Pacific Northwest to find a fallen plane carrying the daughter of the expedition leader (played by Lance Hendrickson), and brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence of sasquatch. And that really does generate some suspense in the beginning. The sasquatch is invisible, but it sees the heat of the body of the climbers (like the alien in "Predator"), and I wondered when it was going to attack. The performance is passable, as is the background music. The dense wooded site is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the fantasy is not bad, though nothing good. But as the film continues, it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd. Most of the characters are nasty people, rude to one another and only on the money and publicity expedition (except for Lance Hendrickson's character), so it's impossible to care what happens to them. And their behavior becomes increasingly stupid. A man shoots the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. A female camper wore a silk dressing gown just before she slipped into her sleeping bag, then narrowly escaped being dragged into the woods by the goldfish, without making her hair and make-up messy. So survivors conclude that sasquatch is actually behind the DNA detection machine and will let them live if they leave behind ("a creature knows what threatens it"). Obviously, instinct does not apply to these actors, or they would not have appeared in this film. And the end is so stupid that you will want to kick the TV screen. If it had not been for the script, it would have been a decent horror film.
