My opinion: usually routine and lazy straight to the Disney video attempt. <br /> <br /> Disney must have fallen in love with the tradition of family cinema that is the family dog. Many films have focused on stories that focus solely on man's best friend. Disney herself made a handful. They also made a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add this one to this bunch. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the original for a long time, so I'm probably not the right person to judge if this sequel gets better. Anyone over seven years old is not the right person to see it either. Maybe only the youngest of the youngsters would want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP's adventure, and even they would grow up to say it was not the best kind of family entertainment they've ever seen. I think to be fair, I can say is that this guarantees a lease, but that does not have much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequence virtually picks up the pieces left behind after the original so-called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of gorgeous Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and a mischievous crossbreed named Scamp, which is a chip from the old block. Instead of the boundaries of the house, Scamp wants to run away with the other dogs in the city, unknown to his father's past as one of those mutts on the streets. To capture the charms of the original, this launches in the same love story of the poor dog / rich dog, vice versa. Scamp falls in love with one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who would not do it with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). What a replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Aside from the "cuddly" factor, there's nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straightforward video effort. Keep the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
