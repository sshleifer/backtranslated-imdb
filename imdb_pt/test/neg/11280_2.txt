I gave this 2 stars a possible 10. <br /> <br /> I went into it without realizing what it was - and found it to be some kind of African musical - as long as people start singing in a few minutes. none of the songs rhyme, most of them are not saying anything sensible, and they all have the same melody nonexistent - if you could call it "melody". <br /> <Karmen is a tall, spectacular young woman with the largest braids I have ever seen. [The actress looks like she probably did some modeling]. <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a female prison, although it's not like a prison I've seen or heard about - the inmates use anything they desire - and it seems to be having a party. Karmen does some frantic dancing, and the prison director, Angelique, [a magnificently beautiful woman] is definitely interested in erotic terms. She and Karmen dance together. Later Karmen visits the director's bedroom and they make love - unfortunately the scene is not detailed, and is very short, although there is some nudity. Karmen then escapes from prison and then we see her dancing in front of another group where a man, named Lamine, maybe a colonel - was never clear who he was, watch her. He has a young woman who does not like Karmen's seductive dance and there is a dance between the two women. <br /> <br /> After that, the story [as it is] becomes even more confusing. <br /> <br /> With Lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> There are more songs. More dance, and a scene of Angelique, obviously suffering from heartbreak. <br /> <br /> The movie comes to an end, and I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over. <br /> <br /> <br />
