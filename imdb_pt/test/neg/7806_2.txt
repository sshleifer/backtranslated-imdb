This movie is about the worst I've seen in a long time. Terence Stamp's talent is totally wasted and the only thing I liked was listening to a favorite song, "If I Had a Million Dollars" from BNL, in opening credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a cool guy who gets tied up at home sitting to his boss. Misadventures happen. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and have nothing better to do then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, watch something else. <br /> <br /> There are not necessarily moments of redemption, but it's good to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor onscreen. They are always pleasurable to watch, although this movie has managed to cushion even these bright spots.
