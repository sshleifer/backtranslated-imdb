This movie reminded me a lot of a Dead Kennedys song called "Straight A's". However, unlike this film, the hero of DK's music turns into suicide. You will wish this bozo has resorted to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did. The whole thing was complicated and in the beginning, you sympathize with the hero of the film, so he quickly betrays his sympathies. The long sequences of just showing the hero's face while he does a monologue drag the movie down a bit. Avoid this if possible.
