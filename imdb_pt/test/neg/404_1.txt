I watched this movie based on the comments of some who said it was bad, but funny. But you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They make the science fiction films of the 1950s look like works of art. That's funny at times, but annoying for the most part. And to complicate the problem with seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized most of the events described. One of my favorites is where three of the characters fall hundreds of meters into a tunnel created by the Arachnee and arrive to find it fully lit. Apparently, the arachnid also got into the power grid. Very impressive. But this is just an example. And for what it's worth, music sucks, acting sucks, the two pretty girls are annoying, the obnoxious guy is annoying, the so-called handsome man is a nerd, and the black girl who falls in love with him is a fool. Her father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure if the brief moments of humor can outweigh the experience.
