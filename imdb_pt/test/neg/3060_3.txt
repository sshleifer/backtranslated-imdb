That's kind of called a "fictionalized" account of the Barker gang. They have the right names, but that's about it. Russell is still hot, I'll guarantee this, but this is not the real Ma Barker, who basically took care of the boys cooking and cooking. helping when they moved around the country, not planning or participating in the crimes. I think it would have been much more interesting to present the true story of a middle-aged woman caught up in the criminal activities of her children and her comrades. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with those reviewers that I find the shooting scenes totally unbelievable. The Barker / Karpis victims were a combination of innocent and law enforcement agents who chased them, but they definitely did not kill half a dozen FBI agents every time they were cornered. (On the other hand, as several recent books have reported, the FBI at that time emphasized the idea of ​​agents coming only from legal or accounting funds, as many agents had very little experience in law enforcement or firearms. which we imagine today. <br /> <br /> But the worst of all is that the film is basically boring. <br /> <br /> Nobody changes, no one grows. <br /> <br /> We know that the end of the road is ahead, we do not know what the shooting will be. /> <br /> Just for Russell's fans.
