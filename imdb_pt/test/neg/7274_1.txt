Sir, this sucks. There is a particular kind of sex revolution film from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual aggression with sexual liberation. This movie is an example. I've lost track of how often women are slapped, beaten, whipped or beaten in the film. And then there are all the times that women in the movie fantasize about being slapped, beaten, whipped or beaten (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it is ostensibly part of the game fetish insurance. Other times this clearly is not, but you will wait in vain to see the heroine denounce the authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we can hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to "let go." <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie smells of misogyny (talking like a white man, married and in his 30s). not the studies of lesbian teenage women with a chip on the shoulder, so you do not get the wrong idea. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the good thing about this movie is that it provides a reminder of how bad things really were for women just a few decades ago.
