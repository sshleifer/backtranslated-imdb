It seems to be common in the 1990s to play with clichés. Some can do it with great talent. Hervé Hadmar did not. On paper, the film seemed interesting: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humor and a very "décalé" style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing, because no one reacts in the theater. The film is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they are doing in this ridiculous mascarade. What could have been a dull and elegant comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.
