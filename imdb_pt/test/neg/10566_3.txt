A huge alien monster falls on the Earth and then destroys the population using his laser beam to dissolve almost all the humans he sees (that is, when his aim is not terribly off) and then his naked claws with which he likes to pluck and eat the human spleen! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very silly thing. I have to give a few points for being a little fun sometimes. I really enjoyed the stupid lightning gun battle in the beginning and some of the top gore effects. However, it does not help when the monster provides the truly fun moments of the movie and it is not on the screen for much of the movie running time. The acting in this whole process is simply horrible and amateur, and our main hero, Sheriff Cinder, is very unattractive to be the hottest girl in the movie. I also have to take points to blatantly copy THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) on several occasions. When the monster is not in a turmoil, NIGHTBEAST is very annoying and eventually its attacks become so repetitive and predictable that they become less amusing. See this back to back with THING 1951 and see the characterization of difference, attention to plot and details and creation of suspense for a monster in the loose movie.
