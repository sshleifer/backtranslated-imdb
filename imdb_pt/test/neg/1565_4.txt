This adaptation contains two parts: 1. The "now" moment when Gulliver is at home in England and is soon placed in an insane asylum by the evil Dr. Bates 2. The " described, "in which Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> Times are interspersed with a very hectic pace, which makes the suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the film simply discarded that part and we followed the book as it is written. In the book, there is no Dr. Bates, no asylum, and Mrs. Gulliver receives very little mention. Journeys - in the plural - are portrayed as one in the film. There are several films covering the subject of healthy people dumped in asylum by some nasty person out there, look at them if you want those things. The "now" part of the time adds nothing to the value of the story, it is a complete invention of movie adapters and takes valuable time from the real story. During all this time, I longed for the next actual voyage to be exhibited. <br /> <br /> So much for the inconveniences. The parts that really are part of the real story are well done, and the CGI is really well done for your time. Many small parts (and some medium-sized ones) of actual travel are simply cut off, but that does not stop the story. This is AFAIK the only version that portrays the four trips, and for that the film should receive a special mention. <br /> <br /> The two merged parts receive approximately the same time. I rate the first part from 0 to 10, and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. Average, I give a 4/10. If only they had cut the trash and focused 99% on the actual trips, since that cut would have released much better time spent in filling the details of the trips. <br /> <br /> Why do some adapters think he's talented enough to improve Swift's work, I do not know. My best guess is that CGI was so expensive in 1996 that the film company felt the need to incorporate too much filler that did not need elaborate sets, GCI, etc., in order to keep the total costs below some threshold, while at the same time producing a mini-series that recorded a certain number of minutes.
