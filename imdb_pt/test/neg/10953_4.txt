Back in Movie Gallery, I saw a movie that I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror / action / western that I could get into. Yes, I knew it would be bad, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughter. Only a few laughs were found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It starts with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in movie history. He looks / acts like he could face Chuck Norris, but he can not. Your dialogue sucks too. Anyway, he walks into a village, shoots some zombies. You could say that they tried to do this longer by putting on those boring scenes where it takes 3-5 minutes to recharge or watch some zombies. At least zombies seem cool. Anyway, some people are shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead, except for our main character, who should have died early when he was shot by four people.
