Oh gosh! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was very disappointed in that. I was thinking .... A Steven Seagal movie! Nice! We'll see him kick people and turn people and break bones. We can even see him fight someone! Great! <br /> <br /> However, I was on a rude awakening. This movie can be summarized as follows: Take an episode of A-Team, remove the amiable characters and rogues like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. So ask a writer / director to write a plot that even Ed Wood would be ashamed of and that he is too fan of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Play a lot of people with bad acting skills who do not have real names. Finally, add a main star that is getting flaccid around the navel and does not seem to be able to do its own action scenes anymore. <br /> <br /> The result? Half dead. An action film so ridiculous that at least made me smile well on the way. The plot holes are incredibly large - for example, prisoners who, when the chain is invaded, fight the invaders instead of trying to escape. Or how about the arrest itself, which has an arsenal that contains heavy machine guns and grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (with a striking resemblance to a Huey) with some sort of video game machinegun mounted on the nose. <br /> <br /> Then there's Seagal himself. I like the guy. He can fight. He is even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But all through the movie I was waiting for that great and definitive fighting scene. Never happened. Instead, we got people firing guns and not reaching an entire hell. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow aisle and you shoot a submachine gun at them, there are not many places where bullets can go beyond the aisle and into the target. However, do they somehow miss it? Even team A would be frightened by such nonsense. And when it comes to any kind of physical face-to-face, we're treated to a despicable Theft of Matrix, without the benefit of bullet time. People being kicked in the air and other ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> Come on Steven, you're better than that. Your career can not end. Say it is not so! <br /> <br /> This is instantly forgettable (except that I'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you watched it, try to find it fun in an A-Team way. But I doubt it's on anyone's "re-watchable" list. Out for justice this is not. More like outside at lunch.
