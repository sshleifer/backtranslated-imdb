The performance rate is better than the one I gave to this job, simply because I will not support a movie that shows any child or mentally ill person how to get, cook and inject narcotics into their bodies. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting movie, which serves no purpose in the world, but to glamorize and try to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It has convincing performances that add to my disgust. What were these people thinking ?! I could not enjoy a movie like this. It's enough to make someone who has never used drugs, think about it, and those who have redeemed themselves, consider reversal. I'm surprised you do not make all the clean addicts see you, get out of the car. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this "movie" that stands out more as a document How To Get Strung Out. This is the epitome of what's wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> The price is 1.3 / 10 of the ... <br /> <br /> The Demon:.
