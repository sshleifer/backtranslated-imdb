Jack Higgins' direct thriller about an IRA bomber charged with guilt forced to "one last job" (where have I heard this plot before?) Gets a sarcastic treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with an alarming red hair, confesses everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The church rules prevent Father Bob from speaking, but Rourke falls in love with his father's blind niece. They attach themselves to the church organ. What? Really, this is the plot. Alan Bates is the main dog mafioso who is giving the letters (literally) and he seems to be the only actor who is in the playful tone that Hodges is looking at. Bates is ready to make a kind of PRIZZI HONOR, but no one else, including a charismatic Liam Neeson in a supporting role, was told.
