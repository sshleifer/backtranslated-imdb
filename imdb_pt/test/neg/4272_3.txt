I always try not to be hard to criticize something I did not like, but after watching this miniseries I was so disappointed that I could not avoid my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained true to the novel and of course I found very good, but on the other hand, the terrible cast, bad acting, especially of key characters ?? like Funny Price, theatrical staging impression, I mean, the theatrical way of acting makes you irritate yourself from beginning to end. I'm sure that with this budget, even if it were low, something much better and more valuable could have been done. it's up to you to watch this series, but personally I do not advise you to spend your time in this disappointing setting.
