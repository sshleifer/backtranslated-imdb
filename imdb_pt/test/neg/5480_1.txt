This game was terrible. I think they worked a lot in the visual and did not do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the looks look awesome, but is the game really "fun"? NOT! I mean, it's like, "Hey, let's jump over buildings" and all I'm doing is hold and A / X. The game is not there, and I do not agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this hot girl producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like, "OK, we have this hot girl, let's meet her," and if you go to game sites, you will not see Assassin's Creed gameplay stuff, you'll see her face with a microphone and it will be like "We interviewed Jade Raymond about his favorite cookies!" It's like the man, shut the F * @ K UP WHO CARES ?! Apparently ... a lot of people do, because they bought the game and liked it ... I mean, compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that does not really abuse the Wii Remote, but is still very innovative and delivers on the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a little bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still impressive, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing, and this is a game that deserves game of the year. Assassin's Creed, dude, does not even deserve to be a NOMINEE for the Game of the Year. The hype around this game where was like "oh is the next generation of games" ... really? I think not! So let me get this straight because I think people who like this game are just liking it because they're Jade fans, so I'll tell you guys, JADE WILL NOT DO IT WITH YOU OR SOMETHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME! If you want a REAL game on PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games too), and if you want a REAL game on all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, by pressing two buttons to do all these cool things, is it really a fun game? The only reason other games make it more complicated is because afterwards it turns out to be more innovative and fun. And this game is not that. 1.3 / 10 A HELL ALIVE!
