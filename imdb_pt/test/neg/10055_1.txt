The veteran TV director, Ted Post, treats us of a drawn, confused and meaningless story taken from Harold Robbins' B Column Big Book Of Plots. Against a Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies anchors, Jaclyn Smith, take the direction of a star as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times," while James Franciscus, JFK's imitator, relaxes on the sidelines. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly overshadowed by Sybil Danning until a giallo style ends the whole sad mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and Bob Mitchum is there too. Somewhere.
