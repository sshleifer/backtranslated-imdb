Default "Outbreak of disease in remote area; expert who happens to be holiday in the area takes control" movie. There are only a few deviations from the norm. One is that the kids involved are very reasonable from the start. Usually they are monsters that repeatedly mess up jobs until they are redeemed at the end. Another is that the local healer / healer, who is usually an impediment from the beginning, is never completely discounted or rescued at the end. Perhaps, since this seems to have been done for the faith-oriented PAX channel, they did not want to sound too critical about the faithful. Finally, there was no great local politician in the leisure world trying to cover the whole thing. The lack of such stereotypes was invigorating - if we have the PAX channel to thank for it, maybe I have to try some more of their offerings. Aside from that, however, this was quite normal. You've seen it all before.
