This movie was awful. If it had never been done, the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying car? What were they thinking? This was an under-par movie with a horrible hook, and I would like an apology in writing from the studio that produced this along with some cookies to help me pay for the time I lost in this crap fest I can never go back. If you paid to see this movie, I'm really sorry because I watched it on TV one Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my entire week. A flying bum?!?! And is it to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own needs than her children? No wonder they do not have the sense to tell someone that he's beating them, their mother teaches nothing unless what she wants comes first. Absolutely awful.
