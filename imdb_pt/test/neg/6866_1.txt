The concept is excellent. Execution typifies the overall quality of the ABC network. <br /> <br /> In addition to Peter Jones, it appears that the rest of the panel consists of marketing executives. rather than real business people. <br /> <br /> When I realized that Peter Jones was joining Simon Cowell, my initial thoughts were wow, he'll get America by the balls. But it seems that ABC came and destroyed the concept. I was an absolute addict of the Den Dragons in the UK and was interested to see that Peter Jones had manipulated the concept that originated in Japan and developed his own show for the states. The result is neither inspirational nor informative. <br /> <br /> If you have no drama in your life, do you have a choice now? Jerry Springer or the American Inventor In a nutshell: a musician struggling to sell to a media mogul. <br /> <br /> Idea: get me! And I'm going to produce a show worthy of the title
