After all the hype I had heard about Jane Austin's novel and different movie versions of the book, I was very disappointed with the movie. I expected a classic drama, but that was not the case. First of all, let me begin my analysis with the fact that I love old films, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not women-oriented films. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my comment with a big grain of salt. I thought the acting was a little overdone, but that's very common in the films of that era. June Allyson was good as Jo, but I thought all the sisters were stereotyped and formed. There were no surprises or overly dramatic moments. I hate writing negative reviews, but the movie made me very cold. It has always been my intention to read the book, but after that it seems unlikely. The only story line of warming up was between the old gentlemen and the younger sister which was a welcome plus point in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. Again there are others who love this movie, I'm not just one of them.
