A woman in love with her husband (he is suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She went to a fertility clinic - like the mistress she takes - then they both know how artificial insemination works; but instead of using the method that thousands of people use every year around the world (the $ 5 peru), they engage in intercourse. We must also believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancee, he does not suggest the obvious alternative to the sexual act. Also, although this is a business arrangement, the first time she's with her sperm donor, she takes off all her clothes, as if it were a seduction. In addition, the husband does not realize when $ 30,000 is missing from his bank accounts. Does all this seem to require more suspension of disbelief than most things in Hollywood? Far fetched on all fronts.
