I do not understand how this crap hit the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie! It was unbelievable, me and a group of friends decided to attend tonight and it was the dumbest thing any of us have ever seen, I could not believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes of total admiration that someone really thought about it and then turned it into a movie. Are they in crack? My guess is yes, in large doses. I doubt very much that anyone might like this crap. Is this to be science fiction or comedy or what? I do not think the idiots who made it care, they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many idiots they could fool and watch. Well, we put something in the movie, so let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf - no, no, no. This is not a movie. The acting is like watching wooden dolls moving around and reading a book, that's how bad it is. I feel like going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back, no one should have to put up with this crap. So I'm here to warn you - DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen!
