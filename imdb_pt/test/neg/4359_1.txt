Suburban children find the forest. Killjoy is better off in this part. He is more perverse and stronger as well. However, most of the acting is bad as well, as in the first. Sometimes the characters say things to each other that make no sense and are not convincing. I made a mistake to see this sober. You'll probably like it more if you're not ;-). If you have not stopped loving clowns after the first movie, you definitely will after the second ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Troubled children and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the woods. And what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of a forest and ... at night? That's just your luck. They find a house and one gets shot, one of the watchers stays behind (because I do not know) and the rest eventually find another house. In that house lives a voodoo priestess ..... but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. Who is it then? Well, you better watch the movie and find out for yourself ....
