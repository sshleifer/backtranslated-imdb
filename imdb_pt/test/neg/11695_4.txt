As far as Asian horror is concerned, I have seen my share of disappointments along with some of the scariest imaginings ... "Acacia" does not really qualify for any of these categories. There were some moments of tension and it was interesting to watch, but I could not help thinking that there should be a little more in this story. The film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a child who seems to have a fascination for trees. He develops a bond with the Acacia tree in his backyard and seems to communicate with it. Then, during a fight with his mother, involving his new son, he moves away after threatening to find his dead mother, who is now a tree. When he does not return, the parents send a report and wait, while the neighbor believes that he somehow inhabits the Acacia tree. The pace is quite slow and the ending gets a bit strange, but I have to recommend it as a rather pleasant endeavor, although the story seems a little annoying. Hell, I can not decide on this ...
