The restrained and pessimistic Peter Watkins goes to the other side of the ocean to confront the American justice system around 1971 with this invaluable zeitgeist paranoia that relies so far. Watkins is a pure tourist as he gathers this gang tragedy with abnormal cliches, hippies and black revolutionaries placed against police and military police and a kangaroo court made up of disapproved and calcified adults making bad fashion statements. Talk about a revolution. <br /> <br /> In Punishment Park, we have radical youngsters versus a corrupt system, as convicted dissidents are given a choice of jail or a three-day journey through Punishment Park and freedom. Of course, law enforcement officers who monitor their journey are not about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat that the fate of our protagonists seems sealed. <br /> <br /> Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in the scene and also in the theme. . The trials are held under a large canvas tent, where the prisoners scream in defiance of unconditional love or leave a group of inquisitors (as members of Silent Majority for Peaceful America) screaming back. Neither group spends a lot of time listening to the other, and the proceedings take over a teenage parent row over the car's visual keys. Mostly it's just one side saying what's wrong with America's other saying what's right with no one offering solutions to change. Meanwhile, the martyrs of Punishment Park stumble endlessly over dessert, while gunslingers act like 12-year-olds. He kind of looks like some of my college years doing a movie class when we were younger and we knew more than we do now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the oppressed and the common man against what he perceives as a powerful few corrupt. Culledon was a strong accusation of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. The war game is a sober look at the nuclear consequences that must be seen for all. Punishment Park also has its value, but for another reason than not intended. Watkins's view today is a classic example of the left in paranoia against the culture of the 1970s and, given the times (Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7), this strident hysteria did not seem so far from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever has subsided and Punishment Park, with its narrow and unrestricted view, is a very silly ride.
