A real disappointment, the novel is a journey of making a stomach so bright and maddening, but this is absurd and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has ever made a glossy version of this book, Kubrick says on the cover, he should have assumed the reins of this. Stacey Keach is too sentimental like Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values ​​as the 1970s TV, Planet Of The Apes. I completely recommend that you go out and buy many Jim Thompson novels, but in fact The Grifters is not too bad, that's one of them, starring Jon Cusak.
