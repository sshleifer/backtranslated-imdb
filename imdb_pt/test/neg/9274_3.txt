The film has a good story, the action is good in some parts, but not in all of them. Some of the parts, I just felt like the bad guys would not have dosed yet, from my experience of taking Martial Arts. Some are actions are long, as always mainly for the boss, but for the less important, they were dead or dosed with some hits, but some were quite unrealistic or could have done a better job on. <br /> <br /> The less important actors or stunts were the right choices for the movie, my girlfriend started having a crush on them as she started watching the movie more than she spends the time with me. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, that's all I can say.
