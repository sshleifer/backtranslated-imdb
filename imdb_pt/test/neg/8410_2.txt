With its few surrealistic touches, the LWHTRB functions as a low-level terror, but as a great statement accompanying the original, it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Things get a little promising during the opening credits of the TV movie. We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: the baby's black cradle with the inverted cross; the kitchen knife that Rosemary took to Castevette's apartment and fell into shock (the utensil is shown coming out of the wooden floor); and the void of Bramford himself, without renters or furniture (voices can be heard here in the dialogue of the previous film). Also interesting is the Easter egg hunt that the attending child participates in (eggs and baskets are also black). Once the story begins to roll, it never "rolls" ... And what about Rosemary when she boards that bus without a driver and is taken to God-knows-where? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a poor replacement for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (as the Southwest prostitute raising the child, "Adrian / Andrew") lead this star cast with Ruth Gordon reprising her role as "Minnie." <br /> <br /> Although not a total failure, this sequel should have been released in the first place, so maybe we could all have been a little better informed ... and not left totally in the dark. A recent sequel novel "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate follow-up of Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
