The satirical movie site Dateline Hollywood joked that "Son of the Mask" was a stunt prank that Jamie Kennedy played at New Line Cinema for her show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment". If only. And if only the movie had been as funny as that piece of satire. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for Jim Carrey, who attracted many viewers; He also charmed men over 12 years old by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a less followup was not a good idea, and you would have thought that New Line would have learned the lesson after "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd." But no ... although to be fair, having a whole new cast is in keeping with the original comic book (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman, however, there is nothing there in return except a steady flow of FX decently acceptable by the usual squad of houses (Industrial Light and Magic improving the baby dancing "Ally McBeal" and himself "Baby's Day Out" with Studio Tippett, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on) and an even greater pleasure for comic book fans for having our hero working in an animation company (responsible for such jewelry as "Siamese Popes "), naming his character after Tex Avery, and working not only on references to classic drawings, but on actual clips. The problem is that the latter approach does not really work, in part because most attempts to bring cartoon traps to live action fall flat (especially cars getting into the party mood) and mainly because the tributes to Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" show how weak this film is in comparison. In addition, the film fits into shambolic clowning alongside tense feeling (the underlying theme of the story is the family; our hero is not ready to have a child, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Nordic god Loki - is far from be Odin's eye girl ... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin, even after "Super Mario Bros.", is beyond me), and Kennedy is not in the same league as Carrey on the crazy stakes - though do not be like it gets any help from the script. Note also that, unlike Diaz, the very handsome Traylor Howard (like the son of the mask's son) does not have much to do; Giving the mask may have helped the movie. <br /> <br /> More points are lost by throwing out Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously abridged execution time (which would explain some plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inner joke when our hero can not sell the concept of the "green face" as an animated TV series - "The Mask" has become an animated TV series in real life, and it was much better to follow than this sequel. The fact that this really opened up in Britain before the United States should tell you everything ... and with that and "Blade: Trinity," New Line seems determined to corner the market in horrific sequels with cast members of " Two Guys And A Girl ". "What next," The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone stop it.
