The movie was not really that bad, especially in terms of plot, but the actor (and hairy!) Who they chose for the lead role was a little colorful in the acting department. I would have chosen someone else. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was very ingenious, and the main character questioning everything he had ever known made him rather kind, but not so much when there was a doughy bubble for a main actor. <br /> <br /> The plot was interesting. This raises the question of how the subject of cloning will be treated in the future. Certainly cloning would not be allowed for the purposes of the film, but it is still a valid argument to this day. Clones are still people ... right? <br /> <br /> The film was not particularly special, but still much better than some of the cheeses launched during the 1970s. Let's not forget the "Giant Spider Invasion". I give 4, as it does not TOTALLY stink, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You'll like this movie but it will not be your favorite.
