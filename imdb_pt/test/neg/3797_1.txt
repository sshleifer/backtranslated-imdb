4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great character actors, Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour and 54 minutes of pure boredom, melodrama and horrible acting, a script mess, and a sinking feeling of the good God, what were they thinking? <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen was just trying to profit from the popularity of the original classic disaster film with a less D note script, the actors were obviously only in it for the paycheck too, , the horror! <br /> <br /> How insane are the characters that Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field are playing? Go on a potentially deadly sinking ship that is 1. flaming 2. Hot steam 3. Slippery water and oil, 4. Boilers that are exploding every 5 minutes, etc., all for the sake of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, much less a hook, rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle outgrows so much that I just wanted to hit him! Stop this! And what's wrong with the bad wig? Also, there is no way to believe that his character was a World War II veteran. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden find all that gold and money and they're happy - whoopee! They were rich! (We may not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yee haw, it's the great character actor Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors in abundance! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight, too! <br /> <br /> The final dramatic sub-plot on that scary plutonium has never been anywhere, it's as if they've forgotten, like? Lots of holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This film has a disease that the strongest pill can not cure. I'm surprised that the name of Alan J. Smithee was not in the script, I would be ashamed to have written this one! <br /> <br /> Oh, insanity, Oh, mankind! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> The Horror, the Horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad two-hour movie on TV. <br /> <br /> At least the sets were made of recycled material. material from the first film. <br /> <br /> The script needed to be in the compost heap ...
