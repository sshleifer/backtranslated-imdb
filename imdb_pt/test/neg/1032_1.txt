Although the numbers are higher in proportion to other areas of society, I am not opposed to the extremely high salaries of many of today's artists and athletes. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron or Brady also have deals. well with 8 figures, or the low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could truly become billionaires of their shows, huge waste and fees they currently demand. Even the cast members, and the whole group of "Friends" reached close to or more than 7 figures per episode. Letterman's earnings for a show could solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two will take care of many for life. <br /> <br /> But all of this is based on solid supply / demand principles, and the financial benefits they bring to their employers. And all perform their crafts skillfully. <br /> <br /> But then comes someone like Rachel Ray, who achieves a level of gains far beyond any apparent level of talent or ability. I find it strident, annoying, and with a forced perkiness that is as false as the proverbial "$ 3 bill." <br /> <br /> A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for your company and its affiliates. One of the top talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $ 5-10K level, for a handful who gets $ 200,000 or more per presentation. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams and, no kidding, Larry the Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There are numbers in the range of $ 100,001 to $ 200,000; The list included the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even cable broadcaster Larry, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I suppose I have to admit that there may be enough demand for your "talent" and offers to justify your talk show and there may be some out there who pay over $ 100K , + first-class air, hotel suite, all expenses and door-to-door Limus for just a few hours of your whiny gossiping in the event of your organization. <br /> <br /> I just can not understand how this can be possible.
