I came out of this movie and did it only once before with the Australian film Sweetie, about 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt like killing the cameraman and simply could not believe that this movie really popped up anywhere and - guess what - was nominated for two independent awards at the Spirit Awards. What???? How can the dialog box be realistic (I will NEVER use the word "guy" again!) - who wants to hear these conversations? I do not go to the movies to piss me off, but that's all I have. The only good thing I got out of was the realization that if this movie could reach Sundance and other festivals, anyone could go. Well, wait, this may not be a good thing after all ...
