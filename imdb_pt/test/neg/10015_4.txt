The earth was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a bunch of pure-blood survivors - those without radioactive contamination - are hiding in a huge mansion surrounded by lush gardens, waiting for the next opportunity to hunt down those with polluted blood. . The Final Executioner is the story of one of them would be victim, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, much like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to overthrow the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan was trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam (Woody Strode), who usually stands by giving moral support to his pupils and provoking meat poo. Strode is by far the best thing about the movie, although it does not look too good and only appears for about a third of the run time. As for the story, it's a mix of elements from best movies and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game and Escape From New York. The final executor moves at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminating action fans.
