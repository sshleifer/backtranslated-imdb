My brother-in-law and his wife brought the film during one night to watch video. That should have given me the first clue that it would be awful. That was it. From the first frame to the last one, this movie is terrible. It is not even recorded as a "B" movie. Maybe an N or a P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. From the rubber raptor on a stick to the corpses that still breathe in the car to the horrible closing lines, this movie is not worth watching if you got it for free. <br /> <br /> Skip this completely - unless you want to play the Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.
