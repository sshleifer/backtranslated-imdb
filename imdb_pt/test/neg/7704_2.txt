This movie is an insane episode of VH1's "Where Are They Now", or "Behind The Music." In the first half of the movie (which portrays her "glory days"), Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as some sort of delirious rock star. You know the type; the vocalist poseur, the handsome boy, who did not write anything of the music, does not have the slightest idea, but receives all the glory for nothing and girls of grace. Consequently, he takes his success as a guarantor, abuses him, and ultimately destroys him along with himself. In fact, Hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was arrested for trafficking cocaine, lacking bail, and hiding. <br /> <br /> The second part of the movie deals with the hidden time. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic baby crying, blaming everyone, anyone but himself for his fall. Eventually times pass by completely; and he can never deal with it. That sad. THE END. The final credits roll and OH NO! We learned that Abbie Hoffman ended up committing suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this is not the image that the filmmakers intended for Hoffman to make this film. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I'm sure they wanted this film to be a tribute to the life of a man who was at last an icon of the 1960s and of the antiwar movement of the Left. In that they failed miserably. The film features Abbie Hoffman as a meaningless caricature. We are never told what motivates him. How did he come to their points of view? How did he capture the imagination of an entire generation? How did he organize such a vast movement? Why, at the height of his fame, was he involved in cocaine trafficking? Because? Who knows, and since the filmmakers do not seem, after all, who cares?
