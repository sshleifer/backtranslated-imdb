OK, I could only find three reasons to consider this movie interesting considering the extremely low budget. <br /> <br /> First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, the two gave me four good reasons to watch, and I watched. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to watch is that much was filmed on the same street. Now, I did not know beforehand, but I saw an Orange County car sticker and said, wow! this was filmed in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the flashback of the boy's past and ancestors, but that was it. The murders of the pumpkin man were very lame, with the exception of the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, that's fine, but the Return of the Living Dead will cause more excitement.
