The idea is great, spoiled by the jury. <br /> <br /> Why make fun of people? if what the inventors say is true, and as most of them say, they spent their lives saving on invention, the least is to reject the idea without making fun of people. <br /> <br /> Also, it shows when they want to accept an idea of ​​the nail they have added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only thing I respect from the judges is the one who always sits on the right side of the table, he's a respectable person <br /> <br /> of course the English snob that claims to be a man of business, wearing a suite, does not make you a friend <br /> <br /> last but not least, the big man who stands between the Englishman and the crier. Wake up man, the work is not called and inventor for you to call one. an inventor is an attribute and not a man who works. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon from the American Idol, they thought it worked there, it might work here as well. the context is different and the idea is totally different. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea and they could have made a good show with it if they just changed the judges and removed their act and attitude. <br /> <br /> Stop making fun of people.
