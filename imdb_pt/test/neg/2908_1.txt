This is horrible. No, actually, this is, no bar, the absolute worst ... the worst ... I hesitate to call it a @ & $% on '_movie_. It is a ninety minute visual radicular canal. The plot is virtually nonexistent: a mad scientist who looks like the lead singer of 'The Cars' impregnates a woman in her secret lab, a lawn chair in what I think might be a garage, through a Palmolive injection. In a few hours she gives birth to an adult monster who then becomes furious. That's the whole movie. The scenes of death: these are ill-defined, take_forever_ and acting ... how can you disturb _screaming_ ?? The victims stay there while the congested freak, snarling, wheezing rushes over them and begins strangling them for about three days. The sets are cheesy, the lighting for most of the film consists of a single maglite (yes, a large flashlight), the sound quality is poor, there are only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire movie and the acting is generously described as wood. The images are unabashedly recycled to fill the film. And the special effects would make any BBC science fiction production nod and proclaim "They did not even try." The 'Monster' is an unnamed name in a $ 3 rubber mask for Halloween with a few printed bandages. In his encounter with the solitary cop of the film, the cop shoots non-flash, invisible, smoke-free bullets that apparently travel so slowly that the monster can avoid them five paces away. I do not see this movie. No, this is not a challenge. I do not see this movie. The director must be shot. The writer must be chained to a giant stone, where his liver will be devoured every morning by Ed Wood. Rent arrives and there could be a sequel, do not let it happen!
