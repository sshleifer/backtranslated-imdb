First of all, since I am one of the people who has never seen the MST3K chopped version of this movie, I can not comment on that. <br /> <br /> However, I saw the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought it was as good as anything else on the channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their best deals. <br /> <br /> I noticed when reading the comments here that people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a minimum of intelligence, consideration and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and with good reason. In its original cut, the most reasonable people I think would probably rate at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five is medium to me and I think this movie is about average for a Sci Fi photo. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the above, I also noticed that reviewers who look immature, dull and twisted and, as a result, leave like the idiots where I am from, are the same ones that can not find anything from good about this movie and basically rubbish based mostly on seeing it choppy and fricasseed on MST3K. Or if they saw both cuts, it looks like they were greatly hampered by the MST3K's view to get started.
