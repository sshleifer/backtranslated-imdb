seriously, if I wanted to make a movie that makes zero sense, it never will, and features lesbian scenes as their only high point, I could have. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst, as is this movie. anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story was not so slow and prolix. the story means nothing without something at the end beyond the credits. what a waste of time. I will never regain the 147 minutes of my life and hope that others can learn from my mistake.
