Not to be confused with George Zucco's 1943 film "The Mad Ghoul", "The Mad Monster" is a film that Zucco appeared in the previous year. In this paint-by-numbers scene, Zucco perfects a way to turn his idiotic little man, Petro, into a hybrid wolf / man by injecting wolf blood, and then wastes little time sending the transformed idiot to kill ex-colleagues who had mocked their experiments. It's a very simple plot, really, and a production with extremely low budget. Glenn Strange, who plays the man / wolf here, would soon achieve greater fame by playing the monster Franky in films such as "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The make-up job on him is pretty lame and can only make him look like a hippie with bad teeth (like the 1957 Teenage Monster). The sets in this film, moreover, are nonexistent, and the outcome is abrupt and unconvincing. I gave the film a very generous 4 stars, partly because I have a permanent love for horror movies from the 1940s, but to tell the truth, most viewers would probably consider this a ridiculous crap, and I suppose so. Certainly not Universal's masterpiece or Val Lewton's masterpiece, for sure! Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in fussy little piffle like this. If you can spare 72 minutes of your life, I suppose you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (not much worse, of course!). Ah ... another thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and you know what that means: fuzzy images, bad sound (actually the worst sound of any Alpha video DVD I've found so far) and no extras. You have been warned!
