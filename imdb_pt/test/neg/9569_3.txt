Well, I saw this movie during the last Festival of San Sebastian. The reaction was ... let's just say as funny as the movie, unintentionally. It turned out that they showed a copy with terribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They seemed to be a translation from Chinese to English and then to Spanish. It was all confusing, the genres were changed (girls appeared as boys and boys as girls), and my friends and I remembered great lines ... but because they were so absurd. All in all is not a good movie, but if they never show it on tv, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie), then go ahead, "secret visible "is your movie.
