This movie is based on the Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero) series! It is put in another setting that Streetfighter the animated movie! This movie is about Ryu, who is joined by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! There were no other characters used in the video game (which I could find out)! The fight scenes were OK, but nothing really spectacular! And there were not many of them! For me this is strange! Streetfighter is not about fighting! Streetfighter the animated film (1994) is far superior to this movie. He tries to be more than he really is! The use of "Power Hada" and other supernatural elements has nothing to do with the abilities that the characters have in the video game! And in this case this is a bad thing! The story is so annoying that you do not care what is happening! The action is moderated considerably! Because? And what happened to the other characters in the video game! Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the videogame are the characters with their own special abilities! In this movie it's all about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
