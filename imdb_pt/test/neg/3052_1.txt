Worst movie I've ever seen! 90 minutes of excruciating filmmaking. All the ingredients to make this film a true work of CRAP. Bad acting, bad direction, bad narrative, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. She also released a nasty and terrible photo of a silly blonde, and a shot of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were scary, since these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out in the '80s, but this could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the biggest sins in storytelling: he introduced characters at the end of the film (an Old Man and an Old Woman). I would vote for less than 1 in 10, but the voting system does not work this way, apparently. Since the title sequence, I knew it would be a drug and would return my DVD, but Best Buy does not return DVDs or consumables as they call it, or so my receipt says. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and this was really awful, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" (an obvious Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was much worse than "Dunwich Horror". This is exactly like "Howl", how in hell could sequelae be extracted from this anorexic cow? Save your money and get the "Saw Massacre" (just do not take any of its sequels) or "The Dead of Evil" or "Dawn of the Dead". "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second was just a maddening and unbearable pain to the public, because the whole movie was horrible! Do yourself a favor, do not see it! You will be saving some brain cells.
