A really lousy movie, really low budget, with a terrible acting, a complicated and futile plot, a modest rework of the tales of vampires mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is a total mess, meaningless to most parts, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like several low-budget independent films of this type <br /> <br /> A waste of time
