This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind that makes the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing to do with what was happening. The film seems to be an extremely poor blast from Bladerunner, that is, dishonest android being chased by the bounty hunter (or ruthless cop on it). Luke Skywalker performs surprisingly well as the above-mentioned dishonest cop. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we have never discovered anything of substance about the android or what its intentions are. There is a bewildering scene in which Bill Paxton (who has abducted the android) plays a particular song on his cardboard airplane for no particular reason (the song is called The Yardbirds' "Shape of Things"). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this music have any relevance to the film? Do not think like that.
