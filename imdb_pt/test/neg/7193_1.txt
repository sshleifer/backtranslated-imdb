Well, do not bother. This movie looks so tired, the acting is so outdated, and the plot and characters so monotonous, it must be studied rather than watched. It's really a horrible film waste; Stereotypes, clich√©s, absurdities and amateur films. I watched in unbelievable admiration with my mouth open. How could such a film be made and, more interestingly, how could anyone find it funny or watchable? Old, tired, sloppy ... a junior sketch, at best. There is nothing there except for a study of a very old movie. Not a good movie, just old. This is not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. It makes no sense. The acting is so bad that it might be worth watching just for laughter. Some movies are so bad they are good. But, this goes all the way around the corner and back to evil again.
