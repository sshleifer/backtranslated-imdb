I saw this movie in 1956 and again at Cable a few days ago. The film did not improve with age. Quite the opposite. It's a real spaghetti epic. <br /> <br /> The Trojans are heroic and friendly; the Greeks are unpleasant, mean and sneaky. <br /> <br /> What if Paris ran away with the king's wife? Hey, love is love.
