Let us clarify one thing; That was bad! So putrid that it does not even qualify to be imprinted on someone's memories. <br /> <br /> The ever-repeated plot (which is the constant recycling of not just jokes, but story lines and character appearances.) A typical plot is as follows; Sue (the mother) opens the episode by citing how she loves her baby, but it smells horribly (as if that did not get old! Har-de-bloody-har!), Some Australian almost nationalist "bogan" she's an ozzie while everything / everyone is not a drug before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a little mercy) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot revolves around the father (Gary) getting into some kind of disagreement with Sue and him talking to the members of his band for advice on how to solve this. <br /> <br /> The phrase "words fail me" is old, but that's the sincerest thing to say. It's so incredibly bad! So HORRIBLE, I wish every trace of his existence were sent down into the lower depths of the North Sea and life could go on. <br /> <br /> It saddens me, to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good Ardal Hanlon (My Hero apart) has the ability to be quite funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, as distinguished from so many good things , somehow manages to get to that point ... then the comedy is in serious trouble!
