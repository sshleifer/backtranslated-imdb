Since I do not have TV, and had never heard of this mini-series, I did not know what to expect from The Second Coming and hired it purely based on the synopsis of the plot, which sounded interesting. <BR> Dear God! (Every intentional pun.) If someone told me this was written by a thirteen-year-old gang who got the bill to turn the second into a school play, I would not have been surprised. <br /> <Why, oh, why did they decide to portray Jesus Mark II as the equivalent of a wise idiot? Is there anything in any of the gospels that suggests this? Okay, an ordinary guy, but a big jerk from the north. I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> Apparently all that Jesus did to impress people was his miracles, because accordingly, his preaching certainly never impressed anyone. Certainly, without nightfall, the stuntman of Jesus Eccleston would be struggling without a canoe, an oar or any kind of follower. <br /> <br /> And the strange gay polemics were put down unwillingly, without rhyme. or reason. In addition to, of course, Russell nods to his QAF fan base. Jesus appears in the bar to recruit "disciples" (losers from the most impassive north and, of course, the author of the gay writer - the Harper woman, boring, annoyed, irritated). Gay rights are stuck in his throat with no real purpose, almost as if Russell thought he owed the boys to put Jesus in the place. <br /> <br /> I really can not see the true Jesus coming out with "Well, I have nothing against it personally, mate." Only someone truly middle-class and wool could imagine Jesus so wet. <br /> <br /> And do not start me in the end. 'Please come and eat rat poison because the only way to be truly free is if God dies.' It was like a sketch by Eddie Izzard about God as Bill Gates. "Hello, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've shown me that my global domain is overloading your style. I'm going to give it all to you, my clients." And eat rat poison, of course. <br /> <br /> I'm often confused with IMDb ratings, but the high rating on this leads to the cookie. <br /> <br /> Never mind Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus for brainless MTV kids. <br /> <br /> God help us really.
