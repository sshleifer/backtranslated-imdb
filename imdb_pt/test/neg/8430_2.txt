I remember watching this miniseries for the first time in 1984, with a growing sense of anger and indignation. After reading the reviews on this title, I must agree with the people of Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and to me it seemed nothing more than an exercise in American nationalism with a nationalist banner, in which American athletes are glorified at the expense of everyone else. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted by the way they were portrayed in this series. It may, however, help explain how many American spectators behaved at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and the television coverage that seemed interested only in events that the Americans were likely to win.
