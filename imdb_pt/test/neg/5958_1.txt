One of York Entertainment's most recent (disastrous) films, "El Chupacabra" stands out in making its viewer want to die after having wasted two hours watching. This movie seems to have been filmed with a replacement camcorder typically used for birthday parties. The only reason I could say it was not was because of certain scenes in which the cameraman's shadow is on the frame. Almost every aspect of cinema is haunted by this film, and I'm sure the film industry has backtracked for another ten years. The actors are retarded, usually pausing while they wait for the card to cue off the screen to change. The actor who plays Navarro not only insults and jumps the word in his dialogue, but is faced with the plot of Swiss cheese with a squint and confused look on his face. Other actors break the fourth wall and show the acting ability of a twelve-year-old boy doing a science project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I purposefully searched for the worst movies possible, and this one gave us more than we expected. The funny parts are bland and the rest are full of horrible cliches and plot holes. As a friend so humbly put it, this movie is the aborted fetus of the industry. I would highly suggest this movie to people like me who purposefully searched for these movies, but for everyone else, watch out!
