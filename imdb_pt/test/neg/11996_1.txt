When a group of dumb kids (including a racist bitch who does not like it) stays in an old house, it awakens four Toltec murderous spirits. Lash La La can save the day? Will you be able to watch until the end because of the horrible comedy on display? <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is the kind of really bad horror / comedy hybrid that Troma used to launch regularly. The thing is, they did not. release it. This does not justify the whole thing, since it has a synthesizer soundtrack (including bad attempts at Native American music and worse "comedy" music), bad makeup effects (basically Halloween masks) and atrocity (Ok, the fat was fine , although all the others are terrible, and La Rue, a veterinarian of Western cinema, seems ashamed to be there - not that I actually blame him.) The worst thing is comedy. aspects. Of course, stupid teenagers is one thing, but when the film continues to talk about Toltec spirits as if they were the supreme evil, only for them to become fools horribly annoying and awkward, all hope is thwarted. Combining horror and comedy requires at least some skill. There's no skill on display here, since everything is just stupid, and not "so dumb is fun" as well. I mean "smoking marijuana and listening to bad Punk Rock, am I not stupid?", Idiot. <br /> <br /> Not even a decent guy uprooted and a girl with little clothes can save that disaster. Terrible movie, and neither is it worth renting.
