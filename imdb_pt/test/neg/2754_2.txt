Make no mistake, Bigshot High School is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot is about a nerd who makes a plan to get rich and have the girl. However, he does everything wrong, and of course by the end of the movie he ends up dead along with some other people, fortunately including the girl. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is every woman caring about is wealth. Also for us men, I think we should accept or "have" or "we do not"! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie could be rated as 1, but it is above the worst of the movies. The acting is not totally horrible and the production values ​​are not ultra-terrible. Above all it's a bad movie and not worth seeing for many reasons. If you insist, of course, on torturing yourself, watch the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 1.5 / 10)
