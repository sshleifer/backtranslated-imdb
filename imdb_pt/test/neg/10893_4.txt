A young couple decides to flee to sunny California. They never reach their destination when they decide to stop at the Rest Stop. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on stopping. When she is ready to leave, she leaves the bathroom to find her boyfriend vanished with her car, leaving her stuck on Texas roads with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company. <br /> <br /> Rest Stop is one of those cheap and cheesy horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop becomes a cult classic you may ask? Well, the three elements you need to become a cult classic are sexual, sexual and artistic merit. The rest stop has a lot of blood bullets and although I do not want to give in too much, it contains a lot of blood-soaked wickedness. This movie has everything from the bad guy running on the legs of a police officer with his car several times to him, making use of a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. Sometimes it can be as bloody as a movie can get. He also has a free love scene and yet quite intimate in the opening minutes of the movie. Therefore, the sex is covered. Now the disk? Do you have any artistic merit? Can not you ever see the bandit's face? You see glimpses, profiles, shadowy silhouettes. He is a faceless monster, relentless, who only earns much on the scale of artistic merit. Does the film have very few characters in it besides the main protagonist? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). As she spends much of the film alone, she can not reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation, but she must speak out loud so we, the audience, know what she's thinking. Sometimes this can be a bit annoying; however, is a bold step by the writer (John Shiban) and works for most of the film. As an audience knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilization is scary enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> So, will Rest Stop become a cult classic? Probably because over the course of gore, sex and debatable artistic merit, it also has many chills, an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to many screams on the screen, since the main character does many things that you definitely should not do. when running from a psychotic killer. (What fun are horror movies if you can not complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
