If you're in this movie to learn something about depression, forget it: you will not learn anything other than not writing a screenplay about it. I understand that the intent was to show how severe depression can turn ordinary people into a complete disaster, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie ... nothing of minor importance. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the whole of this movie screaming at the top of her lungs, insulting someone violently, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being a hushed silence at the beginning and the end). There is no clue as to how she could be without depression ... nor a glimpse of other aspects of her personality ... she just screams. At one point, her roommate tells her, "Lizzie, you're such a fun person when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "Is she?" It seemed strange that the writers included this comment without giving us any examples, but this script is a lesson of incompetence. It has no discernible structure or flux; instead, it consists of a series of scenes of Lizzie screaming awkwardly and ends. Character development? No ... Scenes from your everyday existence, that is, going to class, which can be important details? No ... Screaming at maximum volume? CHECKS. Not enough, I'm afraid. 1/10
