Despite having a very beautiful protagonist (Rosita Arenas, one of my boyish passions), acting and directing are examples of what NOT to do when making a movie. <br /> <br /> Placed in southern Mexico, Popoca, the Aztec mummy (true Aztecs, by the way, did not make mummies) was awakened by the main characters and begins to cause problems in the suburbs of Mexico City during the first movie (The Mummy Aztec). In this second part, the main man and the woman want to find the mummy and place it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> In this appears the Bat, a criminal stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (some idiot inside a SUIT robot) to control Popoca and (to understand) dominate the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever seen. The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio! <br /> <br /> The acting is so horrible to hear the movie in Spanish as in English (they called it overacting!). You should watch this movie by MST: 3000. Comments are even funnier.
