Fatal Contact: Bird Flu in America: 3 out of 10: This movie is funny and sad. The funny part is pretty obvious, as this is certainly not a sobering look at a possible imminent crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. Much like killer bees (and the so-called killer bees crisis that motivated them), Bird Flu has joined a pantheon of media-inspired end-of-world scenarios (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming) that simply refuse to happen. /> <br /> The sad part is the blatant attempt by filmmakers to inspire panic. Historically, disease pandemics were quite common, after all, not all people died in their forties due to heart disease. Even recent pandemics like AIDS mirror the old VD (think syphilis) crisis that used to kill more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The flu pandemic of the first twenty years was a nasty business killing millions, but honestly life was on. I wonder if our most dramatic media and powerful government allies would allow life to be normal today. <br /> <br /> The film itself wildly from quite competent scenes (Triage on the grand Central Station) to ridicule (Rednecks try to ambush the National Guard in Manhattan). <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are completely useless as filmmakers can not decide exactly how contagious avian flu is or if the symptoms are an Ebola-style accident. or simply a long illness. In fact, one scene will show everyone in biologically risky attire and the next will have no one wearing a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also refuses to give practical advice on what to do in a bird flu crisis. . (Out of hand washing, what no duct tape?) The acting and direction are competent for a TV movie, but the script is all over the map. Lastly, the movie has a strangely non-exponential total of deaths at the bottom of the screen. Just like Swarm did.
