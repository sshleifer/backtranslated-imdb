This is not "so bad that it's good" - It's "so bad that it violates the Geneva Convention's ban on cruel and unusual punishment!" Only by reading the Synopsis you can discover the "plot" of this direct disaster for video. It's a miscellany of grainy images combined with some of the worst performances of all time that you've ever had the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess with "Dead Men Do not Dress Manta", it's like saying "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane." The talentless cast is dressed in cheap clothes, from J.C. Penney's "Goin to Church," and there is not the slightest attempt at hairstyles and makeup. If you really want to see how this kind of "homage" can work, check out "Cadavra's Lost Skeleton" - It's clever, well written and best of all run by real actors who are not so agonizing to see. By the way, look for the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose science fiction short film "The Attack of the Courtesy Lady of 70 Feet" leaves this film in the dust. People in Terror In the Tropics look and sound as if they had been taken off the street and given their scripts to read during the first and only take. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney and anyone else involved in the films they cannibalized to make this festival! Money is not the problem - much can be accomplished with very little expense. A good script, decent actors, and, above all, Z-Grade costumes and production design should have been given before the so-called director created that stinking stack of cinematic offals. Let's hope the "promise" of a sequel does not come true - this was by far the scariest thing shown throughout the movie !!
