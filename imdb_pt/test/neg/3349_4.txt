I saw this on a cheap DVD release titled "The Entity Force". Since I like the flamboyant horror movies of the '80s, I thought it was a real treat. Unfortunately, the movie is boring and you're always waiting for something to happen. Eventually, it gets a bit interesting, but that's in the last quarter of the movie. It's a little too late case. When the action happens is not so great, what we have are corpses "floating" on the ground and chasing the girls in the mausoleum. It's not the worst I've seen, but you can do so much better. I would only recommend this to horrifying horror collectors of the '80s.
