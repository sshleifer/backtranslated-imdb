The planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster, so that humanity now survives clandestinity divided into different religious cults. What caused the catastrophe? I have no idea ? Why is humanity divided into different ecclesiastical factions? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer sustain human life, how can humans cultivate the earth to feed the population? I have no idea . What kind of producer did you think this script deserved to receive funding? I have no idea <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of those movies that creeps late into the night on cable channels. The type of movie in which you consult the IMBb to see if it has any merit. The number of people who commented on SHEPHERD on this page has not yet reached double digits and this is a movie that was released nine years ago. Maybe the people who have never seen are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot, it is very routine. Former grumpy police officer Boris Dakota, whose wife and son have been dead for several years, knows a woman and her son and it is up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Play a former wrestler who now runs God channel, a fascist Christian guy who's trying to get rid of Boris, a ventriloquist, some T & A because of that and you have a movie mess. I think after seeing this DOOMSDAY from Neil Marshall it's possibly a cinematic masterpiece in comparison
