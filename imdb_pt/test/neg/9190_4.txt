This film basically tries to portray the heroism of firefighters, making the whole movie revolve around an American father with a good heart who puts others before himself. Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father who is a firefighter but as there is nothing interesting about him about it, so when the movie reaches its climax there is little or no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting, but it's just as annoying as any other job except you save lives or properties extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire department, but anyone could have played his part and he is a boring character like the rest of the movie. What could have been a good movie is that firefighters are placed as heroes because they are firefighters and turn the whole scene into an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
