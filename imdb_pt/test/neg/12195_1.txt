This was not a good movie !! Why do you keep saying that? There's a good story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Because? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Besides, what the hell ?! There are all these "superhuman" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate them all. Quickly too. It's not like there's a long fight scene with a lot of fighting. There were only three guys from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by Cheech and leave the homeless with no family in the middle of Mexico. History end. Literally. Oh, and the strip club was an Aztec temple which is funny because it would have to be south of Mexico, not the border. Why are you lying and telling people that this is a good movie? Do not rent, buy or watch this movie at a friend's house. You'll wish you had that time of your life back.
