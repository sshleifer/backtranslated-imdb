This is why this film fell far short of its potential (I do not read much, so I do not care about the novel). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man from Lambert's Tarzan. It was hard, and while his call to Tarzan was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They screwed up the story. Maybe that's how the book goes, but ever since I remember Tarzan's first statements were "Me tarzan, you Jane." Jane is the first human encounter with tarzan. I liked the natives a bit more than the dwarven pygmies of Weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit extravagant. 3. Tarzan is mostly a love story. I'm sorry, but love interest comes more than an hour into the photo. This qualifies her for a supportive role at best. Supporting roles and leads do not fit each other, there is not enough time on the screen, sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell's widow pathetic (probably because her strong southern accent could not be masked) the chemistry scale between Tarzan and Jane was incredible. I never believed that they loved each other, which made the Belgian guys really close their mouths, frankly, silly. When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels a will, if he wants, a feeling he has never felt before. Jane brings humanity into him, and he brings her untamed side. It is this chemistry that compels the story of Tarzan. Not that Lord Greystoke's wish is to keep his whole land and that the Johnny boy do it for him. Even a good face lift could not help in this movie. It needs massive internal rebuilding. Oh, and we could possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that do not show the sound scene as qualities of the place. Final Judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry, Tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see a real performance, topple Lambert and check out Leonardo Dicaprio.
