Sidney Poitier, an Oscar-winning actor in "Lilies of the Field," plays his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs in 1967, who won the Oscar for Best Picture "In the Heat of the Night", for the tired and uninspired sequence of the veteran director Gordon Douglas "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs", with no one the equivalent of Rod Steiger with whom the exchange of dialogue. of their game when they wrote this predictable police procedural potboiler.The dialogue is monotonous and none of the characters is interesting, not even the main suspect.Ã‚ Absolutely nothing remotely exciting, suspenseful or surprising occurs in this meek whodunit.Meanwhile, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "In the Heat of the Night." He worked as a homicide detective for the Philadelphia Police Department in Pennsylvania. am of MISTER Tibbs, "our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. In addition, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair of Change of Habit), and a family, a rebellious young son, Andy (George Spell of "The Naked Kiss"), and a younger daughter, Ginger Spell of "Hickey and Boggs"). Tibbs drives an average blue Mustang and his wife holds the house and hangs over his two children, since he does not have much time to spend on them. Literally, there are no surprises in this murder mystery of pedestrians. In fact, the best thing about "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is the Quincy Jones soundtrack with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this forgotten criminal thriller deserved. <br /> <br /> It all starts sensationally with a prostitute fight, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of "The Adventurers"), being beaten to death in the bedroom of her apartment in the center of the city by an invisible robber. Homemade Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez of "Intruder on the Dust") enters Joy's apartment and finds it lying on the dead carpet with a bloody forehead. He grabs the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports Joy's death to Rice's superintendent, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of "License to Kill"), and Weedon hands Mealie and a handful of dollars and sends him packing. . Later, Weedon anonymously notifies the SFPD that popular minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of "Nevada Smith") beat Joy to death and appears to be leaving Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") attributes to Tibbs to deal with the case; It seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbs' wife, Valerie, does not believe that the known and politically active evangelist has committed such a crime. Just to give the context of the film, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word "semen", arguably a controversial term to mention in a movie from the early 1970s. Tibbs questions Weedon, whom he suspects, to be a drug dealer or a pimp. Weedon explains that she has no records on Joy Sturges because she was subletting the apartment of another real estate company. Tibbs visits the real estate agent and realtor Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") flees and leaves, essentially doing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes the car after a long but meek chase. When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he allows her to leave, with his disgruntled wife, Marge (Norma Crane of "Penelope"), prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a prostitute to stay in an apartment. <br /> <br /> Tibbs traces Mealie's handyman and the crime cleaner, and then he goes after Weedon. Fortunately, for Tibbs, our hero picks up the evil Weedon in the middle of a narcotic deal. One of Weedon's henchmen assaults Tibbs, but Tibbs dispenses shortly before embarking on a long standing chase after Weedon. Eventually, he cornered Weedon in an underground parking lot and they shoot. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the Tibbs house are more interesting than his research. Andy runs loose, attacking his sister and smoking in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs appears three times in the jaw. These child-rearing scenes could probably never be dealt with today as they were in 1970. At the end of the film, as if to solidify the family sequence, Tibbs is seen hanging out with his wife and children. There is in the confrontation between Valerie and Virgilio about the welfare of their children and how their long hours of work affected them. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Douglas leads competently. Surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, filmmakers never play the racing letter. In one scene, when Tibbs searches for a billiard room owned by an African-American, we see a mixed race of frowning races at the hero when he meets Mealie and leaves with him in tow. <br /> <br /> In all, "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is a poor continuation of "In the Heat of the Night". Remember, Poitier delivers other good performance with nuances, but everything looks pre-made. All the scenarios look fake and there is not much physical violence: a underground shooting that does not last long and a fight. In addition to Jones' seminal jazz score, the only surprise - and really does not qualify as a big surprise, more as a convenient gimmick - is the ending. "The Organization," by Donald Medford, followed "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" as the second most action-packed sequel.
