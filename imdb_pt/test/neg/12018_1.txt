I saw this movie in the movies and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver, who now becomes even worse in sequence, is the biggest intolerance I can not figure out. Junior upset his father because he would not go to school that has his crazy crazy dad Ben. Also the operator of Crazy Dance is not fair with Junior for not letting him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer for Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior, and that's why I can not tolerate this movie. Even if the movie is re-released in theaters in the extended version, I still would not see this movie, because this movie is not something I can tolerate. In fact, that stinks!
