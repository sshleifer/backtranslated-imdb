I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 at a local flea market. I thought with the cast in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles are all OK), it would be really good. Boy, was I wrong. This movie really pissed me off. Almost every scene drags on for a long time. The scene where Rob Lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a hard bar forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is not picknick either. My guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The current rating of 1.9 here in imdb is right about money. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Go watch some paintings dry for 1.5 hours instead of watching this! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'Mean Guns' (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
