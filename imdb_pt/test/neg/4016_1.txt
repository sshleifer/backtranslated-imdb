An "independent" movie that, from the back of the box, promises twists, adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget. This movie also tricks us to watch, exhibiting Rachel Lee Cook with a starring role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie will not give you ANYTHING. The story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. All three "disturbed" characters have only little grains of history to force us to care. As you come to an end, everything about the story is changed and instead of helping the audience to follow, you are left with no idea and, most importantly, no interest in "why." The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, appears to enter the film without any prior experience or knowledge of useful films. The whole piece looks like a college "art" movie, created by a film student who tries to hide the lack of talent.
