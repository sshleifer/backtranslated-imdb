Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and lame and, unless indirectly intended, this film really glorify the Nazis and portray them as men of honor and show that the Jewish people are cheating, can not meet promises and damn cruel. Hitler along with the most notorious Nazis are participating in a less-than-stupid movie plot about the death of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris is incredibly ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and shouting every kill in the movie as if they were watching a stupid basketball game, the deal in the end is lame. What is really shocking is that the movie has garnered great reviews and is rated here in the 40's in the top 250 films. You will not be surprised if you reap many awards, including Oscar, too. the film is simply a kiss for the Jewish people, but he reconsiders, is not even doing a great job doing it. It really overshadows the whole conflict between Nazis and Jews and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.
