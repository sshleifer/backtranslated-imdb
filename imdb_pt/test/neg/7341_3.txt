This film was filmed in Randolph County, central North Carolina, in 1968, when a film crew in the state was a rare thing. The sites were the counties of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding countryside. It's not a particularly good movie. He had Merle Haggard and brought his life inland for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard shootemup. Cinematography is that fuzzy thing that came out in the late sixties and early seventies. Local people were excited to be part of the venture. <br /> <br /> If viewers find it difficult to find a copy of this film, a paper copy will be available in Asheboro, North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Uncredited actors include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull and Bill Nunnery.
