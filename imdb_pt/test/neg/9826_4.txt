I was looking forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good movie about Jefferson. This movie was not that. It was quite long, drawn out, monotonous and unbalanced. He spent a lot of time exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and was not spending enough time in his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely horrible. His acting was so bad it was like watching an A1 headhead trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant tearful voice irritated her nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson look like an ignorant man instead of a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and his feelings about slavery was also underdeveloped, but the rebellion of his eldest daughter (Patsy) is a key event at the end of the film. The film was too long and the script lacked energy and enthusiasm. On the plus side, the costumes were very beautiful, and Greta Scacchi represented the role of Cosway well. If you want to watch a movie about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then watch 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
