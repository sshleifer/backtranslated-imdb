The grandmother is definitely one of the worst horror films ever made in film history. <br /> <br /> The script was diabolical, so bad that I almost cried out laughing at some of the things with which they came out. . The acting was almost as bad, they would have been better off playing traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). Murders were laughable, suspense was non-existent, camera work was ineffective and the "main" turnaround at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, only getting worse and worse. "Grandma" is possibly one of the less threatening "villains" captured in the film, she seems to be wearing a cheap supermarket mask (her nylon hair caused an infinite amount of laughter) and a sweater with ruffles Would you be afraid of that ??? I certainly was not. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay movies ÔÅä), then this is a must see. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like to laugh at a shockingly bad dialogue, avoid like the plague.
