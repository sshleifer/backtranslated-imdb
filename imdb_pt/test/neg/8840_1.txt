With great expectations, I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar race this year. Part of being completely useless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, rendered and directed, the film is too long. He fails to deliver the "message" he tries to give, flaw in his narrative, clumsy historical settings, and most of all in his rhythm. There are some misconceptions so extreme that I have not seen in a movie for a long time (the story of Luke, whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense). The Spanish-speaking crowd around me was yawning and quickly losing patience, and some of the comments I overheard were whether members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before choosing the Oscar-winning film.
