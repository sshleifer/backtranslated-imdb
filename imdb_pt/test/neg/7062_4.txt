Some of the early talkies survived to become classics. "The Squall," 1929, is a classic, but not the way it was intended. Melodramatic in history and acting, today it seems ridiculous, particularly the cast of Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles sharing a young couple and driving a young man to steal. Outrageous, outrageous! However, as many people know, when Loy came to Hollywood, she did some of these exotic roles as seducer. Based on one play, "The Squall" refers to the gypsy who in the film is now in Hungary (Spain in the play) fleeing his cruel master and inviting himself to the home of the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), basically appearing at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm talking to her English ("Nubi is not bad! Nubi does not do anything wrong!") And hinting at good gifts. The son of the family, Paul (Carroll Nye) is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can hardly wait to marry her. He loses interest when he meets Nubi. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman who lives in the house and the gorgeous Loretta Young, the performance is uniformly awful. Loy is stuck with the marks of his character - bad English, lamentation and hysteria. With her dark, peasant makeup and curly hair, she's not only pretty, but quite different from the 1980s-quite modern, though Richard Tucker has put his hand on his forehead and reminds us that we've just come out of the silence. Robert Osborne at TCM commented that this movie is one of his secret pleasures. Although it is deliciously bad, it is not deliciously bad enough to sit again. It's just plain bad - but a great example of how far we have come, and if anyone had not noticed Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career could have been.
