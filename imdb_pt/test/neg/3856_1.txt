A friend of mine who has a mysterious ability to find and - horrors! - like bad movies recommended I watch 'The Pest.' At that time, not knowing how pathetic his taste was in movies, I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. The story, though clearly torn from any sixth-grade English book on the "hunter of men," would be fun under the right conditions-good actors, writer, director, wardrobe, and so on, almost endless. Clearly these factors are absent. <br /> <br /> 'The Plague' must be funny, I think. I say "think" because I let crack nothing more than a faint smile throughout the movie. Not a laugh, not a laugh, not a laugh, not even a smile. A smile, at best. And it happened so rarely while watching this movie that I even remember how often I smiled - maybe 3 or 4 times at best. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a huge favor. Never watch this movie. Avoid at all costs.
