It is rare to see films that appear in all aspects, but "Caligula" certainly should have that title. I'm not sure what's most horrendous; violence, sexual perversity, acting or plot (or gross lack thereof). The two and a half hours basically follows the infamous Roman Caesar's "Caligula" ascension to the throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perversities he allegedly committed while in power. The acting is lifeless and monotonous - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously, knowing that this movie was gravely lacking in anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to play as many nudity and orgy scenes as conceivably possible. But do not be fooled, these scenes do not make it easier or detract from the focus of the film's hideousness. The camera work is of poor quality, the dialogue is laughable, in fact, you would have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a serious face through such farsque lines. And then there's the violence .... <br /> <br /> If you're about to see the movie be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through writing), but through disgusting violent acts that are of little sense or purpose besides repelling the viewer. This is only goal this movie achieved. One must wonder how the creators of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it ends late, after two and a half hours, you do not take anything out of this movie beyond some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> You've been warned
