WARNING ** SPOILERS ** Lord knows I've seen some bad movies in my time and this makes me angry. This is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. The "story" involves a flight attendant who discovers that her boyfriend (misunderstood by another great Robert Wagner) is a murderer, thief and just a face of vomit in general. After the Concorde takes off, it sends guided missiles to destroy the Concorde. So while the Concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with total stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit and then sticks his hand in the window to shoot the missile! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it looks like his hand would have at least one blast. Then towards the end of the "climax", when the Concorde is heading for some disaster and all will die, a passenger turns to the groom and proposes marriage. A priest happens to be sitting in the next row and starts marrying them when the planes are falling! (I'm not making this up) Wow, the guy who wrote the script must be sniffing glue for a week.
