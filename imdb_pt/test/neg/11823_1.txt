This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The writing and acting are just pathetic. He is on the same level as Uncle Sam in the movies of all time. However, when I see such crap as this able to get to the video, it really inspires me to pursue my dreams of making movies because I know I could do a better job than the creators of Killers.
