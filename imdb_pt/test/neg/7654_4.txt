(May contain spoilers) This movie is the epitome of strangeness. I rented waiting for such a bad movie that would be funny. However, I honestly still can not decide if this movie was meant to be scary or humorous. It combines emotions in a very disturbing way. Apparently, this is trying to be smart, but it really is not. For example, when the knife leaves and tries to kill the teacher, it begins to play happy music. When we go to Toxico, we've almost hit, Mr. Neighborhood music by Roger. However, when the little child dreams of falling into "blood," and when she finds the leg, it is clearly intended that she is tense. So, watch this movie and decide for yourself. It is very strange to be described in words and for this I say, congratulations. <br /> <br /> "Nose-diving ... WOW!"
