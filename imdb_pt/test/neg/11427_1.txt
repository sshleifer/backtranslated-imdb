This is actually one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It's not funny at all. It simply depicts a British configuration from the lower class north. I find a movie very sad in some parts, in others, the cuts are where they should not be. One thing that really bothered me were the close-ups of nonsensical objects that really slowed down the movie. I just did it through the movie because I quickly sent certain sequences to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie completely loses public attention. The main problem is that he makes several reasons for an action, which, in turn, tends to weaken this action. However, if there is a reason for an action, it will become more in love. All in all this movie is all over the place. I did not learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the plot lines and changing stories, as I would have liked to explore the life of a character. <br /> <br /> For example, in the beginning, when the guy meets God in the bar, God seems like a nice guy. The film could have been drawn at that time and I think it would have been a lot funnier. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's enough. Watch if you want, but I'm warning you that this movie sucks. I respect the manufacturers for trying to do it with such a low budget but could have done a much better job. I think everything is in the camera movement and editing, the acting was decent. But again, this is just my opinion.
