I do not know how this film received so many positive comments. One can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed," but these things do not make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendo. I wish I had not wasted my time watching this movie. Instead of being biographical, it was a bad excuse to promote strange and lascivious behavior. It was just another attempt by Hollywood to convince us that this kind of life is normal and OK. From the beginning, I asked myself what the purpose of this film was, and I kept watching, hoping that this would change and I was quite disappointed to continue on the same line. I'm so glad I did not spend the money to see this in a theater!
