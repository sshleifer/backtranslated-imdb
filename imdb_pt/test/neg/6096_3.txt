I can only assume that the previous posts came from production company executives ... <br /> <br /> participated in the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook participated (they probably knew I would be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but that turkey is a movie. I felt sorry for them sometimes, when the audience laughed at what were serious 'thriller' scenes. <br /> <br /> But maybe I was missing the point. Perhaps an element of irony was intended. If so, pure genius. If not, career genocide. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Zane always shines, and Brook can really act a little. As the other half said (as we run out the movie theater, with broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this movie as they both look like nice people! The screenwriter, however, must be abandoned.
