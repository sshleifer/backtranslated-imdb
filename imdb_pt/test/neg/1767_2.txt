First, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion, both movies created and defined the Genre of Si-Fi Horror as we know it today. I realized that Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after seeing this movie I would disagree a lot. There are some cool special effects with the alien vampires, and the story may have been acceptable. I just can not seem to get past a naked space vampire all through the movie, this is absolutely absurd (though it looks good). Add a lot of bad British acting and it's pretty much it. Most of the movie ends up happening in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you miss the outer space setting and any hope of some real action and suspense from Si-Fi Horror. <br /> <br />
