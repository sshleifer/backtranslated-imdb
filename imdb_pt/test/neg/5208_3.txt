The banned film by Nico Mastorakis was quite disappointing in my opinion. The movie is about a couple, who goes to a Greek island to kill all perverted people (apparently). You know there's something very sick when one of the first scenes includes a guy having sex with a goat and then killing her. <br /> <br /> But things only get worse from that point, since all the scenes are very similar. . They meet some people, so they kill or have sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The ending is good when the couple becomes brother and sister and she is just letting him rot in some place. but overall, one would expect more. No substance here I'm afraid. 3/10.
