I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER making another "Biblical" movie again if Noah's Ark is the norm. In addition to the horrible, completely uninspired action of the entire cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly regret the day they agreed to make this movie), the timeline has been completely rearranged. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the hawker who was passing in his rowboat. Hello? EVERY WORLD was dead except Noah and his family according to the scriptures. God piled wood and added plans to build the ark when Noah questioned how? I also do not remember reading anything about Noah's wife constantly bothering him during the 40 days, or Noah wandering around with glazed eyes and stunned all the time. The screenwriter, of course, had very little knowledge of the book of Genesis, or simply did not care that his abomination of a story ridiculed him completely.
