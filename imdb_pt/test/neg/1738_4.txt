This movie started as a pretty decent movie, but was never released, instead it became predictable and even a little silly. Some scenes were very well done, photography and cuts used in combination with sounds and others made it a little more interesting to watch, but as the story was very slow, could not keep alive the interest. And more importantly, it's nothing scary! It's supposed to be a horror movie, but there was not a single scene that was close to being scary or even exciting. <br /> <br /> To be blunt, the actors were not that good, no colorful characters you go remember for the rest of your days. <br /> <br /> In general, an assistive movie, but does not add anything and once you finish watching it, it will not last long until it is already forgotten . The reason I watched it was because I had read some reviews giving high marks, but I disagree and instead I would rate it 4 out of 10. If you still want some Japanese horror, I suggest you watch Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
