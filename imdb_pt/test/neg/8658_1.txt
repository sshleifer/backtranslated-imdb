Definitely not worth the money or time. It's the same banal plot of a guy and a girl that meet and fall in love. But this is with a western touch. But it fails miserably in representing a love story or giving it the Western touch. We never felt that the hero and the heroine are in love. There's no depth to any of your characters. Probably, with a better cast, some justice might have been brought to the characters. Finally, it is a movie without fun, without acting, without theme, without plot, without comedy, without action, without emotion, without romance (I associate romance with something more in love). It's definitely not a movie you'd like to go with your family. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I'll wait for the day when Bollywood movies are something I can expect to watch and I can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie.
