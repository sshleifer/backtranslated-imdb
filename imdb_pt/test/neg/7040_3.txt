Two convicts escaped from the woods and shot two campers in the head. This is the first scene, and it made me shudder, fearing what was reserved. But by the end of the first half hour I was all wrapped up in the flurry of images. Not because I cared at all about the characters, but because I was horrified at how execrable the movie was and was curious to see how really low it could sink. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are the ex-inmates. After murdering the two innocent campers, they cross the bush and enter the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith and the distant homosexual Behr. The fugitives first pretend that their car broke down and they need to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identities. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like family territory so far. "Desperate Hours" or "Funny Games" maybe. But - wait - the gay son is in stunt with the two. It seems that Stockwell, upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named Billy, kicked Billy and expelled him. Billy is dead and Behr now blames his father for his death. And, in fact, Papa is a kind of Neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias, the fact that he has just been found cohabiting with a secretary. <br /> <br /> Behr has just searched and searched for someone else who had met Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. He ended up being one of the fugitives, and now Behr is determined to see them at his freedom. <br /> <br /> Everything gets distorted after that. People talk. They talk and talk. They talk continuously. And NOT about the two crazy killers who can barely wait to put one in their eyes. No - the dialog box says something like: "You were so afraid of something within yourself that you even drove your own child away." This is Behr, the young gay, talking to Stockwell. It's as if a domestic drama of the afternoon had its genes blended with a killer thriller into some kind of transformation device or shaker. <br /> <br /> The only real performance is given by James Remar as the most talkative and sinister of the two fugitives. And this is mostly because of his harsh, yet fluid baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson's, and his big lips like those of a guppy. It is easy for the eyes and ears. Dean Stockwell gave decent performances, including his invaluable bizarre turn in "Blue Velvet," in which he was my support player, but here laziness, advancing years, or The loose direction has shaped all his movements and all statements in a stereotype. It's as if he's reading instructions from the stage - "look surprised" and "scream in anger" - and follow them literally. There is no surprise in a car load. <br /> <br /> If the gay son, Jason Behr, blinked, it must have been while I was blinking at the same time, because I missed it. He has a long neck and just an expression on his instrument. Woolvett, as the secondary villain, fades into the woodwork with pine panels. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he has not given up his day job. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the staging works without being innovative. Sometimes it's confusing. I lost track of where everyone should be while the killers circulated on the porch of the cabin and the family locked themselves inside with a shotgun. I also could not understand how Stockwell could walk through the door of the hut, hit Remar and knock him down on the porch, and then Remar could just stand up, dust off, and come up with an angry retort. like, "Okay, two can play this game." But why continue? See if you should.
