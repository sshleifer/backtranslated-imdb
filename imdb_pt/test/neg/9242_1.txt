I watched this movie and all I can say is this ... I'm not a film student, nor am I an artistic intellect trying to look for a deeper meaning in everything I do not understand. However, if I did this with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yes! He's stoned and I can imagine that now ... he was traveling one night and was sitting with his friends laughing and saying things like, hey ... would not it be funny if the nuns really could fly? As if someone just fell off an airplane and freedom fell for a while, it got on the ground and got up and left? * cackle * or if buckwheat gave the Pope a bath? oh my god, I'm cracking just thinking about it! Face! We have to make a movie about it! And then he tells his friend how he's laughing ... Oh, and would not it be hilarious if people worshiped and called me a genius for it? So to me, this is what happens when a guy uses too many drugs, writes a screenplay and makes a movie. Should I be doing LSD to understand what this guy was thinking so I could laugh too? Because I have to tell you, I was not laughing. I was yawning and checking the time. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone who is trying so hard to find deeper meaning is hysterical. I had never heard of this director until I got to read the reviews, which I did because I was angry for having lost the last 2 hours, or as it always was, (it seemed like 12 hours of my life) and I can never have back, anyway ... I read that this guy is addicted to heroin and he wanted to die of art? what the heck is that? So my point is kind of proven. This guy is not all there, he's a drug addict, and his movie is proof of that ... So please stop trying to find deeper meaning for him. If anyone really wants to understand everything in this movie, go drop some LSD, sit down and relax, then it can really make sense. <br /> <br /> I remembered the time when I saw the Last Days of Gus Van Sant, another movie that I was angry to watch. I can not help but wonder what the ratings for that movie would be if the same people reviewed it and reviewed it. It seems that if the director of the film is totally out of his mind, or if it is a French film with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, it will get great reviews, hands down, anything else is boring and it has already been done . Blah, bring the boring, please!
