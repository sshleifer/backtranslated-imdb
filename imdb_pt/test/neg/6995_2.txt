The movie listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the movie that is available on Something Weird Video in his "Driver's Ed Scare Films Vol. 5". For one thing, the 1980 version is in color. The SWV has on this record an earlier (1972) version of the black and white film for the WLWT TV Channel 5 in Cincinnati. Either way this movie is notorious. However, unlike most other riders' films, this was planned for television broadcasting and viewing by the general public. Thus the level of carnage has been reduced. It is still a rather bleak exercise in the exploration of bloody death by a purported educational intent. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember that this thing is shown every year around the prom period on Channel 5. If you are looking for a movie that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely American phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is very typical. slow, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy in melodrama. If it really affected the driving of any teenager, nobody knows.
