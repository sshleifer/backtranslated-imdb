This is just terrible. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this story. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I do not remember laughing much except for some blatant inconsistencies and glaring mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive middle-aged man named Lester finds himself rich and unattractive. middle-aged women through ads for lonely hearts, and then kills them for the money they need to feed their gambling addiction. That's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way, there is an intrigue attempt when Lester begins to receive calls from a mysterious stranger who insults him about his secret but so poorly implemented that you may not realize what really should be going on. The sequences in which Lester kills rich widows are all quite brutal, but also seemingly dressed as comedies. A sequence has a woman beaten with a wooden pole and then pushed into an oven. It is very cruelly portrayed, but it is played against big band waltz music, with Lester grimacing and adopting comedy poses everywhere. Another scene has the murdered victim while she sings strident opera songs ... you have to see this to believe! In fact - you do not have to see anything, in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there is no evidence of any of the talent seen in his previous career. One sequence stood out to me as particularly unfortunate: the revelation when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think of any visual representation of this phenomenon on screen, so from then on, he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all! And so it totally blows the whole angle. Either he had zero budget for effects, or he just did not care enough to think of some way to show it. Whatever it was, it should give you an idea of ​​how bad this whole project is. I could not even understand most of the movie, and there was certainly nothing on the screen that was worth half the time. By the end it was as flat as a pancake. A real failure.
