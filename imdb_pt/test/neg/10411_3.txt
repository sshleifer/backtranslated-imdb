A family (a teenager, his mother and a stepfather), tired of life in the city, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. However, his idyll is broken by three brothers and his domineering father, who do not gently accept newcomers on their way. Although having objects thrown out the window and being threatened on the street is just the beginning, the young man decides to make things worse by having a relationship with the sister of the terrible trio. With the law unwilling to do anything about it and violence escalating rapidly, the boy decides to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> Turning wildly between hilarity and meanness, this is one of the strangest exploration films. always done. At first, you can laugh at some of the acting scenes and ridiculous dialogue given to the characters, especially the outlandish bandits. But then you have completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while your son is forced to watch, or the bandit's sister being beaten by his brothers for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole view of women in the film, which seems to be pathetic creatures that scream a lot and can not defend themselves, is rather contemptible. But of course, there is the obligatory nudity scene, which this time involves a young woman diving into a pool without a bra under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about the consistency of the plot when you have some young willing stars ready to spill your clothes. Right ?! <br /> <br /> The climax revolves around the teenager, who until now has not been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly transforming into a clone of Rambo and blowing his assailants to the left, right and center to save. his stepfather being held hostage by the gang. It's completely implausible, but hey, so that's all else in this movie .. so at least you can not accuse him of not being consistent.
