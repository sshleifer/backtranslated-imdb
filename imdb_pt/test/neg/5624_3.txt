I've seen this movie 3 times. Especially because I kept thinking while I watched, "Did I miss something here?" Is there any reason for this movie to have been made? Did you try to say something and I just missed it? Well, after 3 visits I could not come up with an answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about any movie is that it bores me, and I'm not done. I'll admit that there are plenty of eye drops and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the time, but does every movie should be? <br /> <br /> I am not against extreme violence, it is almost non-stop, but it seems there must be some kind of inspiration. Something that stands out for it. The word free comes to mind, but it is worse than that. In the first part of the movie, we all get insight into the characters' motivations. And yes, the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are completely unbelievable. So in the first part, we know the characters, and in the second part most die and use the sadistic joy in killing others. That seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a smart guy like Zed agree to join a bunch of addicts and amateurs to do a job like that? It makes no sense. He is portrayed as intelligent, but continues with this suicidal mission. The fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the violence and the hyper-real chaos. So what are we watching here a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super-real, super-violent bloodbath? I remember having had the same reaction to two other films with which the director was involved: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br /> Dreck unnecessary!
