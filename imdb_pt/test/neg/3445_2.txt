OK, look this show is the worst show on nick @ night. I love so many shows on nick @ night and I love them. When this show hit nick @ night I was so angry. It's such a boring show and it's cheesy. Out of all the times I've watched, I find it a funny little episode. This show has some of the dullest and stupid jokes of all time. This show boils down to terrible. Give props to Fresh Prince of Bel-air and George Lopez. This show is boring and not at all clever. This show should have been canceled long before. I do not think it deserves to be played on nick @ night alongside some great classic shows. This show is lacking in intelligence, good jokes and style.
