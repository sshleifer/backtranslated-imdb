Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of the frayed VHS has a photo of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think the only reason they had a chance to sell the movie in the 90's was because of the name of Sandra Bullock. Bullock fans need not disappoint. Sandra is the only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only one you can call acting. Rest of the movie? It's fun to watch in the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but after that it's all getting worse. Much worse. The direction is horrible. Act is horrible. Script is horrible. Dialogue is horrible. The action is horrible. The music is really good, actually. Typical score for action movies of the eighties. This film is so bad that it comes close to anything Andy Sidaris has ever produced. It is so bad that there are no words to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But there was still Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think now they can take the movie to the DVD. It can be cool! And they should write on the cover: ACADEMY SANDRA BULLOCK AWARD WINNER IN HANGMEN <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
