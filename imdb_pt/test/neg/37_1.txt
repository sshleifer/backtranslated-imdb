The first 20 minutes were a little bit fun because I do not think I've seen such a bad movie before {acting, script, effects (!), Etc ....} The rest of the runtime seemed to drag on forever with each clich√© in the dialogue used to have no effect. These people did not seem to like horror movies or movie making or any other movie. There is no adult language, a little brief nudity, and no blood except false blood scattered over open wounds, etc. It would have been classified as PG in the early eighties and PG-13 nowadays. I'm not sure how you got a R grade or if it really was. I saw the launch of American International titled Hospital Of Terror. I've seen 100 horror movies in the last 12 months and this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here is an example of how bad it is: there is a scene where something green comes through the door. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be, but what's on the screen is green pencil crayons of some kid (I'm not exaggerating) super-imposed on the movie, semi-moving inside the door, so it's supposed to do something for Nurse Sherri to own it, I suppose. I could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.
