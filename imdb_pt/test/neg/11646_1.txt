Stay away from this movie! It's terrible in every way. Bad performance, a fine recycled storyline and the worst ending in film history. I rarely watch a movie that makes my adrenaline escape from irritation, in fact, the only other movie that immediately comes to mind is another "people on a struggling aircraft" movie (aerodynamic speed). Please, please do not watch this one, because it is totally pathetic from beginning to end. Helge Iversen
