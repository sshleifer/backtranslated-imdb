Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It is poor writing combined with poorer performance. You may choose to drink the Gatorade from this special after school, but I did not do it, not even in your philosophy, motivational moment. It's a lot of posture to be fun and not substantial enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program in which this film is inspired, but the movement itself is awful. As a rugby player for almost 20 years in the United States, I expected a better rugby movie (even if it has something to do with rugby). And I can tell you that Haka played by a bunch of Haoles and Islanders is not intimidating (much like when it's played today by the All Blacks, seriously boys, everyone has seen it, it's time to put it aside). If you want real intimidation, stand in front of a group of South Africans (the real criminals convicted of rugby). This is a fake and poorly made movie about being a genuine and good person.
