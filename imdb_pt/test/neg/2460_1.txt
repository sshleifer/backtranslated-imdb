A group of medical student yuppies gather in their spare time to connect to electrical cables and die. Then they count the time before brain death, and then begin CPR and cardiac massage and bring each other back to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in that movie was supposed to say it all. FLATLINERS is like the GHOST group. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead friends, so what better way to do it than to have a lot of medical students kill you for five minutes and then bring it back to life. The rest of the film has predictable "relationship problems" and "GEE MAYBE KEEP KILLING ANOTHER, ONE OF THESE TIMES ONE OF THE US WILL REMAIN DEAD?" D'OH !!! This movie should have been called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were portrayed as Medical Students made me wonder if they had gone to a Foreign Correspondence School to get their diplomas. The only thing that stopped this movie from being a complete laugh was that they did not just stick their fingers into electrical outlets to "die." This movie would have been a great three-way comedy movie.
