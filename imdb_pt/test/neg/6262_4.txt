I've never expected much from a movie of despicable movie director B Jim Wynorski: a silly premise, some cheap effects and a bit of nudity from some big-boobed girls, and I'm usually pretty happy. <br /> Well, the Cheerleader Massacre meets the first and definitely the last, but unfortunately it's a little light when it comes to the splash. And when a movie has the word 'massacre' in the title and scrimps in the blood, then Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's film focuses on a group of cheerleaders who, together with their teacher, mini bus driver and a couple of guys, get stuck in the mountains during a snowstorm. They walk on foot to a deserted mountain refuge, where they find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants everyone dead! From the outset, good old Jim ensures that his film features many scenes loaded with T & A, and includes the obligatory shower scene, along with several other moments when hot women get naked (including obscene sex and a three very free). -babes-in-a-hot-tub scene). None of the women seem young enough to be cheerleaders (and never seen in their clothes), but who cares about these details when they are too willing to undress in the name of art? <br /> <br /> I care, however, with the countless dull deaths of the movie. With such a shocking title, I was waiting for some sort of inventive bloodletting to accompany all the bums, shrubs and breasts; instead, virtually all murders occur off-screen or appear next to non-gore. Only a silly post-beheading scene (obtained with the cheap CGI as the chips) comes close to delivering the goods. <br /> <br /> Even so, if you're in the mood for some excitement, or a bit of foolish slasher minus the grue, then at 82 minutes, at least the Cheerleader Massacre will not be a waste of your time.
