Truly I love Lucy too ... comedy genius yes ... MAME ... NEVER ... she was as ridiculous as Mame ... as was the film adaptation of Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya brotherhood. Both just missed the point completely. Roslind Russell was, is and always will be the first and only Mame. Perhaps as a young star, Ball might have gotten a role like this where his inherent beauty and youth could have put it through ... but this seemed like a desperate attempt by an aging star to show that it was still viable in the field. . The reason why there are so many supporters of Russell's version (other than the fact that you can not improve the original) is that Russell had presence, she absorbs all scenes while Lucille Ball could be a pattern on the wallpaper in Mame. all the attention she commands on paper.
