The real surprise of this film is light and effortless as this high-ranking cast has gathered for what is nothing more than an uninspired affair. Presumably, it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill, gathering pace, size and shape. One can imagine that at the time Miranda Richardson was contacted by her agent, the conversation followed the lines of: 'Do you want to film a film in Dublin written by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already there! This is a boring comedy that causes Michael Caine and Dylan Moran to try to make a well-planned deal where Moran must imitate a London gang boss (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a sizable sum of money from local boss Michael Gambon . The rest is simply a forgettable joke that thankfully ended quickly. Moran is slightly entertaining in some places, but this evidence is more suited to small screen life in hit comedies like Black Books. Caine is not challenged in his role and gives a stable performance without being overwhelmed. One can imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it may not even have been a summer in Dublin, given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background. Gambon really steals the show, and anyone who has picked up some of their performances in the likes of Have I Got News For You will know that he is a wonderfully funny man. But overall, the result is disappointing, and it seems like a lifetime ago Neil Jordan was making quality films like Mona Lisa.
