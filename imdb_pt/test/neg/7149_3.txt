I was in this movie as an extra in the filming of Dallas in July 1975. Some of the things you see today, and give as guaranteed in the movies, were implemented in this film. The premise of the film, the costumes, the special effects, the acting. Everything was ahead of its time. He opened the door to such films as "Star Wars," "Terminator," "Matrix," and "X-Men." Now people look at it and say, "Well, that does not add up to this new special effects story ..." It had no computer graphics and like the new movies these days. He had a wonderful story and cast, and a great director! The places were filmed as the Dallas World Trade Center, the Zale Building and the Ft. The Worth Water Gardens were, at the time, the most modern and futuristic scenarios for filming. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and tried to show a perfect future that was imperfect by human desires and fragility. It was my first cinematic experience, the first of six movies I've been to. Just because it was filmed in Texas is no less a wonderful piece of filmmaker art. Watch again and enjoy more. This film was the foundation that set the standard for many great movies that we now enjoy. Well, my hand is blinking ... I have to run. Sanctuary awaits ...
