I'm almost ashamed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to deny it). The direction is worse. Most of the film is comprised of long-range plans interspersed with close-ups interspersed with transverse cuts of mostly non-erotic pornography (most prevalent, of course, in the "uncut" version). Cinematography is especially insignificant, giving all production an inexpensive appearance that weakens some of the elaborate designs. The movie should have looked much better. The general concept of putting actors' names on what would have easily been a pornographic film (Guccione called it "paganography") runs out after the first hour after the departure of Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud. Bob Guccione obviously spent a lot of money on it, but everything seems like a huge waste. If you want a much better understanding of the Roman Empire in the first century, watch the BBC production in the mid-'79s, CLAUDIUS instead ... and if you want pornography, do jeeze-louise, look elsewhere .
