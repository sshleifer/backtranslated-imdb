But like the Disney film of two generations ago, this film also fails in the precision department. But at least Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the story true to filmmakers? I think not. There is ample documentation to accurately portray the true story, rather than the fictional accounts we had to go through. <br /> <br /> Someday, a movie will properly portray Bobby's owner John Gray as the Edinburgh cop he was, and correctly portray Bobby's license being paid by Lord Provost. When that happens, I'll be in theaters.
