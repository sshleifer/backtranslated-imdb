I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this Bunuel movie (with some ideas from Dali) made me cold. Bunuel had a grudge against the Catholic Church and delighted in offending Catholics in a rather silly way. This is one of the most foolish; almost like what you'd expect from a crafty 18-year-old kid in film class. The last minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a last touch on religion. <br /> <br /> If you read the "scholars" about this slow, occasionally entertaining movie, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If this is really the point, Bunuel expresses it as routinely as possible. The central male character is an unpleasant brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking down blind men on the street, and who mentally turns ads into billboards into bizarre sexual fantasies. Is this the church's fault (for disrupting his sex act) or is he just an idiot? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had many personal problems and chose Catholics to be guilty. <br /> <br /> There are moments when you can cry: "Aha! Surrealism!": A cow in a bed, a giraffe falling through a window (a poor model), a man ripping a feather pillow, a woman washing a toilet while watching images of boiling lava (or a mud pit ... difficult to say in B / W). The rest is forgetful self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel still pursued the same bogus for the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreto Charme ...). If you are interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau's initial work.
