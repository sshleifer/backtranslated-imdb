Firstly, Katherine Hepburn is ragged as Clara. She simply can not be convincing as the devoted, altruistic, and somewhat sarcastic wife the writers have created. <br /> <br /> But the real weakness of the film is its superficiality in the face of a potentially large piece of drama. . Schumann's bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) equals "Oh, oh, I have a headache" and the occasional angry word. Suicide? The word is used but there are no signs of this in domestic scenes and when we see him in the psychiatric hospital he is calm, restrained, smiling and optimistic. A superficial treatment. And Brahms is so correct and bourgeois - no sign of his harsh humor, his love of tinkering with the establishment's nostrils, no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women as he spent his youth playing the piano in brothels. And was Clara's long concert career merely promoting Robert's music, or was she, in fact, a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself, a pianist who carved out a place for herself in a masculine world? Any kind of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none, but this is a standard Hollywood approach, particularly disappointing because the actual story is much more dramatic, much more interesting, much more. more human.
