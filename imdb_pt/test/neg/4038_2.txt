This is without a doubt the STUPIDEST movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I do not know who I'm most annoyed at - the idiots who made this or my video store for really carrying that crap! ! <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to name all the wrong things with this horrible movie of wanting. <br /> <br /> The whole dialogue seems like it was invented on the spot, and the acting is the worst I've ever seen in any movie-EVER !! <br /> <br /> There is nothing about the script that attracts any decent person, in fact I do not think they even had a script, they just invented everything as they were - and you can tell. <br /> <br /> The "women" (ie, men dressed in drag trying to look like women) in the costumes looked so ridiculous, I think they were trying to be sexy but - NOT SO! Especially that disgusting old woman. <br /> <br /> There is nothing scary about this movie, the only scary thing is that someone can actually rent it and have to watch it. <br /> <br /> No brain needed to watch this, you must be a total loser to want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not forget - I warned you !!!
