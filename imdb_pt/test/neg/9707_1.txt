If you've never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or BBC adaptation of 1995, or even seen a pop-up version of the book, then this attempt to showcase this classic love story can be considered vaguely bearable. From the opening scene, this movie must be remembered for its terrible acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of Jane Austen's classic wit. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who has obviously never heard of Jane Austen, much less read, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and smiles at every scene, and it seems so nasty that no one wants to marry her! Darcy seemed to be trying to remember her lines throughout the film, and the rest of Bennet's girls were interchangeable failing to portray their characters as they were originally written. <br /> <br /> This version failed to show proper Pride and Prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered and, at the end of the two hours longest of my life, that they cared whether they joined or not! Absolutely abysmal - even the few minutes of Judi Dench can not save this rubbish. I can not think of anything good to say about this movie beyond what it eventually ended up!
