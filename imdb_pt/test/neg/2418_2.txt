Where to start? This movie is a lot of fun if you are new to the wonderful rugby game, however, if you live outside the US and follow the game, it is laughable. Various rugby traditions, such as "Haka", which is pre-formed by New Zealand "All Blacks" and only by the All Blacks. The Haka leader is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and was misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is very well directed, but it is the poor script and the overall execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is based on a real story, has a lot of clich√©s in the plot. I strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this movie and see what rugby really is on Youtube because the rugby pictured in this movie has been distorted and distorted so far from it really is.
