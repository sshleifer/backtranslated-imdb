Okay with Coolio, I should have known better! But Noooooooo. <br /> <br /> Within 3 minutes you found 5 bites from other movies and TV shows ... <br /> <br /> 8 minutes Casper Van Dien should have learned now! <br /> <br /> 10 minutes you feel sorry for Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr. that he was reduced to making movies like that. <br /> <br /> 15 mins Erika Eleniak Appears as Zena. <br /> <br /> 20 minutes you're ready to shoot yourself ... <br /> <br /> How these films get funding is beyond me! And yes I watched the whole thing. The end is invaluable !!! Just stay away!
