I just watched the last film of the K-Laurel and Hardy Atoll and known here in the Utopia as the Utopia-on Internet Archive, hoping to see some extra scenes, since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that it's basically the same version I watched earlier on the VHS tape of Goodtimes Home Video that ran for an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of the non-placement of Welch's Grape Juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest execution time dedicated to dark white space. While Stan looks like he may be dying soon, he still makes a good physical comedy with Ollie for most of the first 45 minutes. So the plot to take a yacht with a clandestine passenger and a man without a country on board - not to mention a charming French singer who also lives on an unknown island, everything ends - with possible complications that practically stir the comedy. down and never recovers, despite Ollie's final end by saying to Stan for the last time, "Here's another cool mess you got me into!" before Stan cried uncontrollably before fading. In other words, if you are a diehard fan of Laurel and Hardy, this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. Anyone else who wants to get acquainted with this classic comedy team should look up the previous work they did for Hal Roach from the 1920s to the 1940s when they completed their last Roach movie, Saps at Sea. Come to think of it, even some of the L & H Fox movies (yet to see the two that made it to MGM) from the 40's are better than this ... Update-8/29/09: I just watched a few missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and talks to the captain. In another, the captain's wife points a gun at Cherie. In another, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is voiced in high pitch here!
