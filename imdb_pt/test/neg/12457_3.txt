"Tart" is a pathetic attempt to make movies that wander and among a bunch of Manhattan teenagers exploring all the common things of adolescence ... sex, drugs and classical music almost completely without history, focus or purpose. Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes while Swain obediently works through another in his long list of dog movies. Nothing in this movie works and Wayne should consider getting a real job. Not recommended for anyone. PU! Ugh! (D)
