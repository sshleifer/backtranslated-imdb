I was drawn to this film by its unusual and unobtrusive "real life" line. That is, a guy in his twenties falls in the Big Apple and returns home to live with his parents and even his brother with more floppy. It may have worked, but there is a problem. And the name of this problem is Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. Your acting mantra should be "exerting as little effort as possible at all times". Or "why talk when you can mutter?" Or maybe "go into coma as soon as the camera rotates". Lips moving when speaking? Evil. Facial expressions? None. Muscles in the face? Stunted. Something? Anything. Anything? Zip lock.
