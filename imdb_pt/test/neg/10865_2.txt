Okay, so writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to produce his own film and fill the cast with flashy names. Good for it! Now what he really still needs is the inspiration and talent to create a worthwhile scenario instead of the overly pretentious and pretentious crap he wrote here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; is a frenetic and inept fan-boy endeavoring to honor the famous 1960s motorcycle movies and the newly revived Grindhouse movie formula in general. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop fails in his set-up and there are many obvious reasons for this. Does not he have a story to tell? or at least not very interesting? but gravely tries to cover it up with innumerable redundant twists and turns, free and very hostile sleaze charges to women, long and pious dialogues that aspire to be a cold, gigantic amount of senseless violence. The plot seems complex, but can be summed up in one sentence. The old revenge between two rival motorcycle gangs ignites again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not be the long-lost son of a double-crossing girl who was executed in 1976. That's it, seriously! Everything else, from betraying gang members to recruiting former members of the timer to playing with his nymphomaniac girl, is completely useless and confusing. Another major problem in "Hell Ride" is Larry Bishop's own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego. He definitely should not have been rewarded with the role of tough and ruthless gang leader, since this just seems incredibly pretentious and narrow-minded; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie. Granted, Bishop starred in some genuine 1960s motorcycle exploration films (such as "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but that was a long time ago and he honestly is not anything good as an actor. Maybe it was simply the dream of Bishop's life to play a character who always outgrows his enemies and that every hottie wants sexually, and just wrote a whole script about it. Casting veterans, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, do not bother to leave a plausible impression and I can not say I blame them. All this production is lame and pathetic and I can not recommend it to anyone, regardless of how many pretty girls parade with naked breasts and naked asses.
