Many people have said that this was a great film with Hoffman performing well. I went from suspended disbelief, to restless boredom, almost coming out. there is no there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman does it all. he is committed to performance. but sometimes he playing an affected man looks like the affected actor chewing the scene. <br /> <br /> No character in the movie besides the cloak is much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of the cloak. shows them so many times that I began to wonder why - do the filmmakers think we need to clear it all up? and again? and again? often refers to the cloak genius, but does not show it. shows him surrounded by fans and sycophants, but he never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> But my goal is not to deconstruct the film. I'm sure the others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that looked like five.
