OK, let's see ... a handsome young man is new to town and walks the local boardwalk. He meets a pretty girl, meets the detestable leader of the local club of young hip vampires, is challenged by them to follow them in this cave, enters into a conflict over the beautiful girl, an epic struggle follows ... /> <br /> No, it's not Lost Boys, although you have difficulty telling the difference, since I think even a little of the carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties for trying a movie?) Even the end of this stink is ripped from Lost Boys. The makeup is below standard even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional and exactly how many "Oh, I've had that horrible experience" scenes of teen angst what a movie needs? The humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is sadly predictable. To yawn. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that, hopefully, every distributor in the country will lead.
