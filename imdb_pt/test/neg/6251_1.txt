Even as a big fan of low or no budget horror genre, I could not find this slightly fun disaster. With horrible acting, a painfully generic "plot" and no dimensional character, no matter how bored and drunk you are, it's not worth your 81 minutes. Do not make the same mistake I did. Rent something else. Anything else!!!
