I have seen kung fu cheese fight movies. Living in Taiwan they come instead of sitcoms in America. I've seen movies make fun of themselves, but this movie belongs to the sad category of fighting movies that try too hard with horrible actors, horrible props and horrible music to be taken seriously. I felt sorry for the person who composed the song for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to produce crap like what I thought should have been titled "Ninja Generic Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations of a Bandit Pointing a Gun to a Girl's Head When leaning on a corner "or the daring" flight of the helicopter. " Then the fight scenes are over and the credits rolled. Those really had me in tears laughing. If the "special effects" were not enough proof that this was low-budget, the fact that only two or three crew members, presumably locals who, though good for the much-needed Filipino economy, were probably only meant to save money , I've done something since this series of films. They rented equipment, despite making sequences for this movie. That was very funny too. The thing that really made me go away was not the music (which got me kind of expecting a lively Sargeant Slaughter from GI Joe to appear) but the ending ... I suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to but when the American Ninja leaves the girl in Jackson's arms and takes off the mask, I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson let go of the girl to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.
