It is a film that sheds light on the beginning of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but does not show the real feelings of the people at that time and how they were led to believe that they could return to their home soon, does not mention the massacres committed by the Jews like Der Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter who lacks credibility about the real Palestinian struggle and about anything Palestinian, but there is something about the suffering of Jews. Palestinian citizens end up as refugees in neighboring Arab countries, the film focuses on the story of the comatose man he is now in and through his history, we see the film. The movie is just telling a person's life and has some nudity scenes that are irrelevant to the story.
