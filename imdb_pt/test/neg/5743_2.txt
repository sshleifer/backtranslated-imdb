This is a relatively watchable movie (+1). After watching UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this looks good by comparison. There are no obvious technical gaffes, though the vampiric teeth look strange. <br /> <br /> The plot does not make sense. We will see. An American soldier fights vampires. Back to the states and is rehabilitated by seeing ... Vampires. Your commander is your ex-wife's aunt. Who happens to be doing some research on the biodiversity of the South American area where vampires are. There is! Do not accumulate many coincidences. Who cares about the vampire in the head? Or his daughter? Or anyone in this movie? The only originality of this is that most myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, which can not go out during the day, etc.) are wrong. But, they can not be killed except by decapitation or a wood wound in the heart. Okay, right. It is obvious that they did not want to film a dark movie, since this is a movie made for TV. <br /> <br /> It would have been good for the viewer if they had hired some actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (TV Wonder Woman), and a big black guy with a tremendously deep voice, who growls appropriately to show off her vampire teeth prosthesis. But otherwise you would never know that they actually paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough fighting scenes, and some vampire neck blood, but no real violence.
