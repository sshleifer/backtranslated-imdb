If you want to see someone accidentally eating another man's testicle, or looking at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or hearing a man talk about how good it is to have sex with a girl while she vomits, then this is the movie for you. Alternating, neck-breaking fashion, between romantic and crude comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays Horatio Sanz's wife (tell me another) that is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is surprisingly no nudity. Jake Busey is completely revolting as a hunting dog that you would not want as your friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the movie is too busy trying to dislike being good.
