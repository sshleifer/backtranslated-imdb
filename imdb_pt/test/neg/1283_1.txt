This movie must enter the annals of the fiefdom as one of the worst of all time. I'll stop saying it's the worst movie ever, just because I have not seen all the movies already made. I can not make such high statements until then. The story is obsolete, the acting is horrible, at best, the "special" effects are no more than a couple of pounds. dry ice and a fan. Someone must have been related to someone to make this movie. Mr. Busey sent this one! The dog is well trained and handsome, making it the only redeeming quality in this movie he should never have done. Two hours and $ 3 of my life I will never go back.
