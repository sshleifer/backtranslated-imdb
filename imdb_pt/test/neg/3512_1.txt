This movie was horrible and in the end made me wonder why anyone bothered to do it. Now it was not all bad, I studied film and this movie was very well organized and had very good cinematic all with interesting angles for very good lighting and excellent camera work. I wish I had seen it back in school because I would have made a good movie to write an article. BUT ........ Since I graduated and lost most of my cinematic pretentiousness, I realized that a movie should be fun above all, this movie was long and boring and I'm not sure when it it finally got to the point that it was well worth my time. <br /> <br />
