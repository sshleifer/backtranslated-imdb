This is as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could do, I suppose. A group of medical students take turns to die for several minutes; After the revival, they discover that their sins have manifested themselves in some form or another. As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences, it is unclear exactly what the connection is, but the visions seem to be sixth grade art films. Why students treat their experience as a kind of great journey that will make them famous is a mystery, as the results are completely unlikely and, as the film mentions several times, have been documented many times before. Still, it's good to see Schumacher practicing for his Batman train wrecks with some of the old neon paint and colored lamps. And William Baldwin is a board.
