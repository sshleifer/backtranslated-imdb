Wow!! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention terrible? You can only say by the DVD cover to not get this movie, but unfortunately that was not the case for me. Well someone brought this house for me to watch and when I looked at it I just wanted to strangle the person because they used my money. I will certainly be catching it back soon, but I may well talk about it while I have it in my memory, as I definitely want to forget. This movie does not deserve to even be called horrible. It's beyond horrible. Quite possibly, the worst movie of all time. The acting was so, so, so, so horribly disgusting, as well as the deaths being so INCREDIBLY lame and predictable. I did not even laugh at how bad this movie was, which scares me a bit. I do not see this movie, ashamed of you if you are even looking at this page of the movie, and I have EXTREME pity for you if you are looking at this page of the movie because you think this will be DECENT. Final Word: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
