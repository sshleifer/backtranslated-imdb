It used to be that video distributors like Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films were releasing low-budget horror movies and filmed for a select market of gorehounds that devoured them with joy. This is acceptable to me because you can see these movies a mile away with your crappy gear art and cheesy titles. <br /> <br /> Now we have the Lions Gate coming into the mix, only they have decided to be better for sucker in poor juices by putting a "professional" cover on it and charging the same price as one of the larger features budget, professionally made. Do not be fooled by it! Granted, if you've seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there's a place for movies like this and it's not on a video store shelf next to professionally made features. <br /> <I'm a fan of independent cinema and watched a number of low-cost, video-filmed productions that were still worth renting, but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The "acting" (if you can call it that) was awful. It was fun to laugh at the awful reading of the line for a minute or two, but in the end it was too much and it was unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow manages to be even worse. The only saving grace possible for this would be a gut scene that can still be horrible, but it's a rewarding effect when compared to blood splatters after a girl is slapped or a mannequin beheaded. <br /> <br /> I three tries to go through the whole movie and I just did it because I paid good money to rent it and felt that I should at least finish the movie to the end. Stay away - stay away, away from it.
