First of all, I've been a big Bronson fan since the late 70's. I watched all the movies he's done on the big screen since "Love and Bullets," which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, the star Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I kept expecting things to become around him, that he would make a very good movie in the 80's, but that never happened. And I do not know what he was thinking when he signed with cheap studio Jack Cannon and cut director J. Lee Thompson for most of his recent films. <br /> <br /> "Assasination" gave me some hope when I saw that Peter Hunt was driving instead of Thompson, but those hopes were quickly thwarted. First of all, the film looks incredibly cheap, as if it had been made for about 3,000, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard he insisted on 5,000 per image, which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his Cannon films). The White House scenes were filmed on the grounds of the VA in West LA - I was catching the bus when they were filming. Nice work on recreating the white house, but no one thought of taking the palm trees off the shots? I think not. <br /> <br /> Second, the support cast is very bad. Ireland was dying of cancer, and yet it was not bad, but the horrible Asian woman playing Bronson's helper was typical of Cannon's talent at the time - nonexistent. I would be very curious to know how she got that role. I can not imagine a worse actress for the role, but she's a good 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not all that bad and it's something that bigger studios and budgets did best after (Eastwood's "In the Line of Fire" and Costner's "Bodyguard"), but the way it's staged here is really sad . I'm wondering if they could not do more than one or two takes per shot. None of this is believable at all. If the Secret Service men really behaved like the main cops in this movie, we'd have presidents coming out of the office (and life) every few months ...
