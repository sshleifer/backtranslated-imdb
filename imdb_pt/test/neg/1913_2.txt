I rented this movie the other day b / c I love romance stories, but this has to be the worst I've ever seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after they have said no more than two words when she has a great longtime boyfriend who is devoted to her completely. I thought Kelley was a big jerk all through the movie, and he never changed anything. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did a great job as an actress, and I'm going to start watching more of his movies.
