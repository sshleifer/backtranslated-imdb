The plot involves a new franchise barber shop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So he feels he has to change and improve his store, getting more new things and such. It sounds very exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, a lot involves the same material from the first film. Calvin's people stay around, talk loudly and talk to each other and to customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was a bit funny, but it's more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie. And Calvino is faced with another moral issue involving a large sum of money. He has already shown that he will do the right thing in the end. <br /> <br /> FINAL TRUTH: Nothing new. I would not recommend unless you think the first Barber Shop was the best thing since the sliced ​​bread.
