I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa. I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx. 85 miles. I did not know anything about the plot or the players. I had not read any criticism or talked to anyone who had seen it. Believe me, I will never make that mistake again. It was being considered as the first feature film filmed in the new 3D process. That's what lured me into a 170-mile round-trip. There was a double waiting line that stretched (I'm not kidding) with 2 or 2 Â½ blocks in length and moving very slowly. I could wait to be seated. If I knew right then what I would know, I might be on my way back to Youngstown when the movie starts. <br /> <br /> When the first 3D scene was shown, I was already dozing. The novelty quickly wore off and from there it was pure agony. <br /> <br /> Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice. If you've ever seen the famous movie PLAN NOVE DE OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst film ever filmed, in my humble opinion is head and shoulders above this garbage. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this has ever been shown on TV, if I do not know why. If you have the chance to see it, do something else. Take a walk, mow the lawn, wash the dog, ask someone to whip you with a rubber hose. ANYTHING. Your time will have been better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first film review. It may well be my last unless a worse movie appears and I did not make the book that will happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
