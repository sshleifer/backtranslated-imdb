I made the mistake of watching "Dark Star" (1974) late at night many years ago. It was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen: 1. Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid plot. (Destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or on the way will only make things worse: instead of having a large and easily avoidable object, you will have thousands of smaller objects, but equally lethal and harder to track. <br /> 4. Completely unreal characters. A beach ball painted as a space alien? Writers must be doing a lot of drugs. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, most of the actors in "Dark Star" have never done anything else. Of those who did something else, most never acted again after Dark Star. So having Dark Star in the acting resume was a death star for the acting career!
