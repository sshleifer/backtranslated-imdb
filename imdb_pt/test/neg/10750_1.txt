Some people found this funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this play. I, however, am so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I can not tolerate propaganda from either side. I was hoping for a horror show, but I got "cuddly" zombies and partisan bull shit. I watch my horror movies to be afraid. That did not even try to be scary. Also, this does not have Romero's wit in his political / cultural satire in his films ... this was a blatant, unimaginative story that was difficult for me to stretch (for the wrong reasons). On the bright side, if you hate Bush ... you're going to love it (I'm not apologizing for the hatred or Bush with that statement)
