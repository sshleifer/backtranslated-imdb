I love musicals, all of them, from gay Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the romantic touching "Damn Yankees." And I know most of the songs, singing them sometimes spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical, unlike this vaudeville show, every song is meticulously crafted to fit. the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, repentance, love, joy or exaltation - a natural extension where mere words fail. So in Guys and Dolls, "My Time of Day" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson, who is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. All the songs of this genius exemplar create a mood, or develop a character, creating a place phantasmagoria, made absolutely believable by the evocative self-revelations of music. <br /> <br /> For this lover of Broadway musical and his adaptations to the screen during the latter half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel distortion of the house of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply taken from a collection, only interfered with the unstable premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the viewers who are making this film into monumental success simply have no exposure to the film. the art form of 20th century musicals. They have no idea of ​​the magic performed by the writer and lyricist who can turn a dance hall into someone we know and love, as was achieved in "Sweet Charity." <br /> <br /> Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Maybe, another day, another mood, I might have gotten into that, and have not been so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can not help but wonder what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein and Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and many others could have done with this silly premise. I think about this while the memories of watching this movie are new, and I can not help but regret the great loss.
