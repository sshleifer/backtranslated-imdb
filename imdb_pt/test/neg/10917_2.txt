It takes an eternity for this typically simplistic, jerk-based Stephen King movie to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half an hour is wasted on unnecessary introductions to several boring characters and their small irrelevant personal problems that can excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soap dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or so I thought naively). The mutt ceases to seem so fearsome that Leonard Maltin, notoriously clueless and hopeless and always smiling film critic, would disagree: he considers Cujo to be "genuinely scary." (I often have to wonder if Maltin is really thick - or just likes to do favors for his Hollywood friends ...) It is illogical and inconsistent how Wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury. And, of course, her car breaks down when she needs to save her life: this is one of the oldest cliches of horror movies; Rely on King to use the minimal effect. The premise is stupid, too banal, even for a horror movie: a rabid turncoat attacks a family. It is? This kind of thing hardly constitutes a 3-minute sub-sub-plot in your average zombie movie. I think even Cujo must have realized that he was starring in a turkey. Mutts have terrible agents ... But what I do not really understand is how people can actually play in the book "Cujo" and read it from cover to cover? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, that is, why they treat time as a nonsense commodity. <br /> <br /> Body count: 3.
