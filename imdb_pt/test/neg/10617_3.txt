I watched this movie that I actually thought it had a promising start, but this led me to be disappointed in the end. The problem I find with this movie is that the director was trying a little hard to make this movie strange and original. There were many flashbacks and many bad "effects" that irritated me during the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they let me down in this movie, they could have done a lot better. This movie looked promising at first, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end. The film never surpassed the genius of Stanley Kubrick when it comes to controversial subjects, strangeness and originality in the films.
