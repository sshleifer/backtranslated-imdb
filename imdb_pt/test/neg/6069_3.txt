I am a music lover and was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to leave in the middle of the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which meant that I did not care what happened to them and I lost interest in the story altogether. On the bright side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so that was part of the bearable film. Also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost rescued the entire movie, but they could not sustain me until the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work on, but the script was not suitable to make it remotely interesting. The little bit about "washing me" was total crap. I wonder how many takes the actors had to do in that one (I would not be able to say those lines without laughter). Anyway, a shame, it could have been so much better.
