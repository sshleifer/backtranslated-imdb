Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It's a shame that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 60's due to mistreatment by the producers, and MacNee probably regretted it as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show could have lasted the other way around. Linda Thorson was fine as a substitute and her episodes still retained almost all the quality and aspects of Rigg episodes - it lacked only Rigg / Macnee chemistry. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and who the hell is this guy, Gambit. Also, the humor was forced and poor - I just watched some of the episodes, because that was all I COULD watch, but I think I got the idea. Try as much as possible and it's almost impossible to resurrect an old program like a new format or movie.
