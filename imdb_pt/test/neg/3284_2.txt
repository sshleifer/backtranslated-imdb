I cringed when I heard the first clue of canned laughter in the first few seconds of the show, but I still gave it a try. You KNOW when someone offers a phrase that is just a little fun and you hear an obviously fake laughing lane bursting into noisy laughter which is a show aimed at idiots who need to be said "yes, it's funny, go ahead and laugh." /> <br /> Ugh. I could not stand this show as he revealed himself. I can not speak for everyone - after all, some people really like this IDIOTIC "Stacked" (which makes me want to vomit). I can imagine that those who like Stacked also like that. Some people still amuse themselves with the old "pull my finger" gag. For me, this show is almost as witty - and almost as original. <br /> <br /> The themes were old and tired. The jokes were thighs and banal. The characters were the ones we saw everywhere before - and the worst of all you can imagine. <br /> <br /> So ... if you like things like burps of words and neighbors that say "pull my finger." you may really like this show. Otherwise ... go through it. It's stupid - not in a clever or original way. This is as old and tired as any show ever was in its debut.
