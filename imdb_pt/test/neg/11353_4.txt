"Mararía" really disappointed me. I can not consider it as a bad movie, but the development seemed too rushed and unbelievable to evoke emotions. Dr. Fermin exhibits an unprecedented bizarre behavior, a passion that one can not really understand from where he was born. I mean, how many times has he talked to Mararia? Maybe once? In addition, Mararía never seemed to be a real character, but rather a stereotype of film that only needed to be in the film (or another title was necessary?). Some of the best performances came from a role that was not really important to the story, that of Martial, the sub-intelligent but humble drunk. Of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the Canary Islands and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film fell short of a documentary (in case that is its real intention) and, more importantly, as a solid drama.
