I saw it late at night on a smaller channel and put it on for a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I thought he could be a good comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I could not be more wrong. This concert was horrible. It was full of racist remarks aimed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence's narrow mind) and clandestine clich√© cod philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, do not resist the desire of preach when given a platform. Do we really need a talk about Martin Luther King and the civil rights fight during a stand-up comedy show?). Then there were his flattering comments designed to please him with the women, made my skin crawl by listening to him. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the show just was not funny and I found it annoying. I turned in half and came back to find him or even preaching or talking about the birth of his son (there was no humor in the story of his son's birth and he was self-indulgent on his part). to get bored with the details. He clearly did not have much to say or he would have cut off that part of the program. <br /> <br /> This show was crap: Runteldat!
