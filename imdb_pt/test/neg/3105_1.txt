In fact, I'm too drained to write this review - bad movies always do that to me - but I feel compelled, as if it were my civic duty, to warn anyone who is thinking of buying or watching this terrible mess. -a photo. Please, please, just take my word: this is one of those that you will want to stay away from. It's so boring and monotonous, so insipid and uninspired, such a bad excuse to bring together any family talent. Burt Reynolds? Wasted (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is barely in the movie, and when he appears onscreen his performance is so restrained and change that it becomes clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by Ice's intense gaze, did not know what to do with him. Rob Lowe, as the title character, has never shown so little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. Certainly, Satan himself signed Mario's check for this movie. The plot is as weak, half boiled and boring as all the music involved (the club's boring music seems to literally continue for the first third of the movie). The look of the film will cause someone to seriously question whether the cinematographer was also forced, as one of the film's forgettable female characters, to crack crack from a tube glued to his mouth. And if you're looking for, at least for stylized shoot-up violence, you will not have any here. This movie, I assure you, I promise you, Absolutely no redeeming quality! Please, I beg of you, Avoid this movie! Do not put this down and be fooled into believing that your pace will improve, will improve and evolve to a decent outcome. Will not. Not that. Can not! Sucks! Now you have been warned, and now I can go to bed (it's three o'clock - please forgive any resulting errors that this admonition may contain) - to know that my conscience is clear, because I have done my civic duty with my fellow men!
