This movie is horrible. If you are thinking of watching this movie ... two words NO. It's insipid, the plot is really lame, and the jokes are even worse. The acting is really pathetic. I can not believe this movie was made. Instead, watch American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you're in the mood for a teen comedy. It's about two girls going to Malibu on their spring break. As usual, they did not do much planning and called the uncle (I think she names Michelle) to knock on their mansion in Malibu. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them from having any kind of party, and as you might imagine, they go ahead and do this. Please, please do not watch this movie.
