A complicated stupidity that the cartoon "Bullwinkle" made fun of a quarter of a century beforehand, "NO DEAD HEROES" proves that you can rip a good movie (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) without copying a quality fragment of the object of your loot . Bad acting is recorded on the cable TV scale, the plot has fewer nuances than an old comic "Sgt. Rock", and only the "Boris J. Badanov" style mustaches are missing in the Commies. This film achieves the unusual feat of being too bad, too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposable thumbs.
