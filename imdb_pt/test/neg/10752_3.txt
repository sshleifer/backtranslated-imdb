One critic says that those who did not like this movie "will only be appreciated by moviegoers who get tired of movies as fun." This, I feel, is quite unfair to those of us who find it annoying. <br /> <br /> I did not get tired or disappoint myself with movies or with filmmakers, but I found this tedious and self-indulgent. But then, it's true, I'm not very big in deep meaning. I feel it can have great significance for those who know, you know. <br /> <br /> It is very slow and it spends a lot of time trying to make its individual points, using images, in fact, to do so. But on days like these, it seems possible that a movie like this might be the kind of thing you'd find in one of those dark and scary booths in modern art galleries rather than on the screen of a popular movie theater. .
