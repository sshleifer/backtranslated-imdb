Spoiler notice !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite movie of Cary Grant. I spent most of my time thinking: ignore it, leave it etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he convinces her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from the check-in of some books that this is a read that some viewers / critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way of filming a book than changing the ending - and this is a more irrational end change than, for example, in Altman's The Good Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of making the killer not the killer because a star was climbed (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the end of the book is definitely not ruled out. In Robin Hitchcock's Films Revisited, he writes: "When a 'swiches' mentally ends, the significance of each scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of 'reality' of fiction disintegrates , the film becomes a "modernist" text, in which the narrative process is in the foreground. "I like to play intellectual interpretation games as much as any other, but unless the film is in direct reading, then failure. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal milk cups that are repeated in some Hitchcock movies. <br /> A boring pun. The year is 1941. Nothing in the movie says it's set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris bank, and goes there to do financial business? Does not he know there's a war? In fact, was there still a flight from Croydon airport? Is he in good relations with the Nazis? How is it never suggested that the Germans threw him as a spy or something? <br /> <br /> A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained or presented - a woman in a tuxedo. Credits say she is Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is not this an example of how lesbians were coded in the '40s movies? Should we take her as Isobel's lover? Books discussing gay / lesbian open and hidden in Hitchcock (for example, Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
