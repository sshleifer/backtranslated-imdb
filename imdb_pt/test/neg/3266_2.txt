Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself, but compared to the original, it can not stack. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while Funny just can not compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character in the original. Most of the other characters in the film do not have the touch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon, for example), except for hysterical and funny lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Each phrase he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office (I'm not going to lawsuits or moves. I find out where you live and come to your house and knock your door down with a ** baseball bat, do a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe bake that golden retriever (arff arff arff), then eat it And then I'm climbing upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs your brand new BMW up your a tight **! Do we have an understanding?). However, counterbalancing his small role is Dan Acroyd, who obviously does not replace Bill Murray. His voice is beyond annoying and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. Overall, the Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the original fantastic it just can not cut it.
