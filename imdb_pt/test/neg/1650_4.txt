A frenetic, somewhat petty, witty childish humor is plentiful in this town boy who has become a farmer's tale. It is not scandalous enough to attract the public Will Ferrell, and is not interesting enough to take the length of the appeal. The most that I can praise "Son In Law" would be to say that, most of the time, it avoids the mood of the bathroom. The main problem is that all the characters have no heat, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a very unpleasant hero. There are some fun bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, which exists, is so simplistic and predictable that it makes "Jury Duty" look like "Gone with the Wind." - MERK
