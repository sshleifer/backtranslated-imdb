What you need In the run-up to "What You Need", every episode since "The Lonely" has been to some extent a winner. This episode is the first major failure since 'Escape Clause'. Serling's script is again based on someone else's material, a tale by Lewis Padgett. As in "And when the sky was opened," Serling significantly altered the content, removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly street vendor. <br /> <br /> "What you need" works best when it's being sweet. The initial half, in which the peddler offers clients in a bar objects they will need in the near future, has a gentle charm about him, which may have worn out for an entire episode, but works well within the set time frame. Unfortunately, the main plot he rides is full of holes. The minute Steve Cochran's performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus, the episode falls apart. Cochran's part is a subscript stereotype and his performance plan highlights this flaw. His exploration of the old peddler is monotonous and predictable and the revelation that he is going to kill the old man is totally unconvincing, making the whole scene of slippery shoes look completely fake. Ernest Truex is good as the peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm edge to the character, but he is not good enough to help the devious script. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. For example, we have learned that the power of the peddler to provide people with what they need has to do with the future. So, just like this allows him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses. This seems like it should be a bit out of your power realms. In addition, for a man who can see the future, the hawker is certainly surprised to find the bad guy waiting for him in his apartment. There are many other holes that can be picked in "What You Need", but it is not worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it.
