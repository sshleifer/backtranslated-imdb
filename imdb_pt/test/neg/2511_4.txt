Alien body thieves in the desert. Small blue stones that appear to be made of cheap plastic. The overall plot is not bad if you like that sort of thing, but the acting is a lot more than bad, which surprises me that some of them actually entertained me in The X Files! And the special effects? Hello?! Where did they get their FX team from high school? I mean, come on. there was so much more they could have done! He was amateur and extremely basic. I particularly did not like it (and my father slept during it!) And of course our hero falls in love with the protagonist! It is so typical and highly predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
