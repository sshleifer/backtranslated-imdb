I watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time. Emmerdale's girl, she was fat, so yes, she must have been fat, my friend, but no one lost weight. <br /> <br /> As Itv made a big mistake with that. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I feel like the whole show was just about great people trying to lose weight but they never did, so they tried to have a love story oh my god that is a waste of time and also air time . This show was not repeated on ITV2 / 3/4 yeah thats how good it is. <br /> <br /> I would say not by th box defines only a waste of money. <br /> <br /> CAUTION
