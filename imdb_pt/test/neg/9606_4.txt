I tried to give this show a chance, but I really do not like it very much. Although the performances are good, the writing is not. The two older brothers, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I have the impression that we should stay with Casey, given that she is the protagonist, but I do not find her at all sympathetic. Parents are continually portrayed as totally clueless. The three youngest children are the most watched things in the program; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet as they come together, and Marti is lovely. The plot lines are a little overdone and the whole premise is hard to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family is not really trying so hard to mingle. Overall, I think that's a negative sign.
