This is a title in search of a movie. It's a deal that sounded profitable to some studio executive and the rest to be cursed. When this movie was made, there were still two things CGI did nothing about: people and furs. Hairy people were therefore not meant to look good when processed by computer. This is the only example where I can think of where the effects of a well-funded sequel have taken a big leap back, well behind those of the original film. For the record, the design of the werewolves does not help at all. The filmmakers apparently could not decide between quadrupeds and bipeds, they tried to do both, and they ended up with a creature that looked equally awkward anyway. The transformations are anatomically absurd and the end result, with a relatively high forehead and short muzzle, looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass part. This is a movie that exists PURELY to make money with your ancestor. I'm not a fan of the original Landis movie, but boy, it looks good in view of that. If you thought that some Landis humor was forced, try some of the excruciating attempts here. The chewing gum scene, the mood of the corpse, the dog that ... you know, you're just gonna have to see it bite. Thomas Everett Scott is on holiday in Europe with his friends and decides to take a break to act in the "ugly American" and bungee jumping at the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night. This leads him to rescue a young woman (Delpy - Julie is not worth it just to become a star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) to jump to death She turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are planning ... I'm not sure, something bad. No matter, the studio cared only that the title would probably fool millions of American Werewolf in London fans into giving their money. For the most part, happy to say, they were wrong.
