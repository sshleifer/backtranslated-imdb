This movie came as a big disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid twist and the hasty introduction of a very lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie all loose ends. Unfortunately, this did not happen. He added more holes than solved and confused more than clarified. The animation and dubbing were great, but with an idiotic plot, a monotonous setting (most of the film does not even happen on World War II) and a disappointing ending (Ed is useless for the rest of his life). days in a world without alchemy, and he abandoned Winry?), was very beautiful without dullness. Do yourself a favor - disregard the last half of the anime just like this movie, and read the manga.
