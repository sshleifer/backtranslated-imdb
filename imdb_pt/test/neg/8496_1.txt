Mr. Kennedy should stop EXPERIENCING with bad movie scripts. What was he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the stage of "hey, I have an idea, let's do a continuation". If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it, but I think I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems nowadays that if there is a buck to be done, movie executives will unearth an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what appears. (Hey, I said "hit and run!" Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How this piece of junk has seen the light of day is beyond me. It's full of nasty humor, weird animations and jokes that lead to nothing but a state of confusion. If you are being dragged into this movie, and someone else is paying for you .... well .... but it will still be more painful than a brick on the forehead. However, if you are considering paying for your own hard-earned money, look for a better alternative.
