I do not see the point. It's heavy. Lively people are scary (look at a strange valley). The scenes continue and continue with very little purpose. The plot is skeletal and must be filled with heaps of dramatic and senseless rollercoasters, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the film. Most characters are annoying and unpleasant. Some of them continue to appear as if they had something important to add to a weather scene. They do not. They simply disappear without any lasting impact. Someone summed up how "if you do not believe in Santa Claus, you will be abducted on a train on Christmas Eve". That pretty much sums it all up.
