Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and the dubbing were perfect for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of that movie; mainly in concept. After that, the joke ran out. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of a joke that lasts a long time. <br /> <br /> Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, has several raw and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, this is all good for the boy's pet rat, as it does not contribute anything else to the story. Eventually, I was as bored with his remarks as I was with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of South Park and other adult-oriented animations. I also play several pimp online games, so I'm partial to stories about pimps. The transition from the boy to the lil pimp was brilliant; but after that, both history and dialogue became redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a five. It is worth observing the great concept and the performance of voice. Just do not expect too much or you will be quite disappointed.
