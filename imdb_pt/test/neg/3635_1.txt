This television program is stereotyped and unlikely in many of its aspects. <br /> <br /> First, the scenario. All the characters participate in the PCA, this unbelievable boarding school with painted and elegant dorms. The campus does not seem to have reasonable rules - for example, boys are often seen in girls' dorms and vice versa. But this may simply be because the dorm advisor, a silly character who basically annoys the viewer instead of amusing them, since I suppose their purpose should be, sits and does nothing. I have friends at boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of school at this show. <br /> <br /> Then the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not creative with the personalities of this show. Zoey is supposed to be perfect at everything he does (looks, notes, sports, boys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is the athlete, Logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing In addition to aggravating all the characters, just like we, poor viewers, Nicole is the idiot who knows nothing, but somehow keeps the straight, Dana was the tough girl, Quinn is the unrealistic 'smart child', whom they always scoff, Chase is the guy who is afraid to confess his "true feelings", which really aggravates me as the show continues, and this new girl - Lola or something - is just another clone of Nicole. <br /> <br /> The two main characters that aggravate me most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I just do not understand Zoey's character. She was obviously meant to be the 'perfect' character like I said above, but she seems to be the fauxest of them all - in most episodes she creates a problem, so she has to fix it. What is frustrating is that we should love her and think she is amazing when they have not even created a very realistic character to begin with. Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point where her character is absolutely insulting. The impression I get from Nick about his character is that "geeks" and "nerds" are people to laugh at, criticize, mock. In the spring episode they made a year ago, they introduced two more "nerds" that the characters had to make "cool". I found this highly offensive and stereotyped. What kind of message is Nick sending to these kids? It is: do not do well in school, do not get good grades, do not study hard - you would end up being a geek and mock your profession in future TV series! Because that's definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters, and it's a horrible message altogether. <br /> <br /> All I can do is hope that Nick one day realizes that by knocking down the smart people in our world, they are doing no good to anyone.
