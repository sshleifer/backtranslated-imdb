Let me first state that I really wanted to like this movie. In most cases, the actors and actresses seemed to be a part of them, and did quite well in their roles, but the film had no real plot. He seemed so blessed to look "crazy" that no interesting story shone. In addition, camera work was often sloppy, trying to snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. Most of the time, the scenes meant to look cool turned out to be confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some of the characters were just ... stupid. The cute, crazy boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh OK. Overall, a fat stinking 1/10. Not worth your time.
