I got into this particular movie to like. I usually like dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc ... I got into this movie thinking that it would be on the edge of my place. Also, I'm a big fan of Pacino. <br /> <br /> What a piece of rubbish. Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in five years. This makes Pacino's collapse in Any Given Sunday look good. First, half of the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. Okay, we understand. You're in shape, Matt. We do not need to see all the other scenes with you pumping iron, no shirt. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how many holes are in this movie? Why present the phone call of Brandon's lost father and never talk about it again? What was the point of her mother turning him off - why even call her to say he's sending her a lot of money? What was the point of this? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in NY and recognized as illegal, how can they guarantee everyone's bet in the end? <br /> <br /> This was simply a poorly written script. It had potential, but it was devoid of a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his lesson about script selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My God, this is the same actor who starred in the godfather! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
