Corey Haim plays a boy who joins a dog to pick up a giant troll and an OSA attack man (Michael Ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (which is plausible considering Haim) Oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend also in this watchable but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is terrible, of course, but the absolute impetus of the film, as well as the imposing presence of Ironside, makes this film at least modestly effective. Still, the plot is ridiculous and would have been better if we could have seen a monster or at least more blood. At least it's something different. It is also quite likely that this movie will be the last teen movie for a while to show a teenager making tube pumps. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
