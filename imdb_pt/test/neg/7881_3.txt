Well, how to make a movie as provocative as possible? This shocking cartoon tries to convince two low-income Parisian women (a prostitute, a recently raped ex-porn actress) to attack men and women in particular. <br /> <br /> A very short time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this wildly hardcore "Thelma & Louise" - but it is done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message ... And since we don Do not get too close to the protagonists, violence actually seems choked up and numbing - and maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, I always welcome when the "serious" film industry dares to contain complete sex scenes. But the question is: does it work for the film as a whole? It's good? Here, not much, although we have a new meaning for the phrase "a shot in the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
