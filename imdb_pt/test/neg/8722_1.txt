What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving the film version of Lynch, I was extremely disappointed. I felt like I was watching a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like the remains of a Star Wars TV special! I felt that the acting was a bit amateurish by the majority. The costumes were gaudy and finished, which gave the feel of the 60's Flash Gordon pulp. The worms! They are supposed to be Sand Worms and yet they looked like "big stalagmites" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were very good in secondary terms. I'm not even going to start talking about the shameful "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called "Frank Herbert's Dune" was not at all faithful to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies". The main plot elements were left out, the names changed and the whole "feel" of the story was "sanitized". I did not even recognize the Harkonnens! In fact, most of the characters did not look anything like Herbert's descriptions. I'm starting to get pissed off just remembering what a tragedy that was. I'm happy I can not handle the second installment ....
