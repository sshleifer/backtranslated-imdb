I got this movie on DVD with the title Evil Never Sleeps, it gives the front bill to Carrie Ann Moss, but she plays such a small character that I did not really notice her in the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I'll consider this one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The dialogue was blossoming and the delivery of wood, I found the performance disconnected from the plot. Graham's performance for me was from someone who is wondering if she left gas at home. <br /> <br /> In general, both my wife and I find this movie painful to watch, and it is not a valuable addition to my work. Collect, watch your risk, but spending 90 minutes with nails ripped off would probably be the best way to spend your time.
