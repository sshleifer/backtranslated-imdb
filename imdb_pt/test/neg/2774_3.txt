This is a cheap movie! A stripper is still being attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. She goes to the police who also rapes her. She finally finds a child who was also attacked by the zombies and they track the zombies back to 'The Zombie Master'. The fact that Stephanie Beaton plays the stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
