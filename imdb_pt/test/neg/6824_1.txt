Rourke does his usual part as an idiot, rancorous, neanderthalian, fierce, evil idiot, in the same mold as in "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of the trash in which he is. <br /> <br /> It has few lines. Of course, all this is just rubbish, underestimating Rourke, humiliating him, and it does not matter to his characterization as an actor. Still, after seeing "A Prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome" , "Barfly", "9 1/2 weeks", "Year of the Dragon", etc., etc., for For many years, I considered Rourke an intelligent, intelligent and prominent man. I think he has changed since then. <br /> <br /> He seems insensitive, calcined. <br /> <br /> "He walked with a dark appearance; / Despair inhabited his chest / And made the man a perfect plague." (Belloc, "The Example"). <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no other reason to watch this bland movie except that Rourke was inside.
