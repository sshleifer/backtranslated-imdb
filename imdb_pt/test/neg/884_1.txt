Let me get this straight: <br /> <br /> "A plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with a newly separated bed and breakfast hostess within 24 hours meet her because of her solid advice on the bedside manner. "Wow. Move "The Notebook", there is a new kid in town. <br /> <br /> Where to begin. Well, what about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can safely summarize the basis of this eternal love in the following steps: 1. Exchange polite courtesies with a salad bite. 2. Drink large quantities of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Provide unsolicited advice to each other in their bad lives. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Dedicate your lives to each other via airmail. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe has "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" in his dossier. "Stick with your gender" would be too hard? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, laugh or even wait. But the reason they are able to do this is that, somewhere during the plot, we really begin to worry about the characters we are watching on the screen. To make us take care, there must be time spent developing these characters ... their lives, their history, why we are watching now. Wolfe did not seem to want to "waste our time" on such trivia, and instead provided us with about 8 minutes of background information on each character before launching ourselves into an intense one-on-one interaction between two actors. Everyone comes to love, but two CHARACTERS that we could care less about. For a brief moment of tenderness, when Richard Gere exclaims that he does not expect her to listen to her problems, and she invites him to dinner, the viewer sees a glimpse - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. But instead of being able to enjoy the anticipation and enjoyment of "what happens next" in the wonderful and unpredictable joy of dating, we are thrust headlong into a love affair between two people we barely know. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. We've all heard of a movie in romantic movies. But the reason we cut a slack for Bogart in "Casablanca" or Nicholson in "Something's Gotta Give" is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the skies and dragged by the mud and back with these characters, and the moment they deliver the line, we are so deeply involved with their situation, nor do we realize the cheese factor. As Wolfe does not allow us to love or even like our protagonists, all we have left is a cheese sandwich and a few giggles in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes the old Hollywood director's phrase "cut to the chase" quite literally here. As each of the liners is delivered by our cast, the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally telling the audience, "Come on, it's a Richard Gere novel. <br /> <br /> It is as a result of this striking lack of character development - or relationship - that the film's climax fails miserably in our hearts. When Gere's character dies, I felt like I was watching the news about someone I did not know passing by. Or watch a rowing race during the Beijing Olympics. Only. Did not. Caution. <br /> <br /> Epic. Failed.
