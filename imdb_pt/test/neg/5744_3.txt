This is about some vampires (who can run in the sunlight) who are causing some problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent with his command team to investigate. The movie begins with Van Dien & Co. walking through the jungle, and has this huge black guy who absolutely, positively, can not act. He speaks all his lines as if he were reading the chips for the first time. Her voice is also so low that, well, it's positively hilarious. Great way to start the movie! Anyway, they come across some of our vampires, shoot them (this makes them look like dying for about 20 seconds), and then, of course, they come back to life. Van Dien realizes that one of them was impaled on a tree branch and screams with his friends to kill them with wood. The stunt work must be seen to be believed - vampires are in wires that pull them up from the trees, which supposedly makes them appear to be able to climb easily, but this makes it look like they are jumping on bungee jumping ropes or something like this. <br /> <br /> Yes ... anyway, later, the huge black guy is in South America with some guys (Van Dien not included), and they are attacked by more vampires. It's really bad these guys have never heard of a beast because it seems to be the perfect weapon to kill the leeches, but instead they use large wooden stakes that try to impale the vampires by hand. The big black guy ends up being captured and he eventually becomes a big and powerful vampire leader. Van Dien ends up fighting him later. It does not help that throughout the movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, it will be eliminated for 20 seconds or more, which would allow a person to put a stake in them easily. They just try to put stakes on them in the middle of melee combat. Yes, not exactly brilliant tactics. <br /> <br /> There's a hot one (remember Veronica from the TV show The Lost World? Yes, it's her!) Who also walks around in the middle of Vampire County on some kind of research mission, and she is also the ex-wife of Van Dien. Hey, what are the odds? It's a shame she's not in the movie much more than she is. Will she and Casper return together at the end? Will Van Dien will defeat the huge black guy who can not act? Will vampires of circus performers make you laugh at all the myriad action scenes? Are we going to hear the three goofy songs when someone does something funny? Lynda Carter has forgotten how to act in her little cameo (she is most convincing in her Sleep Number Bed commercials)? These questions and more will be answered if you get to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know, this can score a few points on the bad, it's a good scale, but it's about that. It's a bunch of idiots running through the jungle, I think it's fun.
