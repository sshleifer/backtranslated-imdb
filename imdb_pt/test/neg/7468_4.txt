I saw the Grande Ecole in its world premiere at the Rotterdam Festival. I had no idea what I was getting into and if I had any idea I would not have entered. This is the most pretentious movie I've seen in a long time. He tries to be provocative, but profound, with his front homosexual sex scenes - unsuccessful! It's nothing but a bad excuse to show people naked on the big screen. 4/10
