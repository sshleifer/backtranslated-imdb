I barely know where to start. <br /> <br /> Huge issues of continuity, bad acting, etc. For example, Sam must be away from anyone but you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his. But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Sam's adventure paving way to improve the whole lot her family, is not even touched. Instead, in the movie, he becomes angry with his family and leaves his parents rich to be alone, and when he gets tired, goes home. Where is your development? Where is the bow? <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book and can go through the horrifying 60Ã­sis (double / triple / quadruple visions of the hawk) and poor quality of production (crackle, aham, fire, winter winds, stop their howls for dialogue and then reboot, etc.). I think * may * be OK for an 8 year old. <br /> <br /> But compared to the sophistication of the book, it is a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
