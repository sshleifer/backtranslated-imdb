"Shuttle" is an independent thriller about four young adults who travel late at night on an airport bus to discover that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. <br /> <br /> Although some of the sequences scares and is unusually interesting plot work, some aspects simply do not. The bad dialogues and the nice characters give a good reason not to care about them. But often the suspense works and asks the question "What would you do?" and generally what you would do is not what those bus idiots do. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting a stupid and bloody horror movie, you'll be wrong. This is a movie that makes you use your mind, but unfortunately not until the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
