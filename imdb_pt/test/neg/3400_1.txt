It was as if someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrible, taken to the directors another movie that seemed to happen every minute, the video of the ghost hunt was edited like a horror movie instead of an investigation, they had house music and sound effects that distracted you from the what was happening. Thanks for losing 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, I would fly! Most were just people talking about the place. The episode of the Ghosthunters show that was there absolutely destroys how this show was. I'm so upset about the sci fi channel for playing this, I have not watched it since it aired.
