I had heard about this movie through a friend, it should be a thriller, but what I watched was not a "thriller." It was more like a weak attempt at one. Amber Smith was a plus - that may be giving her a lot of credit. The scenes she was in bed with actress Erika Michels were also thighs. The two actresses did not seem to click each other. Amber Smith was out of the league this gal, and definitely showed on camera. She did not look like these scenes. I was disappointed because a friend of mine, of course, had pumped this movie to be something "great", but in fact it was more like watching dime store porn.
