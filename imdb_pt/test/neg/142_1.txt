This movie is super excited !! I'm sad to say that I can watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that, I'll have to force myself to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It's totally stupid and very fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing this steel suit and the acting is really bad, especially what makes the Alien character.It is totally annoying! Do not waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other stuff instead of watching this movie. 1 of 10. If possible, it would give 0.
