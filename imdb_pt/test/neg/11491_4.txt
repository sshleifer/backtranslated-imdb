FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a plot that will suit the mood of the West's suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy like President Ruski who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalin's communism, but more to Hitler's fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come straight from Mein Kampf and not from Marx. And the madman has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. The American mercenaries flock to Russian Prez to fulfill their fanatical, genocidal dream, but then they enter Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze ... and, yes, things get really downcast and dirty. He is a former American agent who became a hobo, Jason Monk, who is recruited by the British government to see what the Russians are doing. As a cheesy sidebar, Swayze's character who is not Monk (!) Has spawned a Russian beauty Elena (played by the beautiful Marta Kondova) in his previous missions to the former communist state. Hardman Swayze does a reasonable job while trying to defeat the evil Russians. But young and unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the film as her naked, 18-year-old Russian daughter, Elena, who helps her father eradicate the terror that threatens his beloved Mother Russia.
