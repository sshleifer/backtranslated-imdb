Firstly, I must point out that I used to love Pooh Bear as a kid and I really enjoyed the movie Tigger, despite being in my 20s. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad that I was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> OK, OK I know this is a kid's movie and it's not meant for people like me anyway, but this is my opinion on the movie to other people of my A major drop in this film is heffalump itself, which has to be the most annoying character I've ever seen in a child's movie (possibly even more annoying than the child in Monsters). It has the most annoying voice and chatter around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, I know Pooh movies are not exactly loud but that was insulting even to the intelligence of a 2 year old! <br /> <br /> Second - where was the story? Previous Pooh Outings had a minimum of one point to the story, yes, I can see that this was about accepting people who are different to you in their hearts - but it really ran out and I felt like I had watched a 5 minute cartoon on children's TV. I do not have my own kids, but when I intend to show them quality children's films like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Finding Nemo (though they are very childish for me these days) I can see how they would be of great appeal to small children). Not so with this terrible attempt at a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing - IT'S NOT BEAUTIFUL Eeyore! He should have his own movie!
