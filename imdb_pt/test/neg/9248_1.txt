... or should I say unintentionally hilarious? Anyway, this is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I was laughing during the antics of some of the dumbest characters on this side of Homer Simpson. It's just one slapping scene on the forehead, painfully stupid after the other, while the cardboard cutouts, silly and silly replacing real humanoid characters, push, pull and drag the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe this movie to anyone, I would call it the mutant hybrid of Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber, and the Three Stooges, with a "climax" strangely similar to the episode of Family Guy in which the whole family gets into a punching fight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Advice to the Benson family: the next time you get a new pet, do the poor animal a favor and DO NOT name it Fred!
