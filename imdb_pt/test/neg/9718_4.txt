Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you will have a general idea for this photo. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax finish to leave the door open for a 2nd part. Let's hope someone has the good sense to spend their money wiser. I would suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to that 'Charmed' kicked his ass and I just watched that show to please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and watch DVD on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. Or better yet, download so you do not waste your money. The first 15 minutes were good. But the funniest line in the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says, "Kiss my butt Harry Potter" while driving off a cliff. Although they are not worthy of kissing Potter's butt, because Potter is so much cooler and at least his films have a story. The goblet of fire was even more frightening than that !!!
