Okay, you have: <br/> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Spine of England.) She killed in the first scene - that's right, guys; this show has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Colonel Ol O'Connell of the First War and now the Lord of the Manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as the damned lady of the mansion, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years after her cousin, but still glamorous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy boy next to. It's okay, they have full knowledge and consent of Colonel Cricket (the guy even comes over for Christmas!) Even so, she's attentive to the colonel enough to have told the toy boy his age (what a heartthrob!) < David McCallum, as the toy boy said, equally as naively glamorous as his grip. Pilcher could not invent any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a quiet job at the Circus. <br /> <br /> And finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, venerable director of the Venerable Girls' Boarding School, serving tea in her office with a hint of deep, poignant advice to life in the outside world just before graduation. His best advice: "I was only in Nancherrow (the manor house of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow it was not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - the time was, your character would have run the whole show. They do not write like that anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with such a cast and scenario, you have the reinterpretations of "Brideshead Revisited", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took on one-dimensional support functions because they paid very well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary jobs that exists (YOU name another!) <br /> <br /> First warning sign: lots of backlight. They move around in the open air - "hey, it's just the sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning: The Lady Leader cries a lot. When you're not crying, your eyes are wet. This is the law of romance: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. <br /> <br /> From now on, Leading Lady will be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third warning sign: LL really has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Still, I'm going to give Emily Mortimer a prize just for having to act with that searchlight in her eyes (I wonder, did they use contacts?) <br /> <br /> And finally, the fourth warning sign: female character screen is "Mrs." She is "Miss" or "Lady." <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, I still could not tell you who was chasing who and why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> In short: they all live in World War II without anything happening to them. <br /> <br /> OK, in the end, LL discovers that he lost his parents to the Japanese prison camps and the babies come home catatonic. Meanwhile (there's always a "meanwhile"), some young lady who LL had a crush on (when, I do not know) comes home from some hard war spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if she will find him there.) Both war victims are taken to recover in Nancherrow (SOMEONE has to be "taken" somewhere in these romance stories!) <br /> <br /> Great drama .
