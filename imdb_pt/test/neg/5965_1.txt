This movie is a complete and utter waste of time, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And coming from me, that's definitely saying something. In fact, I wish I had given negative stars instead of just classifying them as a horrible pathetic star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find the chupacabra legend interesting and I have a taste for cheesy horror movies. But I draw the line this time. <br /> <br /> Acting sucks. The male protagonist presents one of the worst performances of all time, looking and sounding unnatural when delivering his misspelled speech. The protagonist gives a slightly more palatable performance, but it does not really take much time. <br /> <br /> The chupacabra ... well, considering how low budget this movie must have been, the creature was tolerable. However, it looks exactly like someone wearing mask and body clothing. The mask is pretty detailed and may look cool in person, but not so on the screen. <br /> <br /> Speaking on screen, you think they could have at least used a better camera. It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder to cry aloud. Also not very good. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the one who wrote this abomination was thinking. Dialogue sucks and I just ... I can not describe how I feel about it. At least not without having problems with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It just is not worth it. If it appears on the TV and you have nothing else to do or watch, then * find * something else to do or watch. Read a book, listen to music, * anything. * Just do not subject yourself to it. If you do, you can not say that you were not warned. And for the love of God and Lady, do not rent this sucker. Not worth it, even if you have the chance to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.
