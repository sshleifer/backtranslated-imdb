This movie was offensively PC, predictable and clich√©. I could not imagine a movie that best exemplified the narcissistic and myopic preaching of Hollywood today. If you have not seen it yet, do not bother watching it. If you have, show some courage and tell people how horrible it really is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the film's inherent and infinitely racist message. This film has nothing to do with the real world and has little or nothing to add to any discussion of racism in this country. Instead, it's the kind of cheap, sensational crap that is promoted as deep and challenging thinking. What kind of bubble do you have to live to think this is impressive?
