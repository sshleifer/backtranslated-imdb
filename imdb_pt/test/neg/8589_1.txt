I've never seen a movie more unrealistic than this dirty manure. The performance was over. The direction was tacky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story seemed to be written by a person who has never been close to a football game, much less a professional game. And why did Oliver Stone feel the need to put himself in that movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer of all time. He could not even be hired for professional wrestling contests. So you have Jamie Foxx, who plays like a girl. But he's a little more athletic than the elderly Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to direct this movie to 16 year old men with ADD. That's why we hear loud music, quick cuts and numerous issues. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino for doing this crap. Cameron Diaz? Heck, the one with no talent takes on any role that goes down. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you are going to, well, your movie sucks! And this one does.
